I have owned my Pathfinder Hybrid SL for over 2 months now, and the more I drive it, the more I love it.
It is way more vehicle than I needed (that's why I almost walked away from getting it) but the dealer made me one of those offers that one would be stupid not to take...so I took it! Although the PF got only slightly better gas mileage than my old RAV4 in the beginning, I have discovered that I can get pretty awesome mileage around town by coasting as much as possible, not putting 'the pedal to the metal' so much, and turning OFF the climate control whenever possible!! The first nice-weather day we had here in NY this spring, I had the windows open and got 29.7 mpg!
