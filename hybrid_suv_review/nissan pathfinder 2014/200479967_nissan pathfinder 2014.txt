We bought this pathfinder back in Oct 2013 we have put over 15,000km on it and have had no problems up until after the first oil change and tire rotation.... since then its been making a loud noise and the faster we go the louder it gets it almost sounds like a lawn mower or weed wacker when we get up to 110-120km per hour!! if I put the car in N and rev it up I do not here the sound only when I am driving. I love this car but this noise is not cool I guess Ill find out what it is when it goes in today. other then that I have had not other issues other then the recalls which can be expected when you launch a new model, it always takes time to work out the unexpected bugs.

We purchased our 2014 PathFinder SV on a very snowy presidents day.
In the last few months we have logged almost 5,000 enjoyable, uneventful miles.
This includes a road trip and numerous trips to sporting events hauling 4 kids, 2 adults, and 3 sets of hockey equipment.
The ride is great, handling good, and acceleration smooth.
So smooth that it is accelerating faster than you at first realize.
Mileage has been very good, usually 22-23 in mixed driving (overdrive enabled, towing mode disabled for normal driving).
I am looking forward to seeing how well it handles our boat.
No shudders, or hick-ups, at all... Just enjoying the ride.
