Well these must be selling lot hot cakes because the dealer tried to add $500 to the price when we picked it up.
We ordered the Limited in order to get the safety package toyota calls the "tech package".
the tech package costs $1500 but of course only available on the highest trim - worked on us.
I took the car to work on volunteered to drive everyone to lunch.
OMG how embarrassing, each guy only got one "cheek" on the back seat.
dont try to stuff three grown ups in the back seat, it doesn't work.

I have owned both a BMW x3 and a Honda Pilot SUV's and now owned a 2014 Toyota Highlander Limited. Although my previous SUV's were good, this Toyota SUV has surpassed my highest expectations.If you are looking for a smooth ride, elegant interior, and decent towing capability SUV to drive your family around in, take a look into the all-new 2014 Toyota Highlander, you will find it hard to beat.
