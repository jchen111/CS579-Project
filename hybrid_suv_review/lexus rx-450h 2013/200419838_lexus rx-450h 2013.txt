Please don't get the Hybrid version if what you want is to save on gas. 

Gas required for this vehicle is Premiun, so you'll pay more at the pump.

The tank takes about 14 gallons and I get about 300 miles about 22 mpg.

I believe "Hybrid cars" are just a trend that does little or nothing for the environment. It does Nothing for your wallet.

I think the only good thing I heard about Hybrid is that there's no smog check ever. 

It's extremely distracting every time you're looking at that dashboard to see if you're saving any gas. I won't recommend the hybrid version.

Had a Highlander, drove that and the rx350 and Rx450, the rx 450 beat the others. 
It's extremely quiet, powerful, luxurious, outstanding build quality and we think very nice looking.
It takes getting used to a hybrid in day to day driving, as it doesn't jump off the line unless you want it to. It's almost a game seeing how good of mileage you can get.
We are getting at least 28 mph in city driving. We intend to keep this vehicle at least 8 years, and gas is not going to get cheaper so it will pay for us in the long run. 
The ride on the 450 is smoother than the 350 due to the extra weight of the batteries.
We have had zero problems or defects in the 7k plus miles we have driven.
