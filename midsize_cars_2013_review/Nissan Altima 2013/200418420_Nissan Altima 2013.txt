Bought my car July 2013.
So far I really like it, but a few issues to note:

1) Gas milage isn't what was advertised, especially since the weather turned cold in Nov.

2) When coasting in traffic at 20 mph, I sometimes get a significant shaking when I step on the accelerator.
Sometimes the shaking is strong enough that it's embarrassing.
It doesn't happen very often though

3) The "premium" sound system sucks.
It sounds like something I would expect from a Toyota Corolla.
It's very disappointing, espeically since it's supposed to be an upgraded system.

I've had my Altima since the first of February, 2013. It's now 8 months and 11,500 miles later and the car is great! My Altima is fully loaded except for the "remote start". I test drove the new Honda Accord, VW Passat, Kia Optima and Toyata Camry. For me the Altima had the most quiet and smooth ride with a bit of sports car feel...thanks to the 3.5 V6. I felt at ease in the seats and overall driving position. The V6 has plenty of get up and go, but if you're wanting fuel economy stick with the 4 cyl. For me, the CVT was to noisey with the 4 cyl. engine.

I regret ever buying the 2013 Nissan Altima.
At about 1,200 miles I started experiencing a jerking sensation when the CVT transmission went from 1st to 2nd gear at about 15-30 mph.
It took months for Nissan to issue a service bulletin to fix the jerking, and then the fix required taking out the transmission to replace the torque converter.
As if that wasn't bad enough, my local Nissan service center here in Lynchburg, VA
DROPPED my transmission in the floor and broke it and the axle and had to order new parts.
There's no telling what else they damaged in the process since the 2 times I have talked to them they have been waiting on different parts.
I will NEVER purchase another Nissan!

After reading all the negative posts I was hesitant in waiting for my car to arrive in February. So far I have not had any issues with CVT shudder, and the heated seats worked as they should. There is a very slight power steering whine but for me it is not noticeable unless everything is off and you are listening for it at low speeds.
I have really enjoyed this car, I have taken it on two long distance trips (have 6,000 miles on it) and the ride was quite and comfortable. The crazy thing is, the car is rated for 31 miles mpg on the highway and I had gotten 33mpg, 35mpg and a whopping 37.5 mpg on three different fillups, the lowest being through the mountains.

This car is pretty amazing! I fell in love with it when I first saw it. When it was time to buy, I narrowed my two choices down to the new Accord and this Altima. I ultimately chose the altima.I regret buying a this car. The CVT engine is the main problem. It shakes and shudders when you accelerate off the line. I did my research and from my understanding., CVTs are suppose to be smooth sailing. They are suppose to hold their RPM steady until you apply a diffrent amount of pressure on to the pedal. When I accelerate, the rpm goes up to about 2000 then it drops down to the 1000's and i feel a shock/shutter. Until nissan fixes this car's engine, DONT BUY THIS CAR! The value of the car willdrop

Great MPG highway. On a recent trip from D.C. to NJ I got 34.2 round trip.

Short, slow(city), and hilly driving is another story. That kind brings MPG way down.
The car does have a kind of 'groan' while accelerating or maintaining low-medium speed but I don't find it bothersome. Otherwise it's quiet.
The CVT is awesome in Ds mode. Very nice acceleration.
I have tehe heated seat issue where you get heat either at bottom cushion or the back but not both at same time. Repair attempt failed. Need to go back with it.

I test drove a 2013 Altima 2.5 last fall and did not like the sound of the CVT transmission with the 4 cyl. engine. I drove a 3.5 SL with the V6 and loved it, but I put off getting one.

I recently leased a 3.5 from Mossy Nissan in San Diego and the car is fully loaded!! It's great to drive, comfortable, quiet, smooth with plenty of power when it's needed. Although I only have 550 miles on the car at the moment, I can say I'm impressed with it and think I made a great choice. My first choice was a VW Passat, but the design was blan to me, especially the dashboard area, and VW just couldn't meet the lease terms Nissan offered.

Disappointed from day 1! Got car & had more miles than expected! Paint defects. Who lets a brand new car get to a customer with stickers Under Yes under the paint? Brake light comes on, shutter from transmission getting worse every day, mileage on gas upon fill up changes, sensor in seat never always shows no one is in the seat, heated seats do not work properly, annoying noise from electronic steering getting louder, paint peeling off front bumper= been painted 4 times! Yes & the paint is peeling AGAIN! Went to dealer to get out of this car & they want me to lose 4,000.00. Ha Nissan are you kidding! Wouldn't the news love to see the defects in all these reviews! Shame!

I've had the car for 3 months now & it has been in the service dept 4 times. The washer fluid wasn't coming out, they had to fix the hose. The passenger door makes a horrible noise when opening & closing, like a 1980's oldsmobile, the metal is rubbing together, thought they fixed it but NOT! When listening to music on a certian volume something in the car is rattling & it drives my crazy! They tried fixing it by putting more foam in the headliner, didn't work. So now I get to yet again take it back to the dealer & try to have it fixed. Also, the back up camera sucks! Can hardly seen anything at night. Radio was better in my 2008! Rear vents don't work well either.

Just purchased a 2013 Altima 3.5 SL. Aboslutely love the car for the $. Did an extended test drive and fell in love. BUT, didn't purchase the car I test drove.


Apparently there is a low-pitched whine that is linked to the power steering that some of the Altima's have and other's don't.
The test car didn't. It can only be heard clearly when the windows are up and the radio is off. But once you know it's there it's almost impossible to ignore.
Recommend turning on the car and listening before purchasing.
