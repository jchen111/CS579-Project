I traded an '06 Ford Five Hundred for the '13 Fusion.  I wanted a slightly smaller car with sportier handling and better gas mileage.  I looked at and drove the Honda Accord, Mazda 6 and Nissan Altima while I was shopping.  I settled on the Fusion due to its styling, and ideal (to me) combination of responsive handling, great ride and interior quiet.  The other cars I drove are great choices, to me the Fusion was ideal.  Outside of a recall, I've had no problems with the car.  T

Transmission started jerking at 6,000 miles.
Gas mileage not even close to advertised on window sticker. Features are out of this world for the price and the leather is great.
Headliner screws keep coming loose and everything rattles in the car.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After putting 20k miles on this vehicle in almost 18 months of owning it I had to trade my Fusion Titanium in.
Why? Ecoboost engine is not ready for prime time.
On a pure highway trip of 300 miles, utilizing cruise control the entire way, after a recent dealer service (oil change, tire rotation, etc.) I could not break 27 MPG.
In 80% city driving, from my granny of a wife, the car averaged 17 MPG and less than 300 miles/tank.
On the day I traded it in, a cheap piece of plastic randomly broke off from around the sun visor as I drove onto the dealer lot.
I wanted to love this car because of the sexy looks.
It just couldn't live up to it's promises.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have had my Fusion for 5 months and it has been great.
Drives well, good fit and finish, quiet, great sound system and electronics.
Exterior styling is excellent and gas mileage is good (averaging 25.4 miles driving mostly city).

MySync is good but has had a couple of hiccups that required taking it to the dealer to get a newer version of the software installed.
Dealer did the job quickly and threw in a free oil change so I was happy.

Highly recommend the vehicle.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall I absolutely love this car!
I saw a picture of it about 1 year before it was on the market and said I will own one and so I do.
I still look forward to getting into it every morning going to work and when I get off work I look forward to driving it home.
I have driven many supercharged cars and turbo cars.
Although this isn't the most powerful one it still has plenty of
power to get into traffic, pass someone, or get out of the way.

I bought a 2013 Fusion Titanium with 2.0L Ecoboost engine.
I drove it against the BMW 3-Series, Audi A4, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and VW Passat.
The Fusion felt much more solid than the Altima and Passat and competitive with the Accord, A4 and 3-Series.
It is incredibly refined, quiet with great ride and handling, second to none of the above cars mentioned.
I chose the Fusion over the BMW and Audi because it was just as nice for far less money.
I have owned the car for 9 months now and still marvel at how great it looks and how much car it is for the money!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just got a 13 Fusion Titanium 2.0 with 19" tires and have approximately 400 miles on it.
I was concerned reading some reviews about the mileage but the first tank returned 26.5 mpg in mixed city and interstate driving.
The car is very comfortable, great technology which is easy to use.
I haven't had any problems with MyTouch but I'm familiar with Sync.
The MyTouch responds as I expected without issue.
The Sony sound system is very good.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have had this car for a few weeks.
Amazing ride, fun to drive, comfortable, quiet, full of useful technology.
Average 26 MPG with mixed driving (which is right in line with EPA averages).
I'm a young-ish LEO with a heavy foot but find no problems with the MPG as others have complained about.
The Sync works flawlessly; Ford offers unlimited classes to help master it for those who are apprehensive about it.
This is the first car I've ever bought where I've had zero buyer's remorse.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MPG is horrible on this car. I have a 1.6L Ecoboost, and I don't even get 23MPG which is the minimum advertised, and I drive it gently. At the best I am getting 22.5MPG. I am really disappointed. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have about 9200 miles on my Titanium FWD. For the most part, this is a great vehicle.
It is a nice driver and is quiet and comfortable.
It handles extremely well.
However, there are a couple of things that really make it hard for me to recommend to anyone else.
There is a problem with the gas tank that prevents you from putting much more than 12 gallons in when you are near empty.
The specs say 16.5 capacity.
So plan on spending a lot of time at the gas station.
My last car held 18 gallons so this is a huge inconvenience.
