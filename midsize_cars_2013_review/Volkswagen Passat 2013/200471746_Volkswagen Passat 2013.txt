First off, let me say I'v only had my 2013 Passat S for about three weeks, so don't expect any reliability reviews. But as regards my driving and build quality, well, read on. Yes, mine is the base model. Do I feel underwhelmed? No. The Passat S drives and handles just fine for basic family driving. Plenty of pep, smooth ride, and the "S"port gear when you need the extra oomph. So smooth is the ride that its easy to speed without knowing it. The interior is laid out cleanly and with all controls easily reached. LOVE the Bluetooth capability. Front seats are every comfortable. Huge leg room in back. And wow, what a trunk. I don't know how VW did it. Just wish the gas mileage were better.

i traded my cpo benz glk for a passat s.
i wanted german driving at lower cost.
i found it.
i tested automatics jetta and passat, 2.5, 1.8 and diesel.
the 1.8 really livens up the jetta, passat not so much.
diesel with dsg is sluggish in town and costly at 40k service.
i was most pleasantly surprised by the passat 2.5.
not alot of driving difference with passat 1.8, $4k cheaper (both cpo), 2.5 online reputation is bullet proof while 1.8 is too new, i prefer cloth to fake leather seats.
my 2.5 gave me 27mpg suburban dc area and 38mpg i95 and i64 dc to va bch, at or just above speed limits, hand calculated, almost unbelievable.
my advice:
try the passat in 2.5, great cpo deals now.
