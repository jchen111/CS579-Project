My last car was 2007 BMW 335i Coupe so I was worried about getting bored with a normal car.
Not so with the Accord Sports 4D or the Coupe with paddle shifter.
The 4 cyl is plenty powerful, quiet, great handling, & fantastic gas mileage.
I got the Coupe LX-S which is the base model yet it came with bluetooth, auto temp control, back up camera, cruise.
Missed my remote access but that's it.
Back to lower maintenance cost, less gas, & feeling smart about getting good value.
Got it at $22,393 with sticker at $24,990.
Damn good car for the money.
