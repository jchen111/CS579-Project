Hello 
Just bought the new buick encore. 
Well, I really like it! Fun to drive and great style. However less than 24 hrs from purchasing the car I hit something in the road and damage the front bumper. Well, now waiting for GM to get the part! My dealer has been great but looks like GM is not ready to service the car. It has been week and no confirmed date on when the part will arrive.

Nice car but you may be waiting if you have any damage and it needs repair.
