I bought the Escape SE in March.
About 1750 miles now.
Averages 25 MPG now, with conservative driving in the City.
About 50 miles a day.
Not tested on the highway yet.

We bought a 2014 Ford Escape SE with leather interior and the 1.6L ecoboost.
We have about 1000 miles on it and so far and are happy with our purchase at this point.
So far we are averaging about 23.5 MPG in town and 26.5 MPG on the highway.
Ford states the break in period is 1000-2000 miles and then you should start noticing your actual gas mileage.
I am hoping the HWY MPG does increase to at least 30 MPG as advertised.
We have taken a couple of 90 mile trips in the vehicle and was very comfortable to drive

After 6 years of driving a Ford Focus, I found that although I loved the car, I missed being in an SUV. I have a 2003 Explorer XLT that serves as our boat hauler/ camping vehicle, but needed something comfortable for trips to our mountain house. I've found it. This is an amazingly fun little SUV - handles well, and looks and feels like a much more expensive vehicle. One of the best driving cars I've ever owned. The gas mileage is not on par with my former Focus, but it's an easy trade off for the room and comfort in the Escape.

I have a '14 Escape SE with blinding dash lights.
According to Ford technicians, they are suppose to automatically dim in conjunction with the ambient light.
For example, if it is daytime and full sun, the dash lights are full bright.
Then as it gets toward dusk, the lights dim somewhat.
At full night, the dash lights dim more to avoid bright lights in one's eyes.
An alalogy to this would be like driving at night and an oncoming car has its lights on bright beam.
Then as a courtesy, the person dims the lights to the low beam.
This is why I am kaking Ford to task for designing a car that won't dim its dash lights as specified.

We bought a 2014 Escape and noticed the following:<br>
- no driver storage for wallet, change or anything ...only 2 cup holders when not being used;<br>
- glove box is out of reach even for a tall driver and offers no storage capacity;<br>
-transmission blocks dash controls;<br>
- MPG :/<br>
- Center console is useless as a 1.5 foot narrow fishing hole that houses the USB connection half way down;<br>
door panel cup holder is non-functional as it's too narrow to fit our drinks;<br>
some interior plastic is not wearing well;<br>
firm narrow seats

I traded my 2012 Honda CRV for the 2014 Ford Escape to escape the Honda's horrible cabin road noise problem.
In my humble opinion, the Honda was built on the cheap, while the Escape's interior materials are much better and the doors don't sound like tin cans.

Bought 2014 SE model two months ago after testing 2014 Mazda CX 5 and 2013 Toyota Rav 4 as contenders. Although it was a difficult decision we decided with the escape after receiving several thousand off and more options then the other two. I have the 1.6 liter engine and has been great accelerating then expected from expert reviews. Although common by many other consumers reviews
from the 2013 it has not yet unfortunately lived up to EPA estimates of 22/30 MPG. Highest has been 25.2 on highway after only 900 miles though. We shall see if break in period makes a difference soon enough. As for the talked about My Ford Touch, well I couldn't be any happier!
Escape is quiet and handles great.
