I downsized from 2010 Buick Enclave because i don't need that big vehicle for my small family, but still i tried to compensate the ride comfort for the substitute vehicle. So the ride quality compared to enclave is the same other than Rogue is 1500 lbs lighter. It is fun to drive where as enclave was a chore to drive in city and locally.
It has more technological features - electronics and trace control, ride control and engine braking. 
Ride comfort: it is quiet, smooth , less wind and tire noise, light steering on low speeds and precise on highway speeds, very little body role - you can drive this like a car other than the acceleration part.The only negative is NASA inspired seats.

This crossover is designed for luxury!
It's wonderfully appointed & plush with padded dash, plush padded door armrests & center console as well as the most comfortable seats. Mine included navigation upgrade and panoramic moonroof.
It is impressive!

I've had mine < 3 months and average between 23.3 and 28 MPG CITY driving.

Acceleration is not an issue.
I notice that I am still way ahead of about 90% of traffic when leaving an intersection without even close to flooring it.
Buy a Mustang if you feel you HAVE to be 1st.
No acceleration safety issues here!
I was sold on the 2014 RAV4, but is just simply cheap looking and feeling compared to 2014 Rogue. Toyota really screwed up.

I researched which car to buy for months and when I saw the re-design of the Nissan Rogue, I knew they got it right.
Went and test drove the Cr-V, the Insight, and then the Rogue.
The SV had cloth seats, which I prefer, but I could get a panoramic sunroof and the back-up camera with this model.
That was all I needed.
The car is super sharp in black, it's just a pleasure to own, it's so well made. I highly recommend this car.
I think that for future models, they will give the engine a bit more juice - it could be peppier.
But I don't care as much about that, and it's plenty responsive for me.
I feel so pampered in this car -- highly recommend.

We did countless hours of researching crossovers, compared all of the models and test drove a few.
We fell in love with the Rogue after seeing the redesign and learning about all of the great standard safety features for such a reasonable price.
We are going from a Prius to this, so the promised 29-33 MPG was a big selling point. Unfortunately... I have yet to get more than 25 MPG!
(I bought the FWD version instead of the AWD to keep the MPG at the higher end... we are quite disappointed.
We are hopeful that it will improve, but so far very disappointed.)

I love this vehicle!!! I had a 2014 Honda CRV for a week and traded it in for the 2014 Rogue and am so happy now!
I haven't finished mstering all of the buttons and commands yet but will have it shortly.
The ride is very comfortable and don't hear any engine strain at all when accelerating.
Haven't determined yet what the actual gas mileage is but will update later on.
All of the features are great and it is SO comfortable to drive
If the warning beeps get to be annoying I can and will shut them off, but for now not so bad.
This vehicle should be, and hopefully will be soon, #1 in it's class. Just wish the auto dimming mirror came standard.
