I have owned other Jeep Wranglers and this one by far has been the best! The new Pentanstar engine makes it, I have put on 33"s with a 2 inch lift and it still feels spunky when the engine decides to kick in.
This vehicle is great but it is has a few things that drive me crazy.

This is my first Wrangler, and it is everything I wanted and expected it to be.
I put off buying a Wrangler for decades because others told me it would be impractical and I regret having done so as I now have the vehicle I feel that fits who I am. One who buys a Wrangler isnÂt someone who cares about luxury features, speed or slalom figures on the racetrack, or smoothness.
They get a Wrangler because they want a JEEP.
This is one of the most capable off road vehicles out there, and it works well on the road also as a daily driver.
