I've had my 2013 Forester for about 7 months now and so far, so good.
It isn't the fastest, most luxurious, or most tech savvy car on the market, but what it is, is a great all around car.
In todays market there are not many CUVs you can run to the store in one minute, and then the next go out in the back country.
This is what made this vehicle so impressive to me being a Wyoming native who very well may do both of those activities in the same day.
This little crossover is just so well rounded and good at so many things it makes me happy everytime I drive it.
The interior does have some cheap materials, and the stock mud guards are terrible, but other than that I'm happy with my foz.

I bought the car new in September of 2012 and thus far it has been a great car. I have nearly 10,000 miles on it already and everyday i still look forward to driving it. It has the 5 speed manual tranny in it and
with that it has plenty of get up in go. The cornering on road is great for how big the car is and offroad it is even better. I have plenty of clearance for mild to moderate offroading and plenty of grip as well. Also performs excellent in the snow with no slipping unless i forced the car to do it. Highly recommended to anyone looking to buy.

Pondered buying one of these for 2 years, watched prices and finally took the plunge. Out the door for $21,998 with all the equipment I wanted/needed and nothing extra. Love the smooth shifting 5 spd, cargo space, comfort, and the visibility out all windows. Coming from a sport wagon to means I have to learn patience as this is not a speed demon and I'm ok with that.
