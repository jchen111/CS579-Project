I purchased my Subaru in Feb, 2013. The Subaru does very well in poor driving conditions - I used it through 3 snowstorms.
Get the winter package - heated seats and windows. But in regular conditions, the Subaru disappoints.
The engine is geared to punchy in city driving, which I like, but on the highway, the engine is all noise, and little pickup.
Once up to speed it is fine.
Gas mileage has yet to crack 21mpg in mixed driving.

Which brings me to the handling.
On city driving it is fine, but at highway speeds, the steering wheel vibration is pronounced - I gather from the forums that this is rather typical for Foresters.

Overall, a boring, but competent vehicle.

Obviously I am sold on Subaru.
This is my 5th Forester and the first I have had with power heated seats and telescopic steering wheel.
That makes all the difference in the world in comfort.
None of my Subaru cars have given me any problems, and all of the dealerships have been excellent to work with.
I appreciate the 7500 mile maintenance schedule and the self contained aspects which require no service at all.
2014 has a better transmission, but I could not pass up the 0% interest rate and great end of model year discounts.
Fit and finish seem to be just average, but I have no complaints as I didn't pay a premium price for an Audi, BMW, or Lexus.
Great small SUV!
