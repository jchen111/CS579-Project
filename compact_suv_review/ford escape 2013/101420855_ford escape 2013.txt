I purchased my Escape in the fall of 2012 and it presently has less than 12k in miles on it. Four recalls on this model. Sync system failed and the dealer reset it and said they could not provide the replacement part unless the system failed completely. I would not purchase an Escape until the problems are remedied on the factory level. for the Eco Boost engine. Presently back at the dealer with a low coolant/service warning, which I suspect has something to do with the last recall work not done correctly. I am contemplating trading as I am now uncertain of the vehicle's future.

Nothing But problems with this car.
it has just over 51,000 km on it and has been through 4 fuel pumps, 2 water pumps, a transmission rebuild and all engine gaskets have been replaced.
It recently bogged down on the highway with foot to the floor and only being able to maintain 70 km/hr.
Luckily got it home and parked it before it shut off on its own.
When brought to the dealership they could not find any problems and couldn't do anything to help solve the problem.
It was purchased new off the lot and have had nothing but problems since.
Over 3 years of owning there has been around $20,000.00 of warranty work done.
Would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.

We have owned our Escape for 1 year and 13,000 miles, and it has been very disappointing. We bought the car because it was great looking with great "advertised" gas mileage... and have been disappointed ever since!

The gas Mileage is not even close to advertised, more like 18-20 city, 24-26 hwy (on 2400 mile trip with cruise control) and 21=22 avg.

The interior design is at first comfortable, until you realize that other than a coffee mug there is no place to put any thing except the very narrow and deep center console storage (once down there forget about finding it again) also all the electronic plug ins are in there under the arm rest very inconvenient

Trouble almost from day one.
Car pulls to the side during acceleration, it shifts very hard like it is having transmission problems.
Had it recalled 3 different times leaving me with a rental car for weeks.
The radio does not always turn off when I open the door to exit the vehicle, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.
The rear lift gate doesn't always lock, it allows you to open it but then the alarm goes off.
You never know if the blue tooth system will connect to my phone thru the speakers or thru privacy mode.
Turning radius is horrible, and visibility is the worst in any vehicle I have ever had.
Trading it ASAP.

I traded in a Rav4 lease for this 2013 Escape.
On the plus side the power is fantastic and it looks great.
On the neg side less room than the Rav, milege is no where near the 30 highway even after reaching the 5K mile break in period.
Controls are difficult to reach.
Everything falls out of the glove box when you open it and it is very small.
It doesn't feel as solid.
This is my first American car in a long time.
I will go for the Honda CRV next time.
Very disappointed.

I purchased a new 2013 Escape 6 months ago. The vehicle look and rides great but the fuel mileage is terrible. It has been in the shop 3 times and still get 16 mpg in the city and 22 mpg on the highway. 

There are better buys out there for the money. I would not recommend it 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bought in early April and have 5000 miles so far. I love it. It has never been in the shop. I get 29 mpg or better if I drive 70, but that drops to 27 at 75-80. I use regular gas. If I mix highway and town driving, I get 26mpg. Live in FL and drive fairly gently. Have never had a problem with pairing my iPhone 4s. I love the Sirius radio and how you can optimize it for driver listening. Great quiet ride.

I traded in a 03 Explorer for the escapes "better" fuel efficiency, which was never achieved. Day 2 of ownership problems began with sync services freezing every other time. The car also developed a vibration through the break pedal that could be felt while stopped and in gear and was accompanied by the gas pump constantly clicking making it a chore to put gas. The interior would rattle and creak like a 100 year old home. Frustration continued with a creaking front suspension, replacing of the entire rack and pinion and constant trips to master reset the MFT system. Although eligible for the buy back program the Ford customer care manager was very rude and refused to follow through.

SEwith 1.6 Turbo. 4600 miles so far. Car is fast, fun and great on Gas. I get 25-26 with 50/50 Highway and City, straight up 33/34 on the interstate.
Anything over 80 it drops to 29. Very versatile. SYNC is weird, but it works. Takes and makes calls, but won't work with my Nano or Shuffle. Looks good, runs good. Waiting for an SVT version to come out.

I went to take a test drive with my wife as the Escape was the only small SUV I had not test driven yet.
I test drove the Equinox, Terrain, and the new RAV4.
After the drive in the new Escape, I was sold!
I got the SEL trim level, a two thousand dollar rebate, plus the X-plan for being employed as a Ford supplier.
The make-over for 2013 is a big improvement inside and out for the Escape.
Ford has done a good job redesigning the 2013 model.
I'm 6'-4" and 238lbs. and fit very comfortably in the Escape.
Love everything about it so far.
I don't understand all the negative reviews and I hope I don't experience any of the problems described by others.
Average of 28.5 mpg 70hwy/30city.
