I purchased this car after seeing a lot of good performance reviews and seeing an impressive 22/30 MPG sticker.
I go off road, camping, and projects regularly so I wanted the AWD and the space that a small SUV provides.
As of 30,000 miles - 
It handles well, dirt, water, snow.  It is a nice ride and very comfortable.
The bad:  17.5/22 MPG in PA, 19.5/24 MPG MD, all year round (and I tested it the old fashioned way of miles driven/fuel consumed, NOT the lying computer read out).  3 plastic parts including a handle broke within a year.  3 recall parts within the first year including overheating engine cylinders and a bad water pump.  SYNC has never worked properly in this vehicle.

Had a 2013 Ford Escape since April 2103. Got rid of it in July 2014. I was fooled by the seemingly positive reviews which swayed me over past experiences with Ford. Five recalls and a seemingly endless list series of issues. Some small like defective trim to some not so small. Things like the radio volumn which was never satisfactory or an issue with the cooling system which took three days to fix. 

Thankfully, the thing was still under warranty. Knowing Ford, I owned three previous Ford mistakes, better to trade.
Seriously, my BMW had way fewer issues than this Ford. Ford, never again!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This car had a major mechanical breakdown involving cam phazors at 730 miles, which required a major engine rebuild.
Then the recalls started... there are 10 all total for 2013 Escapes; 4 affect my car - two related to the engine catching on fire, one for air bag (RSM) module programming and one for "door latch problems that can lead to doors flying open while driving". The airbag RSM failed at 8600 mi.
Asked FORD to BUY BACK this vehicle, after the 2nd recall (engine fire). They REJECTED our request.
Today I was told they would "NEVER buy back our car".
Shocked to learn of 2 new recall issues 2 days ago, 5 days after the BB denial. Our FORD rep knew of safety issues but didn't tell us!!

I purchased my 2013 Ford Escape SE AWD 1.6 EcoBoost used October 2013.
Received a great deal from Ford dealer, this was preowned with 18,000 miles. Two months after I had to fight to get my rear tail lamps replaced due to water leaking in.
Ford requires 50% condensation and then pictures sent in.
This was unacceptable, Ford replaced. Overall, this was fun vehicle to drive.
Good pickup with Ecoboost but very hard shift jolting points with transmission.
Also the transmission seemed to lag when pressing pedal.
Center console is not long enough or big enough, along with glove compartment.
Long trips, seats feel hard. Luckily I had $1800 equity, traded for 2014 Toyota Rav4 XLE.

This car has been in my possession for 9 months. I drive a lot of company vehicles and rentals through my job, and this is just not a very good vehicle.
It is noisy, does not handle well, has very hard gear shifts at times, absolutely terrible rear view site lines, gets about 22.5 mpg with almost all highway driving (cruise control mostly).
For the price get a way better sedan, there really is not all that much more room it he trunk to warrant getting this over a good sedan.
Heck I had the fusion hybrid as my previous vehicle and it was great.
Oh, one last thing, the acceleration is inadequate, sometimes I need a quick burst for highway driving and there is a dangerous 2 second lag.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32,000 miles now.
Fuel economy is no better than 23 on the hwy.
car has improper gearing to ever see better. Many bad engineering and design flaws with this car. Still rides like a truck on bad roads. Engine noise galore..tired of it. Seems like gas pedal is not connected to engine at times. Sync is still playing the radio after I WALK AWAY WITH IT LOCKED. Cant turn on the front wiper with out the back one coming on, cant see the key slot to start the car. Last AWD car for me. I believe the suspension has 3-4" inches of travel. Bad roads bad ride.

I haven't had a single problem yet and bought it in march.this is my first ford ever and im pleased so far
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right off the bat I got 21.3 MPG in stop and go city traffic, 27 MPG limited Highway. I've had NO problems with Sync or My Ford Touch. My iPhone paired immediately and hasn't needed to be re-paired. My Ford Touch is totally different then operating Radio and Climate with Dials, Levers, or Buttons. Everything is on the touch screen is clearly marked. Spend 2 minutes to become familiar with NEW technology and you won't have a problem. Voice command works well, not quite like the Enterprise computer, and you might have to close the windows. Acceleration in the 2.0 is fantastic, Sport mode transmission gives quicker shifts and a more performance oriented driving experience.

I bought my Escape Oct 2012. I really didn't plan on spending so much time at the service dept. first my doors wouldn't all unlock when I got out of my car. (They still don't but they refuse to try and fix it) Then my radio wouldn't shut off. Yay,
fixed it. I have barley any air coming from my vents. Can't fix it. My brand new Samsung G3 doesn't sync with the system so know one can hear me. Still no updates from Ford. Now, my whole radio/sat/phone system won't work at various times and of course can't fix it because I have to bring it in when it happens which of course we know never happens when the shop is open. Black exhaust all over bottom of car. Told this was normal by service dept.

There is something wrong with the 1.6L engine & transmission combo.
My car has overheated twice after doing uphill climbs in the California hills.
I'm guessing the transmission is overheating since it never knows what gear to be in, which is causing the turbo to overheat.
Ford can't seem to figure out what's wrong though.
If you search on the DOT website for complaints, the overheating post recall is popping up a bit.
You can also see all the other transmission problems this car is having if you search around on the Ford Escape forums.
