I don't know what's going on with Honda, but it's not as used to be.
Build quality is definitely not up to par.
Bought a brand new CR-V a year ago.
After the first rain, it had a spare tire wheel compartment full of water.
It took dealership 3 tries and an external shop to fix leaking problems. Battery died when weather hit below 0.
This should not happen on a 10 months old car.
 Wheel wells have no protective covers.
Dealership told me it was done by design and the bare metal is treated for rust corrosion, but rust corrosion doesn't protect from stones chipping at the paint.
And to top it off, all lug nuts are rusted.
Car is 1 year old!!!
Very, very disappointed!

I can't drive this car on a trip. The headrest is tilted so far forward that I can't get comfortable. I have a neck ache for a week after a 300 mile trip.
My advice:
Drive this car out on the interstate for at least 15 minutes before you buy it.
I wish I had.
Also uncomfortable: The surface of the steering wheel is slippery plastic.
It makes my hand ache after 45 minutes of highway driving.
Again - DRIVE this car before you plunk down the money.
Make sure you fit in it comfortably.
I didn't drive it enough.
I regret it.
I should have gotten the Forester.

 

It's too bad that the car is so uncomfortable.
Otherwise I'd keep it forever.

One more time:
Do NOT test drive this ca

I love it.

This car lacks power, it is nice looking but it came defective. at 500 needed to be repair for defective components that made the check engine light go on, then i found water in the trunk. The car needed to be sealed and after the next rain, there is water again.
Not recommended!!
Although the sticker says it may give you 25-30 miles per gallon, it never does. The max was 22 mpg

Bought a 2012 CR-V LX Nov. 1, 2012 for $21,600 plus tax and license.
Gave away my 10 year old Matrix which had held up nicely.
Shopped online for best prices.
I saved $1,100 by buying from a dealer 70 miles north.
Honda seems to have anticipated what I want in a car:
good radio sound; easily read instrument panel; daytime running lights; radio controls on steering wheel; good acceleration; head room; comfortable back seats; height adjustable front seat; constant mpg readout; respectable gas mileage; those high and narrow taillights; headlights are good high and low.
The front seat seems almost to firm but most seats are a challenge for a tall (6ft 2in) driver.
I'd gladly buy it again.

Got mine from Honda of Ocala.
They wanted $35000 for a LX.
Going elsewhere next time.
That's the Honda location that Edmunds shows available models for on the sidebar automatically.
Just finished a trip with my LX and I got 32 mpg using cruise control and econ where as my wife got 35 mpg with econ and without cruise control.
Go figure.
It's nice being higher up than a sedan.
Comfortable trip.
13 hours each way.

My father decided it would be a good idea for me to get a car since i go to school in Buffalo. He is a previous Hillside Honda customer. and they made us happy once again. Everything was perfect. We were out of there in less than 4 hours! I chose the CRV because I am usually in a carpool back in buffalo. I absolutely love my car. The salesperson Steve was really professional and the sales manager Mr. Adams were extremely helpful. The process was smooth and painless. I couldnt have asked for a better christmas present. I would absolutely recommend it!

Yes, finally decided to get back into debt (after 5 of no car payments)...it was time, my 2002 CRV (which I bought new) already has 240,000. miles (that's right)...no engine or tramission overhaul has been needed....the car is still in excellent shape, so much that now it was passed to my son...
That's the main reason as to why I bought another CVR .... "RELIABILITY"..
The 2013 CVR LX has a very confortable ride, little wind noise in the highway, good visibilty, good handling.
