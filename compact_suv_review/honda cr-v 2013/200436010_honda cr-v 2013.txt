This nice car, I have bought this in 2013
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we purchased out 2013 CR-V a year ago.
it has been a solid performer, however the gas mileage for the class of car has a lot to be desired.
We like the roomy interior and the design of the vehicle.
It defintley has the room to take four to five people confortable, and the cargo space.
we use it each weekend to travel back and forth to the NJ Shore.
It has the space to hold everything without any issues.

6 month old crv doesn't start when its cold. One dealership checked it and said everything was ok. I went to a different dealership when it happened again and they didn't even check it, the guy just leaned back in his chair and said "that's normal, the crv has a small battery". The vehicle also sits lower on the left side than the right side. The dealership looked at it and told us something was definitely wrong with it. They took hours trying to figure it out then told us it was normal when they couldn't find the problem. So far we've had the CRV for 8 months and its been in the dealership several times. The body panels weren't even aligned properly when we bought it.

We parked my 2013 Honda CR-V on a < 30 degree incline, put it in park and turned off the engine.
After going behind it, opening the hatch and taking out 2 bags it began to roll backward.
I had the car for only 3 months and have had no warning of any problem.
I have reported this to NHTSA and am waiting for a resolution but will not drive this car again.
As a side note: even though I drive with ECO on, I have never gotten close to 30mpg.
The best is around 25.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We test drove this car during the day.
We were dumbfounded at how the exterior lights on this car are not pointed toward the road.
You can night drive at night unless you have your high beams on.
Good luck with that.
The dealer states nothing is wrong.
You have got to be kidding.
Only have 3,200 miles on it and this may be the first car that we dump that is less than 6 months old.
An accident waiting to happen!

i talked my wife into going from a Lexus rx330 to the '13 crv, and for the most part i am happy with the decision, but there have been a few small headaches. Driving home from the dealer is realized the right front turn signal was inop, then when i got home i saw the roof rail was coming up on the rr, and 2 valve stem caps were missing. Took it to a different dealer the next day and he replaced the bulb on the drive, but i had to come back to have the roof rail replaced. So a car with under 100 miles on it has been to the dealer twice. Hopefully these little gremlins are just a fluke, and from now on its just oil changes and basic maintenance.

I was so looking forward to purchasing my new car.
I did a lot of research and came to 3 top cars.
I chose the CRV and I think I made a big mistake.
It did not help that the dealer delivered a very dirty car to me and when I called to complain the salesman would not assist me.
The finance guy tried and tried to get me to put almost $2,000 on my loan for an extended warranty.
It would have been nice for someone to show me what the so called ten computers do instead of trying to upsell me so hard!
Now when I drive at night the exterior lighting is so bad that I almost always have to drive with the high beams on something I have never had to do with other cars.
Very bad experience!

I previously posted that initial 2013 CRV gas mileage was good, not great.
I may have underestimated Honda.
Just returned from a 300-mile round trip to Ocean City, Md., with 4 adults and cargo area piled up to rear window with food and clothing.
With engine warmed and driving a flat stretch of US 1 between Newark, DE, and OC--and keeping a steady 60 mph in eco mode--computer said I was getting 34.2 mpg (no stops or hard accelerations).
To make sure there was no advantage in descending elevation, I ran the same route in reverse.
Computer said I was getting 33.9 mpg.
If computer is accurate, this mileage suggests very high engine efficiency
--and better-than-EPA estimates.
Impressive.

 I am 6'2", 290# and can fit into front or back seats without banging head or knees.





 Vehicle is silky smooth in performance, quiet at high speeds, nimble in handling.



 Turning radius very tight despite room in front/back/cargo areas.



 Styling to me exceeds others in class.
Interior is well laid out; controls are intuitive and easily reached.


 Driving a flat 30 miles home from dealership at 55 mph in eco mode, instantaneous mileage dropped below 30 mpg only twice.
Me likee.



 Don't think Honda engineers could balance all elements of form and function better than they did.





 I am retired and no Honda fanboy, but vehicle is exceptional.

Bought this CRV in Jan 2013.
Have about a thousand miles on it.
Power is nicely responsive for a 4 cyl.
Steering and Road/Ride Quality is sweet! Bluetooth works great with my iPhone 4s.
Radio & Phone steering wheel controls are nice. If I had a main gripe its the comfort of seats and the whole Steering wheel/Arm Rest Combo.
I'm 5'10" & 220 lbs and seats are a bit small for me(width-wise). Steering wheel doesn't telescope nor move down enough towards driver.
On hghwy trips I'm unable to drive as casually as I would like whereas my wrist is on my lap and holding steering at 5-7 o'clock..and thats with my seat ratcheted up most of the way.
Armrests are too narrow and unsupportive.
