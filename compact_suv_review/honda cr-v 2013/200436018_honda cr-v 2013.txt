I purchased
from a dealer with whom I had over 30 good years of experience with Volvos.
 As I thought their service was excellent and they were very close, I purchased the car albeit via a high pressure salesman.

The CR-V get's better millage in average driving than my old 2000 RAV4 did on the highway. It is also quieter, bigger, more comfortable and more powerful.

The OEM radio has very poor AM sound.
Being formerly heavily involved in auto radio design.
I measured the power, and found it to to be 40 Watts, not 160.

Complaints got nothing but lies.
They even refused to put their reply in writing, only verbally via telephone.
The refused to reveal how they arrive at 160 Watts.

Just bought one today, less than 30 miles, computer reports 21.1mpg mostly highway driving with ECON button on. Maybe needs to be calibrated. I absolutely hate sunroofs and didn't want the more overpriced EX. My previous honda SUV was EX and it had both armrests in the front. This one doesn't have it on passenger side. What bothers me is driver's side armrest. Compared to EX its positioned higher, which makes driving very uncomfortable. The left arm can't reach the door arm rest and the right side is too high. When i tried the EX after i already paid for LX, EX seems to have both the door and right side arm rest at the same lever so i can rest both arms and still hold the steering wheel

After much research, im a CRV Owner. Gas mileage in town is 27 Avg. Gas mileage on 2000 mile trip from Michigan to Alabama and back 29mpg. Econ mode on whole time.
MPG AVG 28.7.
Very Comfortable seats.
Lots of leg and storage room for all passengers.
Rear seats recline, love it. Low interior noise.
Very High reliability.
 Blue tooth works great, and reads my text messages to me.
I love the plastic stays nice longer.
Its soft where it needs to be. I did significant research on 2013 CRV and 2013 Rav, I went with CRV.
For 2013 CRV LX AWD Paid 24000 plus tax and plate.
 American Made in Ohio is a plus.
Im pretty picky and hard to please, im extremely happy with my CRV.

I took delivery of a CRV LX and noticed when I got home that the tires were substandard....Continental.
This LX was not on the lot at anytime only other CRV's but not LX's.
The other CRV's had Michelin's or Goodyear tires so I assumed..

The dealer and Honda America were not interested in trading out the tires even if I paid the difference which is amazing to me.

I have owned my 2013 for 3 weeks.
I love the interior.
It's roomy and well designed and the back seats fold down easy for hauling.
 I'm doing mostly in town driving and getting a solid 22 miles/gallon.
The seats I would give this car 5 stars except that it recently started making a rattle noise when shifting between 1st and 2nd gear.
Dealer says it's normal.
Sometimes power is an issue when needing to surge onto the interstate.
