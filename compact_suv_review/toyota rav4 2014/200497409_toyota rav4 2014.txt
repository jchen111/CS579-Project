1500 miles and three weeks since purchase.
Black with Terra Cotta - I like the interior colors versus all black.
Just finished a road trip. Milage since purchase 26.8 - estimate highway at close to published 29.
It is not a race car but I knew that. Wanted the range of milage we are getting. Enjoy the wide storage in the rear. Better than competition.
Front seat comfort is good - visibility is good using mirrors. Interior style is appealing. 
Challenges - none of which would change my decision. No Homelink - even in Limited trim. Didn't realize and would like. No rain sensing wipers - spoiled with this on another vehicle - and had a very rainy road trip.

I got the top trim level and added remote start, homelink, and a trailer hitch.
Remote start and heated seats are great on those chilly, Midwest mornings.
I am a conservative driver, having traded in a 2008 Prius, and I am routinely getting between 32-33 mpg on the hwy, and about 27-28 in city driving in Eco mode.
This vehicle is fun to drive, and dollar for dollar is the best deal on the market.
I test drove the Honda CRV, Subaru Forester and Crosstrek, and the Mazda CX-5, and none could compare pricepoint and features.
Reliability and comfort have been fantastic!!

The Rav 4 is a responsive, small SUV and well appointed. The auto liftgate is handy and all the features you might want are available in the Limited. HOWEVER, if you have an I-Phone 4, you will not be able to load the contacts from your phone on to the bluetooth system! Wish they had told us that the contacts would load on the base models, but NOT their top of the line model. If this is important to you, and it should be, look elsewhere.
