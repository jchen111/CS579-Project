I am an active older woman, and my husband and I wanted
to buy a vehicle with
some luxury touches, a higher seating position and a quiet interior.
I kept looking at the Encore and being put off by reviews saying that the engine is too small, itÂs slow etc. But when I actually test drove an Encore Leather, I was hooked.
No problems merging on to the highway or driving on hills. The turbocharged engine managed just fine.
Have driven
it
for 3 mths mostly in town with a few trips on the highway, and one
in Rocky Mountain Nat. Pk.
There, the car purred quietly up and down the snowy and sometimes slippery mountain roads and I could easily control the downhill speed in the Manual range.
