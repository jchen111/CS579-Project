We have had our 2014 Forester for a year now and still love it. My wife hated the styling of all Subarus and refused to even test drive one until I tricked her into looking at the new Forester by telling her it was a Mitsubishi. She was pleased with the styling, amazed by how easy it was to drive (it's like driving an awd glass bubble with the turning radius of a jeep) and completely shocked when I informed her that she was in a Subaru. It has performed wonderfully even in the 10 inch snows we got repeatedly last winter and has been a joy to own. On top of that I frequently break 40mpg on trips and overall average 34mpg with 50/50 highway city driving.

Drive Car West Coast , Canada. Great car in Snow/Ice. SAFETY....Only SUV that passes the off-set Crash test...and
that alone is enough to buy this car after my recent ( non fault) Subaru write off crash.
Great Mileage! I get 32 us mpg on highway(over Mountain passes) and 34 us mpg on flat highways ; 25 us mpg in City...so I don't know why the Lead foot drivers complain of "poor" mileage.I had a CRV & Nissan and this car is
superior....and I would buy this SUV again and again.

It's really hard to review this car without context of having driven its competitors.
To me it's a very nice vehicle but I'm not sure how it stacks up against other CUVs.
I'll try to address the major topics.
After 3900 miles it doesn't burn oil. MPG as advertised but drops with ambient temperature and speed over 65 mph.
I can drive a long way without getting lower back pain so I consider this comfortable.
Adequate storage where I can put a coffee in the center holder and water in the door (32 oz!).
Storage under cargo area for ratchet straps and wife's purse. Disappointed with stiff ride at first but used to it now. Radio data system intuitive and sound quality adequate.

Ok. we do drive a lot of miles(33,000) in 1 year. We have car serviced every 5000 miles at our local Subaru dealer with Subaru products. Each time of service I buy 2 extra quarts of oil this will keep it full until next service.I have complained they(dealer) tell me it's normal consumption.No leaks. It does drive and ride well just a pain to keep up with the engine oil.We bought this car brand new and we don't abuse it.This is info for anyone thinking of buying the 14 forester 2.5.We buy a new car every 3 years not sure if we'll buy another Subaru.

I have almost 4000 miles on my Forester Limited and from the day I brought it home the dashboard rattles and vibrates. I thought it was related to cold weather, but as the weather warms up it rattles worse. I have taken it into the dealership three times already and they tinker, pad and tighten with no improvement. I want to love this vehicle but it has eaten up and continues to eat up time and money in that I have to take off work and take it back to the dealer, only to have no improvement. The rattle seems to move but mainly in the vent or inside the odometer or MFD. Seems to be the whole dash. I am very disappointed. High rpms when accelerating, cheap carpet. Touchy gas pedal.

First week - The truck seems excellent.

Purchased in October. Was getting 29 mpg on average. The cold weather began in mid December and mileage waned. Now January, Polar Vortex in PA, and the mileage is down to no better than 21. Takes quite a while to warm up...that's ok, I have heated seats.
Defrost is ok, but it is just fogged windows I have to cope with - not the frost many of you spoke of. But I turn on the defrost or the heater and in auto, the air conditioner compressor is engaged to regulate the set temp. Can't turn it off. RPM goes up 500. OAT is 8 degrees. Don't need AC, just bring in outside air. Not smart engineering there. Is it because of the CVT, Mr. Engineer? Love the car otherwise.

Have owned this Subaru (my first) for just three months and am baffled by all the wonderful reviews. The gas mileage is nowhere near what was advertised. Its ride is rough and bumpy on anything other than totally smooth roads. The car has so many interior rattles and clunking noises that it's impossible to enjoy a quiet drive through the countryside. Today, with typical cold winter temps, my driver's side door didn't open easily, the windshield wipers were still totally frozen after the defroster was running for a full 20 minutes and none of the power windows would open, even after another 20 minutes of driving with the heat at full blast. Am I supposed to wait until April for them to open?

My 3rd Subaru, but first Forester. Never bought before because it was too small.
 I am 6' tall, not huge, but this is the first Forester model I feel comfortable both in front and back.
My teenage boys are very comfy in the backseat, and they are my height.


My only complaint is the gas mileage.
I get 20-21 mpg when the local EPA MPG is 24.
That's a big difference, and I am not driving like a leadfoot !
I ease off on gas and coast to stop signs and red lights, and that's the only way I got close to 21mpg.
 My much larger outback gets about 19-20 locally, so only a 1 mpg improvement with a smaller Subaru.

On 1 November 2013, I purchased the 2014 Subaru Forester 2.5i Limited. I traded in a 2014 Honda Accord EXL. The purchase was made at Vic Bailey Imports, Spartanburg, SC. The trade was made in order to move to a vehicle with the CVT transmission, to acquire a more comfortable ride
and get a higher passenger seat for my wife, better gas mileage and standard all wheel drive. The Forester provides all these attributes. I added the following options: auto dim mirror compass, body side molding, rear bumper cover and splash guards. It is the perfect vehicle for us and as it turns out, it is the Motor Trend 2014 SUV of the Year. Subaru got it right!
