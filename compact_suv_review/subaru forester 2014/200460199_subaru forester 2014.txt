I am writing this because I read reviews like this for 2 months before I purchased my 2014 Forester XT. Day one the car was delivered with screw in the tire, tire had to be ordered. Week 2 Stress crack in windshield. Long cranks or multiple cranks to start car. Shim was inserted by Subaru. Car now misfires with no solution available. The last time at the Bob Moore Subaru I was told to come pick up my car, because we can't repair it. Subaru wanted me to pay $4500 more to exchange the car for an identical model. Serious problems with this model!!

I bought this car on 3/21/14 after a lot of research and I am little bit disappointed. The ride is annoying what I mean by this is when you drive on an intelligent mode, you feel every bump or uneven surfaces. When you start the car, engine shakes so does my left feet. I have a back problem and this is not good for my back. Seat is not big for comfort. I hope I better get use to this or I might have to sell this car. Driving in "S" mode is ok but uses lot of gas. I might have to do second review after 5k miles...still confused about this car. Please rent this car for 1 week and then buy. I highly recommend.

The 2014 Subaru 2.0 XT Forester Premium is one of the best fuel saving ,fast running,nice styling, All Wheel Drive and most comfortable SUV that I have ever owned. It's 250 HP BOXER ENGINE is quiet and powerful, from the on ramp to the fast lane the 2.0 XT Premium is outstanding. It's CVT Transmission is very smooth and before you realize it you are running at 80 plus MPH. It's wide windows and wide review mirrors helps you merge safely.

I will come back to update in a few months but I wanted to get my initial ownership impressions out there.


Pros:
Engine/Turbo - makes a car this large really fun to drive
Transmission - High torque CVT with SI modes is best CVT I've driven.
Not as fun as VW/Audi's dual clutch DSG, but still very good.
Interior Room/Space - Car feels much bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside.

Exterior Styling - I've had three unrelated people tell me that the car's profile reminds them of a Porsche Cayenne - I'll take it!
 

Cons:
Sunroof: Rattles like crazy when open and doesn't have a tilt function.
Seats: Not uncomfortable but not good either, even with the sport side bolsters
