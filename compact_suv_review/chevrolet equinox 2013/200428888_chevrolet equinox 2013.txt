Chevy sold me a car with a known & unresolved problem with the torque converter clutch.
Not mentioned before the sale or the sale would not have occurred.
I won't go into all the drama, but Chevy and the dealer sold a new car that needs the transmission dropped and would not replace a chipped chrome wheel, valued at over $700, that I did not cause. I have since traded this very poor example of Chevy quality, and yes, I took a real beating on the trade.
