I've had my Equinox for over a year now and here are my pros and cons.
Pros:
-I haven't gotten stuck once during the first winter season with my all seasons. I can't wait to drive it with winter tires.
-I like the sliding backseat feature. My parents won't ride shotgun because they like the room in the back!
-Fairly good on gas and very decent on the highways when on eco mode
-Smooth ride, especially on highways
-Blind spot mirrors are very helpful

Cons:
-Wish the backseats would fold flat, it gives it a weird angle when folded.
-Very narrow space from behind
-Some of the interior gives it a cheap look and easily scratches and dents from normal wear
-Steering is sluggish

This is my second chevy that I've owned. My first was totalled in a hail storm and then I chose a nissan which I hated, then a mazda, and now back to chevy with my first SUV. I have to say that I absolutely LOVE this car. There is alot to be said about an american made car vs. a foreign one. I was debating between the Huyandi Tucson and the Equinox. For me, the only thing Hyuandi has over Chevy is their long warranty, once I shut the door in the chevy, I was sold.

Overall the vehicle is not too bad.
The tire road noise is terrible.
On the coarser paved roads the noise is very noisey and distractive.
The vehicle is equipped with Michelin Latitude Tour tires that are also terrible in the snow.
I will be looking for new tires if that doesn't remedy the problem, a new vehicle
