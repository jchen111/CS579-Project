This review is for a V6 AWD 2LT with leather (apparently Edmunds doesn't give us the option to rate a V6 model). After 16,000 miles, this has been an excellent vehicle. You'll likely be happy with it as long as you have the right expectations. The Equinox is not designed to be a sporty SUV. It's a solid, comfortable, roomy, un-pretentious, completely reliable SUV with excellent highway manners, good technology, and good value. Remember, the Equinox is built on the same platform with the same V-6 as the Cadillac SRX, only de-contented and de-tuned (and much cheaper). A new Equinox will be released in a year or so, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy this model again.

I was a Saturn owner since 1994.
Changing brands was nerve wracking! I was nervous about buying the Equinox because of the reviews complaining about blind spots.
I haven't had any problems in that regard & I'm enjoying the heck out of this vehicle.
I don't but a lot of miles on a car so after 6 months I only have 3500 miles on the car.
Gas mileage is just about as advertised - 23/29.
I get about 22 around town & the best I've gotten on the highway is 30.2.
The 4 cyl has been fine, but it can be a little sluggish when accelerating.
Not enough to discourage me though.

I went to the dealership wanting a Traverse and left with this car instead.
I love my new car and I look forward to the savings on gas milage.
The eco button is awesome and the hands free calling are just a few of the things I like about this car.
The leg room for the second row is awesome.
I couldn't believe how much space is back there.
Even though it doesn't have a third row, the space is great for me and my family of 4.

 Picked up the 2LT 4cyl in white diamond w/light titanium leather interior and the 18" upgrade chrome wheels and man it does look sharp! I bought it for my fiance' for Bday/Xmas and I think i'm happier than she is.

First thing is it does get 33 mpg I saw it I calculated it and the onboard computer saved it too...achieved on the NJ Turnpike driving 65 mph, i'm sure if you take it to 70+ it drops way off but it will achieve the mileage they claim on the highway.
 Second is the light titanium leather interior...very nice! It has been a focal point of everyone that's looked at it. My Toyota fan club neighbor came walking by and I opened the door and his eyes popped out his skull..literally..

I bought a 2013 6 cylinder AWD 2LT Equinox with leather as a winter/extra vehicle to keep miles off my more expensive cars. I didn't expect a Chevy to be this comfortable, well designed, and almost "elegant" inside. I cross shopped a 2013 Escape SEL, which is sportier but lost points in every other category. The Chevy won with roomier interior, huge backseat room, more comfortable seats, better organized dash, intuitive controls, 301 hp V-6 for the price of a Ford 4 cyl, more refined drive train, quieter ride, classier interior. The Escape had a disjointed "chaotic" non-intuitive dash and controls, uncomfortable back seat with tight leg room, narrow front seats, awkward driving position.
