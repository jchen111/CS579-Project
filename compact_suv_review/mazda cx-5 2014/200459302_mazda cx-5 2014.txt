Had my CX-5 for 5 days.
Love the drive, love the styling, love the gas mileage.
Hate, hate, hate the locking system.
Are you kidding me with this maybe the lift gate will lock and maybe it
won't.
How would you know.
You have to walk away and when you come back with your key it is always open.
What the heck is the purpose of the black button anyway.
Are we supposed to depend that this locking sensor is going to work indefinitely.
How do we know when it stops working.
Not light, no beep not indicator, no nothing.
Worse design I have ever seen.
I am 66.
I have owned a lot of cars.
I would not have purchased this one had I known.
Will try to get a lock installed

Purchased : December 2013

Build quality may be an issue...

Week 2 : the passenger seat trim vibrating noise, probably due to contact when exiting vehicle.
Fixed by dealer.

Week 3 : front windows vibrating noise when opened slightly.
Not bothersome enough to take to dealer, but disappointing nonetheless.

Week 4 : right sun visor vibration noise, goes away if opened then reclosed.

Week 6 : upper right corner of center console screen intermittent rubbing noise.

Since the beginning, there's also been a ceiling vibration noise if only the rear windows are open.
Apparently, this kind of wind harmonics problem is common for many cars.
Again, more disappointment.

I bought my 2014 Mazda CX-5 Touring back in May of 2013.
I used to be a Dodge guy all the way, but my best friend, who runs a Mazda dealership, introduced me to this ride.
I am a heavy commuter, 100 miles a day, and have already put 20,000 miles on it.
I have not had one single problem and have had great gas mileage.
It is a fun to drive car and a safe ride for me, my wife, and our 14 month old son.
Decent cargo room, and the 2014 has that 2.5 liter engine, giving it a boost over the 2.0 from 2013.
I'm looking forward to Mazda's reliability to get me through years of commuting, because I do A LOT of driving.
I highly reccommend!

After test driving all of the competitors (Ford, Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Subaru, Hyundai), I settled on
a 2014 CX-5 Touring to replace a 2001 VW Jetta Wagon. I was tempted by the Sport model, but the larger engine in the Touring and GT is much peppier for passing. I've had the vehicle now for about 3 months and do not regret my decision. The performance is more than adequate, handling is pretty good and gas mileage has been better than my VW and more than acceptable. I drive long distances a couple of times a week and have enjoyed the cruise control. Overall, it's a solid and fun care to drive, with plenty of room for hauling kids, gear, etc. Perfect for a small family.

1st 1000KM lots of problem encounter. hard start @ extreme cold weather (-20C), Engine Light alarm ON; high fuel consumption 10.5/100-mostly
hwy not 7.6/100 city-specs; engine nice accelerations 2.5L engine
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After falling in love with the CX5 and really enjoying it, some warts really started to show.
My commute changed from 55mi a day, 70% hwy to 40mi mostly city and my MPG really crashed.
Was getting 30+ mpg per tank, after moving I never saw 20 mpg again. Then there's the wear on the interior - the seats in my 2004 Honda with 170k looked better than the CX5's after less than 6 months.
The drivers seat looked beat after 8k miles and stray threads were popping up in the pass seat.
The carpet in the rear hatch was trashed after I moved bags and boxes, I hauled tons of stuff in my Honda and it looked better, can't imagine how bad the CX5 will look in 5 years, brutal.
Got a great Subaru trade.

Firstly, heart felt thanks to all the other reviewers for their reviews in helping in my car purchase process. Had to make a decision between the CX5 vs Forester and went with the CX5. So far so good. Car makes engine noise when just started and also on windy conditions, you can hear the wind noise inside the car. Drives real smooth around corners and in city conditions. For me the lack of reclining back seats
nor enough rear leg room for adults was not a deal breaker. Forester has better reliability and AWD as standard. CX5 Bose/Tech package is amazing especially the night adaptive halogen headlights. If you drive around poorly lit areas, this will make a ton of difference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have driven the CX5 for just a week now and I am impressed at the power in the 2.5 liter
4 cylinder engine. Great pickup and can do anything I ask it to do on the road. Ride is firm but comfortable, the steering is responsive, the 9 speaker Bose system sounds great and it much better than on my old Mazda 626 ES. The mileage so far as I have recorded is hanging around 28 MPG. Wonderful. The rear camera and the BSM system are all frosting on the cake. I purchase additional warranty to
84 mo/100,000 miles , beyond Mazda's 36 mo/36,000 mile

I just bought a CX-5 Touring with the bose/moonroof upgrade and love it!
I spent months researching and couldn't seem to find a crossover that had everything on my wishlist and still managed to have good gas mileage.
It was love at first sight when I found this car!
If I had to be picky, I would love to get a little more bass from the car stereo, and the seats could be just a little bit more comfortable but this car really is the total package at an affordable price.

I wanted to get the wife in a larger and higher vehicle due to crazy traffic in Dallas,TX(drives a civic). I was very impressed with how much it drives like a car in that there is virtually no body lean. We wanted a SUV that you could get good amenities without having leather and this was it. The acceleration is very good when you want to speed up to get around someone. My wife initially liked the CRV more as you can see better out of it but you need to drive the car for the day and get used to the blindspot mirrors and once she was used to them it was hands down a much better driving experience than the CRV. I felt that in a year or so the CRV would be ho-hum compared to the CX5.
