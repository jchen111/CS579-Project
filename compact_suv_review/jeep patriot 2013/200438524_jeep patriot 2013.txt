Our '03 Jeep Liberty was starting to rack up some repairs and then the real kicker was the 12 mpg continual run to the pump. A new car was easier on the budget. I still wanted a small 4wd C/SUV, but with excellent gas mileage. Looking to a balance my need for good cargo space, ability to carry a fair amount of weight and still be economical, I test drove every one of the Asian built tennis shoe/used soap bar shaped AWD vehicles - especially after reading the reviews of the Jeep Patriot/Compass.
I did not even bother with test driving this vehicle. Only the Mazda CX5 came close ($$$ and lack of cargo weight).
Finally the Patriot - the reviews are wrong!
It rocks!
It is a dream to drive.
