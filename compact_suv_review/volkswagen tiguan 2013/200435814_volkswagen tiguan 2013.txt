Just got the '13 Tiguan S w/panoramic sunroof & mat kit for my wife and we love this car. Small CUV that handles like a sport sedan with all tried and true German automotive attributes: sophisticated & understated interior and exterior styling, satisfying performance & handling and rock solid build. 

After driving both the S and SE, the S is already so well equipped incl. leather wrapped multi-function steering wheel, MFD display, bluetooth etc. that we couldn't justify the extra $5k or so for leatherette and lower profile tires. Great ride, great family car, excellent lease deals to be had.

I test drove the 2012 model tiguan and felt the weird gear shifts. 2013 model does not have it. No vibrations, rumbling or what so ever in any speed.

The panaromic sunroof is gorgeous. Driving is very fun and feels very safe. I can take winding roads with 50 on hwy when the reccomendation is 30. Grips the road and asks more.

Bluetooth is avrcp 1.3 tho, which does not work with iPhone's 1.4 avrcp (ios6) so I can not skip tracks (I can still listen tho)

Interior build quality is very good. Interior looks very cool especially at night, all the red lights inside definitely adds some elegance.

gas milage is not so great tho, I get 22. Its been a month may be will get better...
