This car doesn't compare to a RAV4! My wife and I traded our 2010 Rav4 for this, thinking there wouldn't be much of a change, but I was wrong. I am a tall guy, I fitted just fine in our Rav4, but I noticed it was tighter in the Rouge at the test drive. The wife like the price of the Rouge and how we were able to get all the options for the same price of a new Rav4. I listened to wife and bought this for her and it's been a mistake ever since. It doesn't turn like our old car, blind spots all over, CTV transmission is noisy. You think it's going to break down every time you step on the gas. I ain't one to make up an account to talk about a car, but people need to be warned! Stay away!

Pros:
1. CV Tranny excellent, no constant shifting
2. Plenty of power when needed at any speed.
3. Drives comfortably, but shorter
wheelbase of this class is a little bumpier.
4. I get 28 mpg, my wife gets 24 overall. Gets over 30 on the highway at 60 mph.
5. Door looking options are very nice.

Cons:
1. The Navigation system is totally useless. I had to buy a GPS. Cannot be set while moving, no MPH check, No useful trip record, no elevation, etc. etc. Of no use whatsoever.
2. No option for power seats for passenger.
3. Cargo space is small for class.
4. Speedometer is analog only, no digital read.

I traded in a 2010 Chrysler T&C loaded because the 3.8L V-6 was just too gas hungry 18-19 mpg.
I got tired of it after the new wore off. My wife and I have owned 2 Nissan Sentras and we have liked Nissan products. I decided to try the Rogue and I am very happy with my choice, however, I was going to buy a 2013 Sentra but they all had Black interiors. I could not find one with a light interior. In Texas when the temp is 100 degrees you don't want to be setting in a black car. I purchased a "Frosted" Rogue SL loaded and I love driving it. 25 mpg and I haven't been on any road trips yet. It will do better on "Cruise". The Nissan Rogue will make a nice traveling SUV.
