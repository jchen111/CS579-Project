I purchased a new 2013 Rogue in May 2013. Last week, the malfunction light came on in the car.
After experiencing difficulty accelerating while driving in town, I took the car to the nearest Nissan dealer.
Eventually, it was determined that I needed a new transmission.
The car had less than 5,000 miles!
It has been 8 days and the car is still being repaired. I will never purchase another Nissan again.
Clearly, there was a defect in the manufacturing process.
