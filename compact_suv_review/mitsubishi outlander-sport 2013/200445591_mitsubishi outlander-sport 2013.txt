I only had 2 concerns requirements for a new car, higher seating position and descent MPG.
With those requirements I completely expected the performance would not impress.
The Outlander Sport certainly delivers on that expectation.
Very unimpressive. 
The MPG rating of 28Hwy, 24 city, 26 combined is just a pipe dream.
I am averaging 22 MPG and my 100 mile round trip commute is 90% wide open interstate (no traffic to content with).
I always watch to make sure the 'ECO' indicator is lit and still only 22MPG.
Took the car to the dealer.
They 'checked it out', test drove it (with same results as my experience) and called Mitsubishi Tech.
Their answer, "Yup, that's what you can expect"
