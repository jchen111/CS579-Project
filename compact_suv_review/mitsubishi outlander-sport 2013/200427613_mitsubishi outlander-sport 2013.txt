Im on my 4th Mitsubishi and I always go to Westboro Mitsubishi in Westboro Mass.
I am on my 3rd leased car from them an Outlander Sport SUV 2013 and I love it.
The car drives great and handles great in all weather.
The Sales and service staff are great and bend over backwards for you.
I would definately reccomend this car and this dealership.
