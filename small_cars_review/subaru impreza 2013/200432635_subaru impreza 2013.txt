Car was purchased new in 2012.
I want to warm consumers that th body is of cheap quality.
Just looking at it give it a "dent".
The body it like tin foil.

The worst is the car is built very low to the ground at 5.6".
Small road "bumps" or driving up a steep hill damages under the bumper. Also underneath the front and back bumper damages when parking over curbs.


The back wheel guard is even lower to the ground & "hook shape".
My car caught on a low curb and bumper partially pulled off.
My car is only 1y/o but the body is getting beaten.
This is my 6th car and by far it has the worst quality body design.

Was very surprised at the performance and handling of the car. Great fun to drive on curvy roads even with the CVT (and I say that as a former Porsche owner).

The hatchback model has very good use of space. Can carry a lot of cargo for trips. The hatchback also has good visibility, with no major blind spots. 

But a couple complaints: The side mirrors are flimsy plastic POS. After 6 months of ownership, fallen off 3 times, broke the last time. As other mentioned, the audio system is horrible. The paint scratches very easily. The car sits too low to the ground, keep scraping the bumper on driveways.
