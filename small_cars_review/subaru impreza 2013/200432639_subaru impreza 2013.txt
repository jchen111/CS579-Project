I've had my first Subaru now for over 22,000 miles. After many years on the west coast, I was not used to the level of snow I experience here in Minnesota, and so when it was time for a new car on a budget I found myself choosing between this Subaru (AWD for the weather, decent MPG, bare bones for the rest) and a Nissan Altima (fun to drive, good creature comforts, same weather limitations as my previous Sentra).

After over a year of ownership, I'd have to say I got what I expected to get: in city and highway driving in the snow, this is a vast improvement over the sedan I was driving, with reasonable MPG. The interiour is roomy but basic, the creature comforts are poor.

This car has been nothing but a problem.
It has a terrible ride, gets poor gas mileage and at 24,400 miles chewed a set of tires right off the car.
Subaru has to pay to put a new set on becuse it was under warranty.
It has been aligned four time, it has had the steering box adjusted and now the AWD disengages in any slippery condition.
Subaru is aware of how this car is running particulary with the AWD malfunctions, but Subaru engineering insists that the car is running to specifications.
It is a piece of junk and the worst car purchase I have ever made.
I have heard of many problems with the 2013's so buyer beware on this model year they are defective.

Overall the car is fine. I really like the interior and the way it handles on flat roads and downhill in the mountains. It's light and fun to drive in these conditions and feels very stable. 

Downside: It's more underpowered than I expected--even hilly neighborhoods have the engine revving high and loud. AC seems to increase the problem. The nav system is not
intuitive--my cell phone app is more user friendly. Speakers are tinny and HD radio is not useful because it keeps fading out--unsure if the problem is the car or HD radio in general. Biggest problem is MPG--have yet to break 25 MPG with 60+% highway driving. Trip computer seems to overestimate actual by about 1.4 MPG.

I'm a 28 yr old male, combat arms in the Army, who is really into what I call "adventure time." So I wanted something that looked nice, got decent mpg, and could take me where ever I wanted to go. Enter my 2013 Impreza Sport Limited. A treat to myself with my money from the 'Stan. My ol' lady likes to tease me and say it is a station wagon, but meh, I LOVE it. My only two gripes: with the A/C on, it accelerates like a granny on a scooter; and even after almost 11,000 miles I'm still getting only 26 mpg mixed driving. I by no means drive like an old person, but I don't have a lead foot either... so I'm a little disappointed in that. Other than that, I'm a fan for life.

I consider Bluetooth a safety feature. This Bluetooth does not synchronize with the phone's contact list. You need to manually enter each contact. For each, you need to manually enter the phone number by scrolling a thumb wheel for each number, and then you say the name. When I said "Larry" it told me I had to have 2 syllables. When I said "Drywall John" it said it was too similar to "Larry Cell"! You cannot input the name, so for a list of phone numbers, you get numbers but no associated names. It would not recognize my wife's voice since it only knew my voice. When we renamed contacts using my wife's voice, it would no longer recognize my voice. This system is an embarrassment to Subaru.

it's hard for me to tell at this point the reliability since i've only had it for a couple days but so far so great! i was contemplating between the new vw beetle and golf, both test driven but when it came down to it, i went with the impreza and i'm so happy i did.
although the interior is not as aesthetic and lacks some of the bells and whistles that vw has, i still was able to get everything i wanted and more, such as heated seats, leather, moon roof, bluetooth, upgraded sound system (crazy good for coming from the factory, not stock), etc. i feel like for what i paid, i got the best bang for my buck.
i feel like subaru's reputation for reliability and safety was really what got me.
