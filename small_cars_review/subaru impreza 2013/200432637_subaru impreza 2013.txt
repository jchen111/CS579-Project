We bought this for for the following reason and so far it has been great at it.

- Traction in the snow
- Fuel economy
- Cargo space
- Safety rating
- Reliability

A lot of people seem to have reliability with the car, so far I've had no problem, I hope it will stay that way.


It prowess in the snow even exceeded my expectation.
With a set of Michelin winter tires, it feel like driving in the summer.

I bought my CVT premium hatchback in December.
This is my 4th Subaru impreza but first new car.
The best thing about it is the mileage.
At first my average MPG seemed low but then I started looking at the instantaneous MPG readout and adjusting my driving style to maximise fuel efficiency.
Now at around 5,000 miles I am getting almost EXACTLY the MPG estimated by Subaru, 28 around town, 30 mixed and 36 highway (actually I did get 38 a few time on a long 100 mile drive).


The other great thing is the leg room in the rear.
I had to drive a rental Ford Fous for a week and my son complained that he had LESS room in the back than in the Subau.
Not sure he's right...but still.

I have moved from a Honda Civic to the 2013 Impreza.
Car drives much better than the Civic, about the same gas mileage with a lot less road noise.
Seats are better than the Civic, most of the interior is on par or better.

My first Subaru, picked up a few weeks ago after laborous research, test drives, and deliberations.

Could not be happier with my purchase. No car is absolutely perfect, but this car meet every one of my criteria at or beyond expectations.

It is comfortable, practical, fun to drive, and as versatile as any car I have owned.
I use it as a city car and it takes pot holes like a champ, manuevers perfectly, feel safe and comfortable, and squeezes into those tough spots a full size just cant.
I love my Subaru and the Impreza wont win any contests on looks alone, but is really the most practical and well rounded car I can find.
