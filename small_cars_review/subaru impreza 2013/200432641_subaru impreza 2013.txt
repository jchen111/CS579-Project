Bought the car in September of 2013. I was looking at several but decided on this as I couldn't afford the gas bill for the premium fuel only WRX and this car still had the famous Subaru AWD but also boasted very good gas mileage. 

So far at 6000 miles with largely conservative highway driving I am getting worse mileage than my girlfriend's 250hp BMW. Worse mileage. It feels under-powered even for a 148hp car (the dealer says "it will really open up at 10000mi" lol) and the AWD has not been as advertised. I've gotten stuck and had to be pulled out three times on a dirt road that my old sports car did not have trouble with.

This car is so close .. but fails.

After having the car for awhile its not as good as my impressions of when I bought it from the dealership.
 But it is a very good price AWD car.
Buying a Subaru was a different experience. I found out that you will get a substantial better price from a large volume dealer than smaller one. This is how Subaru distrubution model works and the Impreza is a hot car. Our order took 6 months instead of the 12 weeks we were told, but we kind of knew this going in.

Traded up from a POS 98 Explorer. Overall, I am pleased with the car. AWD provides great grip. I've yet to hear a tire squeal. Speaking of which, these stock tires are awful. Tons of noise. CVT takes some getting used to. I don't like the delays between drive and reverse. Get the upgraded speakers, worth it. I do wish there were more storage places & hidden cubbies. Sound insulation isn't great, but this isn't a luxury vehicle. Decent MPG if you treat it right. Getting around 34, 70% hwy. The MPG gauge is a little optimistic by a few MPG's. Bluetooth kind of sucks, but its fine for calls. AWD, MPG, visibility and good dynamics makes me a happy owner. Great car for the money.

 I wanted a AWD vehicle that got decent MPG. My 1st impression when sitting in the car for the first time was WOW! you can see everything from the front, back & all sides. The leg room was better than the Mazda Tribute that I was driving and the seat in the Subaru is awesomely comfortable! Loved it from the get go. I'm up to 6,000 miles and the MPG combine city/highway is now at 30 MPGs steadily for the last few weeks, it was in the low 20 MPGs for a few thousand miles. I legally tinted all windows except windshield and added the bug shield, aero splash guards and side window deflectors and the car looks hot! I'm very happy so far

The Bluetooth is a joke.
Subaru should be embarrassed to have such terrible software in a 2013 model.
You cannot upload your phonebook, the controls suck, and its voice recognition barely works right.
It constantly makes errors and give you the wrong number.
The sales staff at the dealer knew all about the problems and told me a bunch of crap that weren't total lies so they could avoid telling me the truth about the system.
It makes Subaru look bad.
Other than that, the car is great, but its a big disappointment that this flaw exists and that they try to hide it and don't fix it ASAP.

We have had the Impreza Sport Premium about three weeks now and I am impressed.
That is saying a lot after trading in my 2008 Infiniti M35.
I decided the Impreza is a more practical car for our needs (late 30s with boys).
Doubled our gas mileage.
Enough room in the rear seat for two car seats and my wife if she chooses to sit there.
Plenty of leg room.
Huge cargo volume with seats folded down.
Seat bottoms are longer than other cars for more leg support.
Other's shorten the seat to bump leg room numbers. Fun to drive especially with paddle shifters.
All wheel drive handling is fantastic, especially in the rain.
This is my first AWD car and I am hooked.
Very happy with my decision.
