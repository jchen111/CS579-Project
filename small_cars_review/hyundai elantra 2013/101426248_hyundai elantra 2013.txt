Sadly, my experience with my car since my last review has soured me on it. I originally purchased it in June of 2012. In the last year, I have experienced multiple issues which make me question the long-term reliability, quality and engineering of this car. My issue with intermittent rough idle continues unabated, whether using or not using the a/c. It is clearly not an engine load issue. As well, now the transmission has developed an absolutely maddening metallic clicking sound intermittently when accelerating from a stop, or a roll, and sometimes when letting off the throttle. There is also a tick in the engine when it hasn't fully warmed up. This car is a "good looker" with a black heart.

Hyundai is making defective vehicles that destroy tires.  They will not acknowledge the defect.  A few customers have been lucky and had their rear axles replaced at no cost, but most customers will just be told nothing is wrong and it must be the way they are driving or some other nonsense.  I have 40k miles and have gone through 3 sets of tires on the rear.  The set I have on now cupped badly within 5k miles and makes the car vibrate and very noisy.  Both the dealership and the company will not acknowledge or fix the problem.  

Do your research before you buy this car.  You will see there are many people having problems with rear tire wear/ handling/ noise/ rear axle problems.

I needed a good gas mileage low cost car to get to for work as my top priority. I got a little over what I wanted in payments, not bad but here is the worst part. It gets 19mpg on my commute and 17 if I am late and racing the car. Going back to the dealer they just point out on the sticker (I kept) that even though it says 30-40, in very small print by that it says 13-99mpg. Best vehicle rates 112 mpg's. Depends on how you drive. I just go to work and back! The cars do not come with spares & during my deal I was told they don't make them. So no offer was ever made to get me one. The next day I called back and they said they would sell me one.

My wife and I purchased our Elantra GLS in late June of 2012. So far the car has required nothing other than routine maintenance in the 8,200 miles we've driven it. Our main reason for purchasing this car was to obtain good fuel economy, and good value. It replaced a 2003 Honda Accord 4 cylinder that was burning a quart of oil every 700 miles with only 86,000 miles on it! The best I've seen using the cruise control on the highway (65 mph) is about 33 mpg, which is lower than we expected. In NYC traffic, the fuel economy has dipped to as low as 16 mpg. This is disappointing. Hyundai has promised to reimburse us for the fuel economy shortfall as has been widely reported.

 I traded in my 2007 Civic.
The Elantra so much more car for the money as I test drove a new Civic as well.

This is the third Hyundai I have owned and, to be honest, the one I like the least.
Outwardly it is a beautiful car.
I owned it less than two weeks when I had to have a new steering column installed.
I have owned the car since last July and find the suspension so loose that hitting a bump in the road causes the car to jump sideways.
At freeway speeds the car tends to drift somewhat. Noisy, as well. I don't feel I have as much control with this model.
It is very light and I don't feel I have a sturdy vehicle under me.
Additionally, the gas mileage is just about the same as my 2008.
Sorry I traded my 2008 Elantra for this new, (improved?) model.
 No more Hyundai's for me.

I have 2,780 miles on the car I boght in Oct./12. My mpg was between 24 and 32 since I bought the car until today when I got 38.1 mpg. I'm noticing that as the car breaks in, the mpg is getting higher and the performance is getting better. 
It's a little bumpy on uneven streets or highway, but I can overlook that aspect of the car because of the great price and features this car has. I took 3 weeks researching and nothing came close to the Elantra GLS in price and features. Great car!
I'll keep updating my reviews as time goes on.

Without a doubt the noisiest and hardest riding car I've ever owned. On complaint,I was told perhaps nitrogen filled tires may be unbalanced.
 Guess what? That was not the problem. I was told they could not duplicate the problem[s] and was signed off. I have 2400 miles and will trade in on another 'brand' ASAP!

Just purchased a 2013 Elantra Automatic, with the Preferred Package and Auto Dimming Mirror. I highly recommend both options.


 I do mostly mixed driving and my mpg is averaging in the low 30s with the eco button on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, this is a very good car. Your view of this car will vary depending on what type of vehicle you are coming out of.
You need to take a good test drive of the Elantra before making a final decision. The materials in the car are on level with an economy car but the styling overshadows some of the hard plastics. The fit and finish are on par with cars at least a class up. There is no other car that packs the value of the Elantra. As a package daily driver, you cannot go wrong with the Elantra GLS w/preferred pkg.
