After looking around at EVs for a second car (my commuter) we settled on either the LEAF or the Spark EV. Because the Spark EV retails for $5k less than the LEAF we ended up at the Chevy dealer in town. With the Federal incentive and our trade-in we got a lease for less than we spend on gas each month for my '07 Civic we traded in. What really sold me on the Spark was how much fun it is to drive. We got rid of our FJ because of rising gas costs and got a Prius, which is economical, but 'blah' to drive. No oomph, no giddy-up. The Spark blew my mind in terms of what it can do. It flies. No transmission changes and instant torque mean this thing can go. It's the most fun vehicle we've owned.

I leased the Spark EV in Feb 2014 and it's a secondary car and I travel about 30 miles roundtrip to and from work and this is on freeways mostly and I travel at about 70mph.
No issues getting up to speed in fact I often catch up to the cars in front.
I've come to really enjoy the quiet ride.
Once home I usually have about 58 miles of range left, I charge with a level 1 charger at 12amps which is fine for me.
I did get a Level 2 charger for free from Bosch but haven't used it yet.
I would recommend driving this vehicle in mixed driving and see how you like it.
Range will be impacted if you live or commute over a lot of hills.

Read the comparative C&D review of all electrics that rated Spark #1, then bought it 4 weeks ago, haven't driven our other cars since, it is a blast, fast, great handling, amazing interior space given tiny outside (I am 6-3). 85 miles range at 65, tried fast freeway trip at 75 to 80, range drops to 65 or so. Why doesn't Chevrolet push this car, it is excellent value with fed rebate, a modern day VW bug.
