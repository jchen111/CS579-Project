The front has a fully independent suspension, but rear has only a cheap beam in the back. And the rear bottoms out on bumps. 

Engine has no torque from A standstill when flooring the accelerator, almost had two accidents 

The gas economy is not 29/39. My trip computer at 15,841 miles, says only 17mpg
city and 26 on the highway. The only way this car could have ever gotten the epa estimated 29/39 is, in my opinion, with an anorexic, midget, driver and the only thing in the rest of the car including the trunk was a toothpick. lol.

The transmission was rebuilt after only 12,000 miles. The grinding noise continues which is the result of duel clutches.

Suspension: Front independent, but rear only a beam in the back - it bottoms out on bumps. NO torque from A standstill - almost got into two accidents when trying to accelerate from a standstill. The gas economy is not 29/39. My trip computer after 6000 miles, says I get only 17mpg in the city and 28 on the highway - UNACCEPTABLE for such a light car.
I challenge anyone from Ford to come and look at my trip computer. The rear seat is severely cramped. The rear windshield is harder to see out of at night. No center bin front seat.
When Arm rest extended, it interferes with cup holders. Ambient lighting is a waste of money. Front door has a weight imbalance. Blind spot mirrors hard to use.
