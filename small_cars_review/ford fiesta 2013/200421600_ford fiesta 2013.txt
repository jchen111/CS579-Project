I bought a 2013 fiesta in Jan 2013.
Automatic transmission.
Within 2 weeks the grinding noises began and had clutch replaced.
The grinding noises are starting again.
Got up yesterday morning to a pool of fluid under right side of engine on garage floor.
The car is not dependable, dealer tries to talk to me like I "just do not understand".
I am totally over this car.
I have no doubt I will meet the Lemon Law requirements by end of the year.
