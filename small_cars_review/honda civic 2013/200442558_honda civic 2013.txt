It took a few days to realize how uncomfortable the front seats are in this car. I tried to trade it back in, and was told I would take a $3k loss. They also wanted me to pay full sticker on the new car. I would not recomend Ocean Honda of New Port Richey(Florida). 
I chose this car for the reliability and mpg. If it wasn't for the seat, I would love this car.
