I had a 2007 CRV EX with leather, it had 111,00 miles on it and the extedned warrany was up.
My salesmen was in the service department I had ot leave the CRV overnight for a warranty repair. He called me the next day with a great deal and I could not pass it up at all. Its a 2013 Civic EXL brand new it was a
left over from the model year.

This is my fourth Civic and it is the most uncomfortable car I've ever owned. The headrest forces he to jut my head forward and the seat to curl my back. When I brake, no matter how gently, I and my passenger slide forward in the seats. I have long legs and the steering wheel will not telescope out far enough so I drive with your arms stretched out. Even though I have the EX-L with the power seat adjustments, I have yet to find a comfortable driving position. The seat is narrow and I am spilling over the side of it even though I am a size 6, I have to tighten my abs to stay in the seat around corners. On the plus side, the car is powerful, the handling is good, the mileage is excellent.

There are some issues that make this not a 5-star car (for me).

I purchased a new Civic EX-L in August 2013 after having driven a Mazda Tribute for 12 years.
I admit to it being a huge change and adjustment.
I have about 3,500 miles on it as of the date of this review.

My main complaint is how it drives in wet/snowy conditions.
It seems to have issues gripping the road, and even with just a dusting of snow on the road it spins it's tires when trying to move from a stopped position (no, I don't drive like Mario Andretti.)
 I have 30+ years experience driving in the snow and do not feel confident in this car's ability to navigate the roads during a midwest winter.

I've had the car for over a month now so I think I can write a fair review. I considered the Corolla, the Mazda 3, and Nissan Sentra and while I liked the colors available in all of those, I felt more comfortable driving a Civic. My old 2003 Civic was great and this is awesome! Bluetooth, spacious room for a 5'5 male. The car is just fun to drive and gives great MPG. It's quiet and climate control is great. I didn't like the wheels at first but I love the sporty look on them now. Trunk space is limited but spacious enough for groceries, sporting equipment, and the crap I carry around.
Dealer wanted to sell me multiple warranties, my response.."It's a Honda!" I know it will start in the a.m.

I like the car overall, but I'm still having a hard time getting past the cheap honeycomb grill & the too black alloy wheels. I didn't realize when I bought the car 3 weeks ago that the radiator is as visual as the grill itself. The interior noise/engine are improved & the overall handling is very good.
I wish I could get past the toys-for-us grill!
