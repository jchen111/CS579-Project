I leased the 2013 honda civic hybrid in this April, but since the purchase, I had my taken into the sealer's service department so many times on the brake and the forward collision alert, they said that nothing were wrong with the systems. But last month, warning lights came on related to the brakes and the IMA systems, then they had to fix them.
I felt a little light braking feeling after the repair, but today I found out that the initial stiff braking came back, I will have to take the car to the dealer again if its warning comes out soon. the other problem is that I will have to smash my car into any front running car to get a forward collision alert.
This is not a safe-guard measure
