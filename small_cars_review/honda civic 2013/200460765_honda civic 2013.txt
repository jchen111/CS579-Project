I recently bought my wife a 2013 civic hybrid for Mother's Day and we are really happy with this car. We've had several hondas so we new what to expect. 
This car is super quiet and the engine has more power than my previous civic hybrid. (I had a 08 civic hybrid ).
I traded in my honda Insight wich I did like it ainsight lot too but the new civic has more features.
