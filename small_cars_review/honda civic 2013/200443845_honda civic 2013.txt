I bought this Honda for one reason and one reason only:
reliability.
So In one year I have manged to clock 28,000 miles and have done nothing to the car outside of normal maintenance, which is great.
I have been able to achieve 50 mpg with careful, skilled driving on a one off, fluke of a drive.
I can routinely obtain 42 mpg with respectable driving and 33-35 mpg with a heavy foot.
The brakes are not the best as I have locked them up a few times without noticing the ABS pulse from the pedal.
Also, there is a blind spot from the roof pillar between the windshield and left door that is very annoying on mountain roads.


Altogether, a good car and I'm happy I bought it.

Great car, love the test drive. I now regret the purchase.
I have NEVER experience such an uncomfortable ride.
It hurts to drive the care,
Im now debating to lose $2K and trade the car in for something else.
I was a true Honda fan, I have owned Honda vehicles for over 20 years. I'm very disappointed "Honda you should be ashamed".

I have never received good fuel economy with this car. It has never given me what was advertised as 28 in the city and 39 on highway.
It has never gone past 23 miles to the gallon.
I am very disappointed in this cars fuel economy.
I'm wondering if there is something wrong with the car and it is now only
1 month old.

Just bought a 2013 Civic coupe with automatic transmission for my wife last week. On a lark, I wanted to see how much mileage I could squeeze out of this car using the lightest foot possible. I needed to drive to the airport - a nearly 50 mile round trip. On the trip there, I drove with no AC at speeds between 60 and 70. The on board mileage computer registered 53 mpg! There is a minor downhill bias since I live a few hundred feet above sea level and the airport is near sea level.

On the trip back, I decided to use the AC. When I arrived home, the MPG computer for the total trip read 43 MPG. That's close to a hybrid's MPG! I am delighted with this car!

I've had this car for 12 days, & I've got 1,500 miles on it. I love it so much so far, but I can't really speak truthfully about its reliability b/c I haven't had any problems w/ it since I haven't had it for very long at all.

I drive about 75% highway & 25% city, & I have an average of 36.75 MPG.

'10 Jetta lease was up.
I dislike the styling of the new Jettas so I went in for a '13 Accord Sport and left with a '13 Civic LX. Both great cars but I enjoyed the handling and overall feel of the Civic a bit more. I now prefer the Civic dashboard over a typical one (surprisingly). I also own a '12 Subaru Impreza which seems a lot zippier to 40mph but it's also not nearly as quite (loud CVT and road noise) which for a daily commute of 120 miles is very important.
My daily commute broken down is 40 miles city and 80 miles highway. I average 37mpg not using ECO but I use cruise control often. Over 400 miles per tank. I get compliments from my co-workers for what it is...a nice compact car.
