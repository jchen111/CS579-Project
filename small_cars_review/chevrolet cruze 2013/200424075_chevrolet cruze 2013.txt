I bought my chevrolet cruze in hopes of obtaining a reliable vehicle. 1 year later at around 34k miles I started having problems. It stalled. I brought it to the dearlship. They couldnt figure it out and had to use a diagnostic tree since the computer wasnt operating properly. They then replaced the mass air flow sensor, billed me $300 and the vehicle is still there until corporate call them
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
our organisation purchased 5 Chevy cruzes at the beginning of 2013. I personally drove 3 of them for extended periods of time. In the first year of owning these cars, we put roughly 30,000 miles on them. We never had any serious problems with the vehicles. There was only one time that a light came on in one of the turbo diesel cruzes and it was just the self-clean feature for the engine. If that ever happens, just let the car run for about 30 minutes at 2000 RPMs.

The Chevy Cruze is a disaster. Do not buy this car. It had been recalled twice, but not recalled for known faulty transmission. The car surges and jerks. My 2 year old car needed a NEW transient, but to top it off, I have been back three times Ina week, because the new one isn't installed correctly. Stick with Honda or Nissan.

Seat bottoms have very skimpy padding so I cannot use the car for long drives.

Suspension is too firm so bumps are not absorbed.
Lots of road noise on coarse surfaces.
Overall it's a primitive driving experience.
Corollas and Elantras I have rented were far more refined and comfortable.

Also, dash controls are difficult to see (tiny icons) and figure out how they work.
Corolla dash controls are straighforward.

Thick door pillars create blind spots

I bought this car on 2/11/13 and as of 3/7/13(less than 30 days!) it is in the shop getting a new engine placed.
Why? Unsure, the Chevy dealership could not figure out the problem so I get a new engine placed.
Lucky me, I get to make my first car payment while it is on a lift in the Chevy dealership.
Reliability is gone!
I was a former Toyota owner and wish now that I had purchased another one (12 years of absolutely no problems!)
I just hope that this car lasts as long as my payments do.
Very disappointed with this product.
I wish I could just get a refund and be done with this!
