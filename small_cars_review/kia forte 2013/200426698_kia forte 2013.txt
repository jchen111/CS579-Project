I needed a car that got good gas and good value. I commute 160 miles a day (20 miles dirt road). Getting 31 MPG on average. This is my 4th Kia and one of the reasons of staying with them is the 100,000 warr. & all the options that are included with them. We drive our cars till they fall apart so the resale value means nothing.

Since I was starting a new job that entailed a considerable commute, I needed a car with good gas mileage that didn't hurt the wallet too much.
However, since I was going to be spending a considerable amount of time in the car, I wanted as many creature comforts as possible for a low price.
The Kia Forte SX 2.4 litre does not sip fuel as well as the 2.0 litre, but I found that driving 100km/hour(legal speed limit here in Ontario), I could attain exactly the 6.2 litres/100km that was advertised...until my last fill-up.
The odometer reached 9700 km and at 70-80km/hr while taking the scenic route home, the average consumption dipped to 5.1litres/100km. The 80km trip averaged 5.5litres/100km.
