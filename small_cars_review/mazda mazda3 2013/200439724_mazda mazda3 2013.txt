I recently bought this car used, having searched for a GT with manual transmission. I had bought a 2012 Skyactive GT with auto since the manual was not available. Wow! What a difference the transmission makes. Drivability is greatly improved with such a slick shifter and smooth clutch. It's the best manual I've driven, having previously owned 06 and 09 Mazda 3's with manual. Engine power is modest but made more than bearable due to excellent handling and truly outstanding gas mileage. Add to that a fully functional in-dash touchscreen navigation, blind spot monitoring, keyless entry and ignition, auto wipers, and articulating headlights and you have a great automobile.

Recently purchased after trading in Hyundai Veloster. Like night vs. day, this fun vehicle is far superior to the Veloster. Acceleration, Handling, Comfort, Bluetooth, etc. can't be beat.

This is my third Mazda and it was a mistake to think that Hyundai could be anywhere near as good as a Mazda.
