I actually wanted a sporty handling car, at least for a compact.
However, I was not prepared for the horrible ride quality the 3 has on anything but perfect roads.
The car feels unstable, the freeway ride is awful with the car tramlining all over the place.
2 dealers told me that's just the way the car rides.
Biggest mistake was buying this car over the Chevy Cruze.

I traded my '13 Ford Focus (that I bought brand new), for my brand new Mazda3. Let me tell you this car is better in all aspects. The Focus was very nice, but could not get used to the Dual Clutch transmission. I was in heaven when I test drove my Mazda, it drives better then the Focus, it shifts better, handles better. Everyone says how the Mazda3 has hard plastic all over the place on the inside, I don't know about you but I don't drive and tap my fingers on the dashboard at the sometime. Yes, somethings could of been made and/or placed different, but I've never seen a car where everything is perfect, but the Mazda3 comes pretty darn close.
