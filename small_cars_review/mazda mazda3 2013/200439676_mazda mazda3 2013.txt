Of so many choices in the compact car market, Mazda's marketing motto has been "Zoom Zoom".
Well, I bought into that hype but found the car to be just one of the economy compact cars.
It gets decent mileage and it is fun to drive if you rev the engine and give up the mileage.
You do pay a bit more than other compacts for the privilege of enjoying the "Zoom Zoom" - which is really about the car handling, not the acceleration.
Interior is a bit old compare to Hyundai/Kia. The major surprise that I found is the terrible road noise. Don't know if it's the factory tires or the car itself, but this is one of the nosiest compact!

Very nice car. Looks expensive and handles great. Learning manual again but coming along quickly. Love the key-less entry and telescopic steering wheel. Stock stereo's not bad... Smooth ride for a compact.

This has been my first Mazda. I was going to go with a 2011 VW golf 6-speed, but the mazda had better MPG and better accessories already included for the price. Plus the mazda has much more room in it. I'm 6'5 and I fit wonderfully in the front seats.This has been my first manual ever driven and its been great! I bought it at 240 mi and within a month it now how 1,250 mi and the only problems that I had run into is a key fob problem, which is replaced under warranty, the boot won't close if you close it too hard, and that the back seats are WAY too small.
