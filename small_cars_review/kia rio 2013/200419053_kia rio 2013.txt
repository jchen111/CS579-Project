I bought my Rio LX hatchback a little over a month ago. I have the 6 speed automatic, and just about nothing else as far as extras. I am not into fluff on cars, but this one is nicely equipped and has all the amenities that one needs in a basic daily driver.

The little 1.6 liter engine is spirited off the line (slows down a little bit after that), and gives me decent numbers. I drive in a lot of heavy, stop and start, traffic, and I get about 26-28 mpg overall. Highway mileage hovers around 40....this is without the active ECO button engaged (turns the car into a slug).

I was out the door at $15,250 with my new Rio. An exceptional deal .


Car has 3,000 miles on it and I love it.
Best to use NON-ethanol gasoline as the engine works better and youll pick up a couple more MPG.
I get 33 MPG combined driving .
Car is very comfortable for my 6'3" big frame.
I swapped out the steering wheel so now I have cruise control which is a must for me.
Color is red and it looks clean even when you haven't washed it in weeks.
Very pleased I got this over the Nissan Versa with the lower warranty.

My daughter recently bought a Kia Rio. After a blowout (sidewall), we were shocked to find out there was no spare and no jack! There was a silly little pump and some compound that is supposed to fix flats! But not sidewall damage - the most common damage to modern radial tires!
Furthermore, the salesman at Courtesy Kia (Henderson, NV) never informed her that there was no spare! And if that is not enough, it took here over an hour to navigate the phone maze and get in touch with roadside assistance to told to "go buy an new tire and we'll come and put it on! What a rip off and quite dangerous! We live in Nevada and if you get stranded on some lonely road in the summer, you could die!
