I hated to sell my 2002 PR5 which drove like a sport car ...  was a Miata in wagon.  It had 234M and worried about breaking down on long trips  My 2014 3 rides quieter (not a bad thing), gets better gas mileage 40 vs 30 highway but not as fun driving as the PR5.  For me, this car drives  "numb" ... I can't a feel of it because it's so smooth.  I owned a 2007 Speed 3 as well so my other Mazda's were sporty, driver's car.  If you want a "smooth", sporty Vanilla car with very good gas mileage, I recommend this car.  2.0 has strong enough power for my needs, but do miss the other cars.
