Have only had it for 2 weeks and 700 kms (Canadian) but I love this car! Upgraded the 18' VW Khartoum wheels so it has a nice sporty look, ride comfort is great and so far fuel mileage has been great! All around a perfect car for me, I'll be doing about 3,000 KM a month. Performance is surprising for a TDI, although I have never owned one, I've heard in the past they were sluggish, not this, once the turbo kicks in it does pretty good!

I purchased my Jetta TDI nearly 4 months ago (Jan. 21), and loved it at first, but it has rapidly begun to fall apart already. The navigation system is an utterly useless waste of money, the "premium" Fender sound system develops so many vibrations that one cannot even enjoy listening to music, and the door panels started rattling while driving, after less than 2 months of ownership, so I can't even enjoy driving the car anymore. It's a shame, because the fuel economy and powertrain are both fantastic, but overall, I would not recommend this car to my worst enemy. I have grown to hate it that much. VW won't even stand behind their product and make it right. Don't waste your money.

Reluctantly traded in my Nissan Frontier for this car and had some buyer's remorse when I left the dealership.
That has quickly changed when I got close to 600 miles on my first full tank.
Everything I've read about the TDI indicates they get better mileage than what they're rated for by the EPA and this seems to be true.
I had bought my truck to haul all my kid's sports equipment to and from games and practices before I took a new job that requires lots of travel.
Ironically I traded a Jetta 2.5-S for the Frontier and now I find myself driving a Jetta again!
This time around, the trunk is roomier than the previous one.
I am able to fit a large softball equipment bad, a bucket of
