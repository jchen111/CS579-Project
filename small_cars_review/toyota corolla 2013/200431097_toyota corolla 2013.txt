I bought this car for my daughter's 16th birthday so that she could take it to college when she is 18 and it is perfect for her.
No problems at all.
With that being said, my 2005 Sienna was in the shop recently and I had to put my family of 5 in it to go around town in.
That put approximately 700 lbs of weight in the car.
This car was very sluggish with this much weight in it.
It had absolutely no get up and go to it. It is not a family car. My husband who is 5'10" had a really hard time fitting in the car and was very uncomfortable in it.
This car is only good for one or two people and that is it.

I bought my 2013 toyota corolla LE last July. I've had two big problems so far. 
1) screeching noise when cold start ( it has been going on for the whole winter)
2) starts from last month ( my car has 3500 miles so far), there has been whistling noise come from the front of my car when I speed up ( with the window open, I can hear very clearly. When the window is closed, I can barely hear it). The noise is really annoying......it makes me so worried...I'm so scared by car problems....
The reason I bought a new car is because I don't want to have car problem any more...but look at this...........
Does anyone has the same car problems as I do?

I have had the 2014 Corolla LE plus for less than two weeks.
During that time, anytime the temperature drops below 20 degrees F, the front windows won't come down (open) I took it in for service, but everyone in the dealership I spoke with swore up and down that the same happens in cold weather to their front windows, too.
I lodged a complaint with Toyota corporate, but they say they can't do anything about it now.

I was looking at the Civic LX and The Corolla LE.
I ended up with the Corolla.
The dealer I worked with gave me an ok deal on the car and my trade, but it was the 0% financing that sealed the deal. I will say that I am not impressed with this car at all.
It was in the garage 2 different time before I had 500 miles on it.
vvt-i gears, both of them.
Now I'm going to be making another appointment because I'm getting a very hard shift from 1st to 2nd gear.
I should have went with the Civic.

I actually can't wait to get rid of this car, and I've only had it 5000 miles.
The Bluetooth in the 2014 Corolla does NOT have voice dialing.
It really sucks.
You cannot even view your contacts while driving.
You cannot manually enter a phone number while driving. 
There are only two ways to make a call while the car is in motion:
1. Calling a recent number (called out or received while in the car).
2. Speed dials, if you have placed that person in your speed dial entry in the car...which is limited in the number of entries.
Maybe it's my phone, but it only locks up after pairing with the car.

2013 Corolla LE w/ complete package. Cute, stylish & economical car. Was averaging around 30-34 mpg in town. Full tank gets you 400 miles + . Had steering wheel issue but the problem was fixed by dealership under warranty. Touch screen display not as responsive & had to push it a couple times. Entunes could use some improvement. The sound system is nice. Loved my sunroof. Sometimes it's much nicer to drive a smaller car because you can make quick u turns & fit into smaller parking areas. I really liked this car but it didn't have enough power for me. I didn't feel comfortable merging on to busy freeways/highways. Also space & leg room felt kind of tight. Other than that this is a great car.

I had enough issues with my 2009 Corolla to trade in for a new 2013 Corolla.
So far I really enjoy driving this vehicle and cannot wait for a road trip.
Compared to the 2009 version the 2013 Corolla drives like a luxury vehicle.
The pep seems to match the 2009 vehicle which is not spectacular but adequate and I love some of the standard items that added to help Toyota keep up with the American car makers.

Decided to give Corolla a try, bought new from dealership. Huge mistake!!!
In the light you can't tell as well, but overcast and evenings it's horrible.

Front fender does not match hood and front doors, front doors do not match rear doors, rear doors do not match quarter panels. Dealer admitted seeing problem and called corporate Toyota. Corporate said since we see it on all white Corollas, it is "normal". Took to arbitration (as "required" by Toyota before court) who also sees mismatch but does not deem it to be a "defect"

I'm not talking about the horribly mismatched bumpers here, but the metal panels. If you don't like feeling you got screwed, don't get a white Corolla

Currently leased 2013 Corolla LE.
My wife had 2 previous leases 06 and 09.
Both were better Corollas.
I appreciate some of the new improvement s like USB port, but the older models were more comfortable and felt more nimble.
That being said the lease was definitely cheaper than what I would have gotten for say a Focus, Cruze, or Sentra.
If you're looking for a Corolla I would say look for '07 to '10 model used and don't worry about Bluetooth and USB ports.
You can get by without.
I think the model has regressed.
 Really dull ride.
Unfortunately, I disregarded my kids 4,7 in the decision.
No room in the back seat for them!

I bought a 2013 corolla LE after trading in my old car. I ended up with corolla when I wanted a Civic because of lower insurance and retail price. Biggest mistake ever. I didn't thoroughly research the car and its competitors before making my decision. The car rides OK. Very quiet cabin and good fuel economy but it's very boring and the styling looks outdated for a 2013...but it does the job. I don't think this car has a good resale value. Many of its competitors offer more bang for the buck and I'm seeing many of these corollas already for sale when it's barely 1 or 2 years old. Toyota is also redesigning the corolla next year so that'll likely further hurt its value.
