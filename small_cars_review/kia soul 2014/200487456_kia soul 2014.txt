I am a senior and this vehicle is easy to get into and out of. You set up high for better view out which is good except for out the rear corners. The  fairly large mirrors and backup camera minimize this problem.

The initial quality was very good(fit and finish). Vehicle was driven on a 3k mile trip of country roads and mountains from Oklahoma to North Carolina and was comfortable and fun to drive,averaged 31.2 mpg with two people and loaded.(4k miles)

Car seems to get the best mileage if you stay at 70mph or less. A little bouncy on rough roads but cruises nicely on the open road. Steering is tight and brakes are good,a little touchy until you get used to them.

Overall great car
