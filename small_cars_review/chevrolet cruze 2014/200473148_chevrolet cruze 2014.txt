Hard to know where to start. Alarm system goes off when I try to get into car. I am normal size (5'10", 170 lbs.) but I have to contort myself to get into drivers seat. Seat belt has too much tension. Right knee rests against hard surface--gets sore on long ride. Very little leg room for driver. Very poor visibility. Head rests and rear pillars block view when I back out of parking space. Stereo sounds tinny. Style is bleh. Key body is too large and bulky. Passengers find it difficult to get in and out. Feels like a sardine in a can.

What can you expect from a company vehicle? If you see a car simply as an appliance,it's not bad. But if you are looking for a sedan with comfort and performance, shop somewhere else. The Cruze is pretty lousy.
The car is underpowered for a sedan weighing over 3,000 pounds. If you are going 70 MPH on the highway and step on the accelerator, hoping to pass up another car, this thing is a dog. You are better off getting a Corolla for a little better price and better MPG. Only 29 MPG is not very rave fuel economy for a car with only 138 HP. 
Worst yet are the seats. it's like sitting on a cement park bench. Everyone at my company who drives this car complains about the discomfort.

I purchased this car 3 month ago, since then i have got back pain and also i have a terrible pain in my right leg and is worst every time a ride this junk. Seats are so hard and external padding is too high, i use a cushion but i continue in the same way, i tried to trade in to a different car but in the process i can lose more than $4000.00. Also when i turn on the air conditioning comes a chemical odor from the air vents, i have to open all windows until it disappear.
I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS CAR.
I decided to buy this car because i have always been a GM fan, all my cars in the past were from this company except a Fusion that was terrible too.

I recently purchased the rainforest green Cruze LS 1.8L 6 speed automatic. The cars exterior and interior styling is very impressive. So far this car has been excellent, with mostly city driving we are averaging 26 mpg. The interior is user friendly and very nice for an entry level car. There is almost no road noise while driving under 50 mph. The handling is tight however on worn roads you will feel a little play in the steering. This is not a car you could put 4 adults in comfortably, but children fit just fine in the back. Chevy is definitely going in the right direction with their designs and driver friendly focus.
