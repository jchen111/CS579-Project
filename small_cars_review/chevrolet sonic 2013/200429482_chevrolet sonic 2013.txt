Have about 600 miles now on my new Sonic LS Hatch 5speed manual.
 Overall I am very pleased.
Steering is light & crisp, ride is poised and quiet and the car feels solid.
 I have been impressed.
Entry to/from the rear seats is no problem and my kids all are wanting me to take them to their events in this little car.
I bought this car as my 3rd car for a runabout and for my kids to drive.
I traded in a Hyundai Elantra and have found the clutch, shifter and steering to be superior to what I had in the Hyundai.
---One thing I really dislike:
There is a terrible reflection in the windshield of the dash and its shiny materials...especially on sunny days.
So annoying.
Chevy---plz help !
