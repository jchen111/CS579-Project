My parents worked with Andre before on the purchase of my dad's camero and had a wonderful experience the first time, which is why my mom chose to go back and have Andre sell us my new Chevy Sonic. I love the car! For the price, the options that come with it are unavailable at other places. This deal just seemed to fit what we were looking for perfectly! 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought a 2013 Sonic LS sedan in late Feb., 2013.
3,400 miles on it.

The steering feels loose, especially at highway speeds.
Wanders in the lane and you constantly have to correct.
Took it back to Chev. dealers 3 times and they said nothing was wrong.
I've owned/driven many small cars and never had this issue before.
The heater takes a long time to warm up.
No engine temperature gauge.
Poor visibility.
Rough ride.
Idles rough.
Must use synthetic oil (Dexos).
Transmission not smooth.
Very cheap, ugly upholstery.
MyLink sound system but no CD player.
Want to buy American?
This has a Hungarian engine, Korean tires, and Chinese spare tire.
Buy something else, not a Sonic.
