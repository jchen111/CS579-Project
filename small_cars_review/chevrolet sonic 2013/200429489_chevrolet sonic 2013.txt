I have mixed feelings writing this review. Overall, I really like my 2013 Sonic LT hatchback. The interior is very roomy for a car in this class and I like the design. However, my car has developed a water leak on the passenger side. As of 10/27/13, my car has been at the dealer trying to correct the problem for two of the past three weeks. Postings on a Sonic forum have confirmed that this is happening to many people. There is a serious design flaw with this model. Equipped with the 1.4L turbo and no water leaks, this car would be nothing short of excellent.

After deciding to keep my money local and also buy American.I decided on the Chevy Sonic after reading reviews and seeing TV commercials for the car advertising 40 mpg.Boy was this the biggest mistake I ever made in my life.The car has no take off power the transmission clunks and bangs into gear the radio comes on when ever it feels like it and when the brakes are applied the car shakes so bad you have to pull over to stop it from shaking. And that's the short list.The 40 mpg is BS mine struggles to get 32.No wonder GM had to take a bailout they couldn't build a decent car and they lie to the general public about MPG.Keep up the good work Japan you have no worries here.

Words cannot adequately express how much I love my car! 
I had been driving the same vehicle for over 14 years. And I decided that enough was enough. It was time to get something different.
And it was the best decision that I have made in a very long time!

The suspension is poor.
 It does not soak up bumps well, or handle potholes well, producing a very uncomfortable ride.
Unless you are living in an area with beautifully paved streets and you drive on them all the time - this probably won't matter.
 And also suspension is designed poorly - unstable. The car jolts left and right when hitting rough pavement, making me wonder what happens if you're on the expressway going fast and you run into this. I think the car is accident prone.
 The 1.8 engine is noisy, lacks passing power,
and wind/road noise is excessive. The 1.4Turbo option quiets the engine noise somewhat and increases torque, but does nothing about the excessive road noise caused by poor insulation. This car is built a little but like the old suv's. Thin and high, rather than long and wide. The center of gravity is too high and too narrow instead of being low and wide. Test drive one yourself and see if i'm right. 

 On the plus, it's much better than the car it replaces - The Aveo. So if you liked that car, you'll love this one. Me, i'll skip it. 

Now also think about this: this same 1.8 engine is being used in the much heavier chevy cruz LS also.
So do you think you should avoid that trim line?
If you decide on the cruz, opt for a higher model with the 1.4 turbo, but it's also much more expensive.

The best part is I can fit my convertible car seat, a infant car seat and still fit an adult in the back seat (traveled 150 miles like that today) The fuel seems good but i'm not sure, i went on a 2 hour drive today an back, an used almost 7 gallons of gas, i was pretty upset with that. Backing out of my drive way, whenever my tires go down the front of the car hits into the drive way, it does that on alot of people's out where I live... not much i can do about it, but they are really low to the ground.
It's a great car , but we will see as the time goes on. Oh and the throttle is horrible!
