The only thing that I do not like on this car would be the crappy tires that come from the factory.
Even with traction control and just a tiny bit of snow there is no traction.
I truly feel that better tires would make this car unstoppable.

I have had a few issues with the bluetooth system and my phone.
Some phones work better than others but I have not had my dealer check these issues yet.

The car is easy to drive, gets around in traffic like a dream, and with the turbo, it can certainly keep up.


Gas mileage is great.
I'm getting around 35mpg on the highway consistently.


I'll say so far so good.
I've had the car almost a year and have around 15,500 miles on it.

I own a 2013 Sonic LTZ turbo with manual transmission.
This is the quietest, most solid feeling, most fun to drive, and best equipped car you can buy at this price point.
Turbo motor provides great acceleration with excellent fuel economy.
Cabin is extremely comfortable and spacious for a subcompact, even with the sunroof, and cabin materials look richer than they actually are.
MyLInk stereo offers a LOT, but there are no knobs, You must take your eyes off the road to adjust volume or FM tuner.
