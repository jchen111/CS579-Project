I had an idea of what kind of car I had wanted. I had been researching hatchbacks for 6-months already. A friend of mine bought the 2012 accent so I was already familiar with the car. The moment I walked on the lot a Hyundai of Escondido the sales man walked me to the selection they had. All I had to do was pick the color. Im a musician so I needed a car with plenty of trunk space that is easily accessible. The entire team at Esco Hyundai was above and beyond helpful with teaching me all the features and sat with me until I understood it all.

I've had 3 Toyotas, and have had a new 2013 Hyundai Accent Hatchback for over 2 months.
I simply love it. Quality, reliability and styling match or exceed my previous cars.
Interior is very quiet, car is a blast to drive, and the styling is awesome.
I like small cars because of their handling and ease of parking.
I could afford a mid or full-size car, but why would I want one?
This car fits what I need and want, and is tops in its class on virtually all measures.
You cannot go wrong buying one.
You'll love it.

My wife and I were looking for a commuter care (90% city/10% highway).
With stop lights every mile to half-mile we are averaging 28 to 29mpg (w/o AC). This breaks even with my 06Â Civic (5-speed manual). As I am use to driving a manual, I do find that the automatic transmission could be more responsive and that the car shifts up a gear a little too early (to improve fuel economy).
For example, this is annoying when traffic goes from 35-25-35: Civic (3rd-3rd-3rd) / Accent (4th-3rd-4th).
While the 6-speed automatic has shorter gear ratios, I still feel like it is shifting too early and this causes the RPMs to spike and the car to pull forward more eagerly than anticipated.

I love my new 2013 Accent, it drives very nicely, though I prefer not to use the ECO button as suggested by the dealer, it losses too much power and reaction. MPG I am avereging 28-30 overall. It appears that the MPH indicator is way off since I have kept track of every mile and fuel fillup, When I show 30 miles to empty I can only add just over 9 gallons? the vehicle has 11 gallon tank? so really instead of reading 30 miles till empty it should show 80-90? After going below 30 the reading blanks out.
Another major gripe is the lack of a spare tire and would you believe it no dealer or third party currently carries one? So get a real flat and your going to regret it. I added autostart
