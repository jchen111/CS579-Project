Purchased the car for under 30k and was a great value. Cost for my 36 mile commute is now 0.50 instead of 3.50 (or the cost of a gallon at the time). It has had a few recalls but when those fixes were applied, no issues and nothing really to maintain. No oil changes or fluids/belts/chains/etc. I love the fact that I never go to gas stations, just plug in nightly like my cellphone and ready to go in a couple of hours (with the 220v wall charger). We have a second car for trips, but I think renting a car for the few long trips of the year would be fine if we didn't have a second vehicle. Overall, I am sold on electric and am likely to stick with all electric for my commute/around town car!

After owning a Ford Focus EV for a year, I advise consumers to be very skeptical about them.  I loved it at first, until the battery died several times at stop lights!  We were told it needed a software update to fix the problem.  That seemed to work for several months, until the battery died completely again.  Having an almost brand new car and then having to deal with towing, figuring out how to get to work with out it, etc., is a tremendous hassle and downside.  There are no substitute cars because substitutes won't be able to use the car pool lane.  Dealers have very little knowledge about the Focus EV, which also is incredibly frustrating.   Overall, a very bad experience with this car.
