Bought a brand new 2013 Ford Focus Titanium with all the options including navigation and the handling package which comes with 20,000 mile summer tires that are ridiculously expensive to replace.

We had severe transmission noise from day one.

The transmission was grinding really loud along with some clunking noises, people walking or riding a bicycle would stare at a brand new car wondering what was wrong with it.

In 4000 miles the car was in the shop four times for transmission issues over a six month period.

The local Ford dealer finally agreed to replace the transmission control computer, it took three weeks to get the part in from China, it didn't fix the problem.

I have the Focus SE sedan with the faulty automatic transmission. I bought it brand new and first noticed the transmission to start acting crazy around 4500 miles.
I've read many similar complaints and see that Ford won't correct the problem. They issued a TSB on these trannies only to replace the clutch pack which doesn't help. They say it's the way it's designed to operate and theres no fix.
WHAT ?
Then why issue the TSB ? When I test drove the car it didn't do this. I would have stayed away then.
Car lunges forward at stops, backs up by itself without giving it gas, the shift shuttering/slipping is the biggest problem.

I have now put on 12,000 miles on my 2013 ford focus se with 6speed dct auto. It has been a great car. Don't be afraid of the transmission. It shifts very smooth is nice. If you drive consistently and don't step on the gas hard it very rarely gives a bad shift. If you step on the gas hard it can be slow to downshift or sometimes might stay in existing great instead of upshifting. The transmission is an automated manual and thats how it gets amazing gas mileage. I get 39/40 mpg real world driving when the weather is good and I drive about 80% highway 20% city. In low speed driving like a parking lot it is not as nice as a regular automatic but it is fine just be easy on the gas. T

I purchased my 2013 Ford Focus new and now have about 11,000 miles on it.
I optioned for the SFE package for better fuel economy.
I have getting about 36 mpg combined city and highway.
It has been a great car and very easy to drive.
I would recommend this car.

I am very unhappy with the "new transmission" Ford has put in the new 2013 Focus. My car is 7 months old and has had 4 visits for the same issue. Last month it was in the shop for almost 2 weeks due to a leak of a seal and needing a new clutch. The transmission shifts inappropriatly and puts me at high risk for smashing into a car ahead of me. The answer given by the Ford employees is that I need to learn the car and how to drive it. Unacceptable answer!

I bought a Ford Focus 2013 a couple of months ago being told it had an automatic transmission.
It jerked and acted weird during the test drive, but the salesman said it would "learn" my driving style in 2 weeks.
After 2 months and 450 miles , took it to service dept for low gas mileage (less than 20 city) and jerky transmission. They said it takes 1,000 - 3,000 to break in.
Read the other blogs and asked them to take it back.
Ford offered us a lousy deal, so we traded it in and bought a new Camry.
Real car with a smooth transmission and gets better gas mileage than the Focus.
Ford needs to recall the "automatic" Focus.
The transmission doesn't work!
Buyer beware!!

just traded out and lost $$$$ of this 6 mo old 6000 mi junk. it was unsafe at any speed with its fixed 3x steering and jerky transmission. ford knows all about but this crooked co wont do a thing other than say its fine nothing wrong even though it replaced the whole steering system to no avail problem is in the computer. in any case a word to the wise....

The Focus Ti I have looks sharp,but it's not dependable technology wise .
 I have been locked out of it twice.The 8 inch display has frozen on me so as I couln't call to get help.The phone unpairs three times a week as Ford after 5years hasn't got syncing their cars
right yet.
 Just Google all the complaints by owners who bring their cars back and the service people blame the phone or the weather.
 Served my country and got screwed and tried to belive in an American car and got screwed again.

Not the dealers fault or the poor mechanic who's not a techie,Ford is in one big mess.
 I'll have my German car by 2015.
 What a waste 
 of $25,585 sticker price I had to pay excise tax on.

I researched Mazda 3, Chevy Cruze, Buick Verano, & Ford Focus, & contacted dealers online.
Then I test-drove them in that order.
When I got to the Ford, the car just felt right for me in a field of very good cars.
Ended up buying a Titanium sedan at Cerritos Ford in September 2012.
Great service from sales rep Kathy Bailey & service rep Sergio Ortiz.

Drove the car across the desert southwest when it had less than 500 miles on it, was pleased at gas mileage of 37 & doubly pleased that the long drive was less tiring than in my 2008 Lincoln.
The car is adequately powered, great handling, quiet, smooth, & best of all, fun to drive.

I recently purchase a brand new Ford Focus Titanium. I am very happy and would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a cool-looking ride with great fuel mileage in mind. My car has everything except for a moon roof. It's a little tight on room but you must consider that I am 304 lbs. So, of course it's going to be snug. Everything works great and the transmission shifts just fine. It's quiet and smooth and in my honest opinion, the best Focus that Ford has ever produced.
Purchased at: Mac Haik Ford-Lincoln in 
Georgetown , Texas. 
The Titanium package is the way to go! Or as an alternative, choose the SE model with the 201A option package.
