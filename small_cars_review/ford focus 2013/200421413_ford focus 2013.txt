I bought a pre-owned 2013 Focus SE on June 18th 2014.
I was initially impressed by the styling and that it was loaded with tech.
Unfortunately, all the tech in the world could not make up for the DCT and how awful it was to drive. Even the tech left a lot to be desired.
While I initially liked it, I found the controls for the infotainment system to be very hard to use while driving. The saving grace was that it had voice commands to bypass the very convoluted menu setup.
It took less than two months to see the writing on the wall about this car and I traded it in for a Honda Civic.
I ended up losing money because I traded it in so soon but it was the best decision ever!!

ery good choice, however for maximum reliability (and long term maintenance cost savings) skip the Dual Clutch and the My Ford Touch options.

Bought in July 2013, 5000 troublefree, comfortable miles so far. The Manual transmission's the better choice by far (you take a little hit in fuel economy ironically, but trust me, it's gonna cost a LOT less to maintain than the dual clutch)
Comfortable on long drives (- saw an average of 39 MPG on 800 mile trip ), adequate pep for city stop and go, plus passing on highways (3rd gear is very sweet around 5500 rpm . . . ). 
Definitely spec'ed well, and punches a bit above its price range - But get the manual w/o MFT

company car and no one want to drive it. terrible in rain, transmission jumps, front end sounds like fall apart ect....

I had a toyotay camry, saw all the great commercials about the gas milage on the focus, and thought wow better than the camry, so i bought a 2013 ford focus titanium flex fuel, wow what a big mistake if i could get rid of this today i would hate everything about this car, gas mileage sucks, sounds and acts weird like it is going to fall appart any minute, will not make this mistake again, going back to toyota,,soon as i can.. this car sucks real BAD......

I got this car mainly because I have always owned Fords and they have always been reliable. As far as getting me where I need to go, this car is reliable. I have a love/hate relationship with my car mainly because some days it will run exceptionally smooth and some days it sounds like the wheels are going to fall off and it shakes like the transmission is going to fall out. I have heard the whole "give it a few hundred miles" speech, and well, I have given it 8,000 with no change. It's
mostly when I pull out, slow down and pick up speed again, or go up a steep hill that the transmission feels like its going to kick the bucket. But when it runs smooth, it runs smooth.

I love this car!
Got it in April, now have just 6000 miles on it.
Mileage started out a little low, 31 mph, but am now getting right around 37 mpg and I drive various traffic situations.

 I waited a long time to get a Focus, rode in several other Focuses and knew this is what I wanted although I had to trade in my 2000 Explorer XLS to get it.

I do miss the extra cargo space, but the overall ride, flip down rear seat makes up for it.


I have the Focus Sedan SE with 6 cyl. automated manual transmission.
 Did not see a selection for it.

fun ride
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought my focus back in February ( it is now April) and I have 4,000 miles on it. I commute 60 miles a day, 5 days a week, most of it highway.
The Focus is very comfortable on the highway. The ride quality is very smooth and composed, and the ride is quiet.
 

The interior is well put together, no squeaks/rattles.
The Engine has very good power and is smooth. the transmission isn't great, but is generally smooth and quick to shift.


Fuel economy is very good, averaging 32mpg in mostly highway driving with some city.
Exactly matching the EPA combined rating.


The backseat is a bit tight, though not intolerable for two adults.
Trunk is big. No problems so far.

I read a lot of reviews about the 2012 Focus before deciding to buy the 2013. The transmission does shift different than your normal automatic, but it doesn't bother me since I drive a commercial truck with a standard for a living. I love the style, the features and especially the gas mileage of my Focus, especially since I came out of a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I've only had it for a week, but I've been around cars long enough to know what works well and what doesn't, and I must say that the Ford Focus doesn't just work well, it excels.

I bought my 2013 Focus SE a month ago. I cried for two days over the crazy transmission. I now have 500 miles and it is driving better. The driver's seat is uncomfortable and lots of road noise. Not enough cup holders or storage space.If I could do it again, I would not buy this car! I am not trying to be negative, just stating what I feel about the car. I talked to the dealership about the road noise and the seat and they acted as though they have never heard any complaints, but I have read several. I do like some of the features and like the way it doesn't feel like a small car. Anyway, I am trying to love it because I have to pay for it for six years :(
