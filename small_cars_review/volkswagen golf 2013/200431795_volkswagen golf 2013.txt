Now I know why Golf is so popular in Europe after driving a while. 
The car is not fast; engine not quiet and the looking not sharp. Overall it has nice build quality, comfortable ride, and good handling. Very solid in and out. Many
upgrades and detailed features not mentioned in specs.
We had plenty of time researching before final decision. Extensively compared with Toyota Camry and RAV4, and compared within VW models. Passat feels so heavy, GTI is too dear for a collage kids; base Tiguan model looks plain and higher model is expensive. TDI does not have many benefits in America since diesel is expensive.
Prefered waiting for the next generation Golf, but wife insisted buying.
