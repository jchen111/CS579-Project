Purchased this car four months ago and have about 12,000 miles on it.
Very enjoyable to drive and car has exceeded nearly all expectations.

Don't be fooled by the 140 HP rating.
The diesel engine is super torquey and it has loads of power when you need it.
Won't blow anyone off the line but has great pickup through the 40-80 mph which makes highway passing very easy.

Handling is excellent and the car is great fun to drive.
My wife has an Audi A4 and prefers the Golf.

Interior design is good, but I wish they'd offer a leather seat option.
But I guess if they did, it would canibalize audi a3 sales.
