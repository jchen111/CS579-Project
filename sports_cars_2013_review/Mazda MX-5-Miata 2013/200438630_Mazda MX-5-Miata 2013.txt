I own this car, a 2013 Club edition, and wish I didn't.
This car is terrible, has no power what so ever.
Going up a hill, this car screams and whines with the gas pedal depressed to the floor, like it is just struggling with all its might to climb a little hill.
Driving at 65 miles an hour on the interstate is about the best it gets.
Passing another car is a chore.
The seats are very uncomfortable, and there is no room for anything in this car.
I knew it was going to be short on space, but I did not realize how the cramped space was going to impact my life in such a negative way.
 Forget a trip, no room for baggage!
And LOUD!
I can't hardly think while driving this noisy vehicle!
