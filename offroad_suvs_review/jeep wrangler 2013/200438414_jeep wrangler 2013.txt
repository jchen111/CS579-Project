This is my first Jeep, overall I am very impressed. I have wanted a Jeep for awhile. I wanted something that was capable and practical for everyday life as well.
This is a timeless vehicle that stands out in the parking lot or trailhead. With two young kids and all there stuff and mine, the unlimited was the way too go. A little tough for them to get in on their own right now, but this thing goes almost anywhere.
Which is what I love the most about my Jeep.
Especially living in the northeast lake effect snow belt.
The unlimited has good storage in the rear.
The alpine stereo and uconnect is a great feature.
