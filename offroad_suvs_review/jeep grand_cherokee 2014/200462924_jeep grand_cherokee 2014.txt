Bought a JGC Ltd. in January and loved almost everything about it.
But in May I had an accident that caused all of the front air bags to deploy.
The vehicle was repaired in about 3 weeks but I am now in my 7th week waiting for the knee air bag to arrive and be installed.
The collision center has done everything it can and I called Chrysler Support.
What a joke, they are telling me it will be another 8 weeks before the part will be available.
They have offered NOTHING in the way of support like a free rental car even though I have maxed out my rental insurance.
I will NEVER buy another Chrysler product.
How can they sell cars they don't have parts for?
Does the customer mean nothing?

After driving my 14 Limited for a year and 20K miles and countless days in the dealer I just could not take it anymore. Ac issues,Uconnect and transmission issues finally made me trade it in. I had a early production 14 and was working a deal with the dealer to trade it in on a latter 14. I started thinking twice about going through this hell with another Jeep. I thought I'd gave the dealer another chance to get the bugs worked out because I really liked the Jeep and had done several upgrades. It was in the shop this time for three days and was returned to me worse than when I took it in. I'm sorry to say I traded it in on the way home for a Volvo. I sleep at night now!

I leased a 2014 Grand Cherokee Limited in November, 2013.
It has a variety of problems some of which are serious safety issues that both
the dealer and Chrysler choose to ignore.
The transmission lags and lurches and makes periodic clanking noises.
Worse than that, mine has twice run up engine rpms while I was breaking to stop - a serious safety issue.
The
electronic shifter offers no advantages. but rather is distracting (requiring a look down to verify what gear you are in).
During an emergency situation I needed to stop and quickly shift into reverse to avoid a collision.
Using this shifter created a delay that almost killed me.
Several other problems none of which are fixed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Im at 6500 miles and the car has been at the shop 6 times.
The navigation system has not worked correctly the entire time.
It will not show the correct location, so is useless.
They have done 3 updates and are currently installing the 3rd radio as we speak trying to resolve the issue. Not the quatlity or the aggrevation I was expecting. Not to sure about the transmission either it seems to not shift correctly downhill it runs up the rpm's.
If this issue isnt resolved this time looks like I will be invoking the lemon law.
I waited along time for this car at this point its a dissappointment.

Two of our 4 kids are in college now and it was time to sell our T&C for a smaller car. Did an intense analysis looking for a new SUV: cheched 4Runner, Explorer, Mazda 7 and 9, Chevies. Nothing came close to the new 2014 GC in value and price. Mine Limited with roof, nav, hitch, everything heated was 34.5K before taxes - no other car had that amount of feature for comparable money. The quality of interior, driving experience, fuel economy (17.8 in city, 24 on the road - 8speed transmission!), quietness, the number of gadgets, electronics - totally satisfied! So far got 2000 miles.
