Too many other reviewers have complained about poor throttle response and the 'default to eco-mode' transmission.
Sport mode on the transmission is intuitive and impressive in its ability to hold a lower gear when torque is needed on demand.
I regularly toggle between 'D' and 'S' modes with a simple reward tug on the transmission selector handle for the times when I want fuel savings or for the times when throttle response is of utmost importance.

The base model Laredo is a two wheel drive model, and the only option I chose was 23E (8-way adjustable electric drivers seat).
I am averaging 20.8 MPG over 5500 miles of mixed city/highway driving.
Comfortable ride and fine handling.

Brand New 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee has been in the shop for 18 days in the 38, I have owned the car.
Transmission phantom shifts and revs unprovoked. There is a knocking in the front end when braking that the dealer said was an issue then came back to say that knocking is "normal" for all 2014 JGC. Also the same climate issues that other reviews state. 
I am a lifelong Jeep customer. Owned 6 in 20 years.
This will be our last one.

I purchased my Grand Cherokee in July of 2013.
I have the 2014 model. Since the beginning this car has been problems. Originally it was said that the system was new, that is why no one had any real knowledge on what to do when I had a problem. I have taken it in 8 times only for them to find one or two problems. The rest they said they can fix if it is not acting up at the time. I have had issues like the sunroof being stuck open, the dashboard going out, transmission not shifting correctly, radio went out, buttons on door won't lock them, just to name a few. I wish I had know then what I know no, I would have saved my money and my time. If you are in the market for a car this is not it. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought this car in March and it has been broken from day 1.The lights in the air conditioning panel never lit up but some of the others did. I asked the sales person about it and he said "those lights don't illuminate in this model". I brought the car back for service. They kept my car for the day, 'ran some updates' and they still didn't light up.
In addition my trunk wasn't opening 90% of the time. I was told if they couldn't duplicate the problem it couldn't be fixed. I took it to another service center instead.
The whole light panel had to be replaced and updates hadn't been done at all to my car from before I bought it.
Three trips later my trunk still wont open most of the time.

Took delivery of my new 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Drove it less than a mile from dealer. Transmission would not shift out of first, and radio would flip continuously. Faulty steering column control sensor. Took 1.5 weeks for the repair.

Drove it for a week and the dash lit up like a Christmas tree. Dealer said they could not duplicate the error. Searching forums, I found others have this problem. Faulty ABS module. The dealer contacted Chrysler at my insistence, who said the ABS module is bad. It is on national B/O.

I have been a loyal Jeep customer for years. Just know you are beta testing this vehicle. Never again!! Chrysler said they will not cover a rental, to make matters worse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bought this vehicle and it has been nothing but problems. Safety issues and quality issues. Good luck with your purchase.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To make a long story short, I picked up my 2014 JGC on June 13 with 12 miles. Made a right out the dealer lot and the radio (8.4a) would not stop flipping. Transmission would not shift out of first gear. Took it right back to the dealer. The steering column sensor was bad, which controls the radio and transmission. This part had to be approved and shipped by Chrysler. It took over a week for the dealer to receive the part, and another couple days to install the item and test the vehicle. 
I understand that mistakes happen and you can not expect perfection. However, a DOA vehicle, Chrysler's taking so long to repair a vehicle, and other little defects cause me to questions the build quality.
