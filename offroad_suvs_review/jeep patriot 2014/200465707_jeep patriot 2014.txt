I love my Patriot.


It is true, there are many SUV's to choose from with more flash and flare, but do not let the professional reviews deter you. 

I bought a fully loaded Patriot Latitude, with the Sun/Sound Group, Bluetooth, Automatic rear view mirror, and the Freedom Drive II off road package for under 23k.

It has been a year now and this Patriot has been an absolute joy to own.
I bought it to explore and have fun.
It has delivered.

First off, don't listen to the harsh reviews.
They aren't reasonable.
Secondly, this is NOT a Grand Cherokee.
The Patriot is a cute little SUV (my first).
It has all the comforts that a reasonable person would need, minus the elbow room of a larger vehicle.
Secondly...it IS a Jeep...not a Lincoln.
If you want a cute little SUV that rides and handles like a Jeep...then this is your car.
I, for one, love it.
The Latitude has all of the nice bells and whistles such as a nice stereo, hidden USB port for your iPOD, Blue Tooth for your phone, electric windows and door locks, heated seats, etc.

After researching many other SUVs, I discovered the Jeep Patriot.
I was looking for something that would fit my family of 4 and provide off road capability for outdoor adventures.
This SUV is awesome.
We took it off road and were able to go pretty much wherever we wanted. 
Outside of the off road package, the size is perfect for our small family.
The vehicle has plenty of room and seats us all comfortably.
The gas mileage is great and even though Edmonds complained about the performance of this vehicle, I have not had any problems with performance and do not agree with this part of their review. I highly recommend this vehicle.

I had a Titan and needed something more practical but cool looking at the same time. I researched numerous cars and became drawn to the Patriot. I got a great deal through the internet (dont go to dealer at 1st anymore, call the fleet sales or go to internet) and went to test drive it and check it out. I ended up being very surprised with the overall experience and purchased a black one.

The ride is smooth and the features which came with it are awesome. I have the sun sound package and remote start. Inside is nice as well. Nothing too flashy, but very simple and clean.

Im surprised with some of the negative reviews which it received. For the price, this is top of the line
