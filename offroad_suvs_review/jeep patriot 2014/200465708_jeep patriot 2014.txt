After 1.5 years ownership, we have been very pleased with our 2014 Patriot Sport, 2.4L, 6 speed auto, 2wd.  It suits our farm lifestyle fine.

Pre purchase research shows the engine to be unrefined, but extremely reliable and trouble free.  Paired with the 6 speed auto, it is quieter and has adequate zip for safe driving.  It is easy and economical to service if you are a diy'er. 

Ride and comfort are good.  Suspension and road noise are what one would expect on a utility vehicle.....worse than a large touring sedan but completely acceptable. 

Considering last winter the worst in decades, it handles rain and snow excellent (even 2 wheel drive).

I bought one of these a week ago. My package is known as the Oscar Mike, which is a sub-package of the Latitude. My main goal was to replace my current vehicle with one that my increasingly aged parents can get in and out of better. The previous car was a 2003 Merc Sable. My parents can hop in and out of the car without too much difficulty and for when mom needs a wheelchair, that fits in the back without too much effort.

My wife and I purchased our Patriot at the end of August , we bought it for her to drive back and forth to work and around town , she loves it , the handling is excellent , the ride is firm yet forgiving , we have the 2.4 engine and it has the power to get out of its own way and then some , we average 26mpg , its rated at 21/27 we get 24/30 . And yes it is a 4x4 haven't been able to use that feature yet I was told NO 4 wheeling in her jeep lol.
