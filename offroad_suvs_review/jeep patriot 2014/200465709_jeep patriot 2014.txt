Funny story - While waiting for a Ford Torneo from Spain, my little Chrysler broke down - expensively.

Had to cancel the order, forfeit the deposit and look for a new vehicle.
The wife said she wouldn't mind going back to a Jeep again, so there we are.

Read the negative reviews (from professionals) and the positive reviews (from owners) and found nothing to put me off - except a growing skepticism of professionals.
They were wrong on every count!

The salesman actually finagled a discount to rebate the $500 deposit, after I agreed to buy and here we are!
