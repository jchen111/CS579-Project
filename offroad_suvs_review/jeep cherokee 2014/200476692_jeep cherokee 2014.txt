After test driving almost every Ford SUV my back was killing me. This car stopped the pain on the test drive. I have read about the programming problem on the early 2014s. Mine is August 2013 but have had not a bit of trouble. Sometimes the tranny thinks too much when deciding gears but most of the time it is smooth. A pure joy on a long trip and I can drive for hours. The interior is well crafted and the car looks more expensive than it was. I have the six cylinder and get a a hard 32 mpg on the highway with 27 around town. I will achieve 110 mph rather quickly. You never get to the ninth gear. I am glad I bought it.

I started reading Edmunds.com's reviews a while ago, deciding between Mazda CX-5 & Cherokee, i am happy with my choice, is super comfortable and full of details as they claim, i switched from Jeep Liberty (3.7 V6) to the V4 and mileage is great, granted is that the V4 does not performs nor sounds as my old V6 did but my main concern was gas mileage so to me is a fair trade, tested the VW Tiguan Turbo and seems a more powerful V4 than Cherokee but overall car is no comparison at all. If you are looking for super performance probably the V6 will respond better to that need, design which seemed hideous on pictures quite frankly grows in me easy and love that sets it apart.

Aside from the past 5 years I have always had a Jeep in my life.
I let go of my Grand Cherokee due to gas mileage, so when this new Cherokee came out I was excited.
It has not disappointed!
I have the V6 Latitude.
The pick up is great, and I'm averaging 29 mpg on the highway and about 24 in the city.
I drive in heavy traffic a lot, so that is very good.
The 4 cyl car I just got rid of was only getting 20 mpg.
It is comfortable, fun to drive, and a beautiful vehicle!
My only complaint is the back of it is kind of ugly.
I feel like the Jeep logo should be bigger or something.
It just looks like something is missing.
I didn't like the front end at first, but it's really grown on me.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very pleased. Gas mileage has gone from 16 mpg to 27.5 mpg on the same route. Did not need 4wd or Awd . Happy with the performance of 2.4 engine. I don't mind how the 9 speed transmission works to maximize efficiency.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purchased a 2014 Latitude V6 with the 8.4A screen, added the Nav upgrade and the 9 speaker/sub/amp option.
Also splurged for the V6.

This was purchased for my teenage daughter, so when shopping for a small/mid SUV, coolness was definitely at the top of the list.
This was the only SUV that she liked and we looked at the Escape, CRV, Rogue, Rav4, CX-5.
In her eyes, none of them matched the design or styling that appealed to my teenager.




I was a little disappointed that the only way to get a rearview camera, garage door buttons and a n auto-dimming rearview mirror was to upgrade to a $2000 package.
I remember when these were standard features on a mid-level trim vehicle.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I purchased this vehicle a couple weeks back and I already have near 2000 miles on the vehicle. This past week I drove it to West Virginia from Georgia. Three adults and a fully packed cab, I still managed to get around 30 to 31 mpg on the highway. Handled exceptionally well in snow and dry land. Jeep did a great job with the interior design not to mention the comfort. The stitching seems high quality as well as everything about the vehicle. I have the factory base sound system and it seems to sound just as good as the upgraded speakers. The center console display is very easy to manage and is well placed. I am very pleased with the overall performance of the vehicle. Highly recommend it.
