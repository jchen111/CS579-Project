I needed a mid-size family SUV and did a ton of research. I opted for a fully loaded Cherokee Limited with luxury/convenience/UConnect/V6 package. This is the only vehicle in its class where I really liked the blend of exterior and interior design. The ride is very comfortable, ventilated seats work like a charm especially since I live in Phoenix and the temperatures are 100+ degrees six months out of the year. The dash board is simple yet offers a ton of features and is veary easy to use. The navigation is excellent, satellite radio, all that. I loaded all my music on a 64GB SD card.

I recently purchased a Limited V6 with the Tow Package, Technology Group, & the Luxury Group.
My wife and I love this vehicle.
It is very comfortable and has plenty of power.
The 9-speed transmission is smooth, but does take a little getting used to because the shifts happen at smaller intervals than what you expect for a 5 or 6 speed transmission.
The ventilated seats are slightly more comfortable than the standard seats - they feel a little like the Grand Cherokee's seats.
The vehicle is quiet & well built. The tecnology group works well.
On the highway it averages 28.5 mpg & in mixed driving is averages 22.5 mpg.
The cockpit is similar to a 2014 Grand Cherokee, but smaller overall.
