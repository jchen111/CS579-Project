I just picked
up a 2013 trail edition.
 I paid extra for Nitto Terra Grappler ATs as I've had so many problems in the past with the standard HTs that come with all 4Runners.
 I realize that most folks don't off-road but we do a few times a year.
 I traded in a 2011 trail which ran perfectly.
 This should be exactly the same but it does feel a little different with shift points and throttle response.
