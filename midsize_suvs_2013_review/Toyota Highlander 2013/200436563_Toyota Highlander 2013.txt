I love the look and feel of my Toyota Highlander and it is a pleasant ride until you try to use the Entune radio system. The HD radio is awful, constantly goes in and out, the satellite radio constantly loses reception and the GPS system leaves a lot to be desired. I am so disappointed with this system, I am starting to regret paying top dollar for a limited model. I will need to replace this system to save my sanity.

Got my Highlander Limited in December, and so far I love it. It was change coming from a luxury brand but the trade-offs were totally worth it.

I purchased the Highlander mainly to transport my family (2 and 4 legged) and still have some room left over. I have been able to do so with no issues.

The ride is fantastic and the gas mileage is actually pretty good. I took it on a 1500mi round trip expedition over the holidays and on the first day I filled up twice, which was surprising for a full sized SUV. On the way back, the weather sucked (snow) and I was in 4WD most of the way, however I only filled up three times.

Just bought this vehicle with rear ent. sys and was extremely disappointed to find that Toyota decided to apparently use a new radio this year that is not connected to the rear entertainment system.
Audio for movies is available through the included wireless headphones or you have to use an aftermarket solution like a bluetooth connection (not provided) or run a manual cable from one of the headphone jacks of the ent. system to the auxillary jack on the radio which should work in theory.
Considering Toyota is still charging a premium price for the Rear Entertainment System, and the dealers are not even aware that the sound is not avbl thru the speakers, I wanted to warn potential buyers.
