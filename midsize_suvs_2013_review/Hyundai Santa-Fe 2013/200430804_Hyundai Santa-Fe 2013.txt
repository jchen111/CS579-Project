Bought 2013 in January 2014. One week later heard knocking in the engine, took it to dealer was told that the GDI engines make this noise, normal. 2 weeks later took it back as knocking is not normal and there has been numerous reported engine failures with same noise, vehicle throws random emission codes which there is a tsb for but not all dealers know this so I have to put up with a defective SF. I loved it at first but that ended within 3 weeks. I think the 6 cylinders are more reliable than the 4's.

Bought the car in early 2013, we drive it weekly on the weekends. Loved it until last 2 months ago when we took a long trip in it. It started to surge on acceleration and sometimes fall on its face. Took to dealer and they were unable to reproduce. It gets worse the more we drive it. am now afraid to take a long trip in it. Have driven only a few times since back from dealer. Probably will trade soon as soon as I figure what to try next. Bought a Silverado 2013 this year also and love it, have 12000 miles on it with no issues.

We purchased a 2013 Sport 2.0 Turbo Oct 2012 and have only put on 4000 miles since then because of the poor steering.
Picked it up on a Friday night and was back on Saturday,could not drive it on highway and keep it between the lines.
Have had it back 6 times, adjusted the alignment, flashed the computer and even put in a new steering column and still have the problem.
Filed under the Lemon law and have been going through the process for 4 months.
Have to go through the BBB auto line before the state. BBB is funded by the auto industry, just found out our claim was rejected, even after the arbitrator had an expert driver do the report.
DON'T BUY WITHOUT DRIVING ON HIGHWAY,WORST DRIVE.

We purchased our Santa Fe in Jan 2013 and have had many issues with it. The steering is terrible and apparently nothing can be done. We have had 2 alignments already but it has not helped how the vehicle wanders and pulls.We had to have transmission replaced at 4,800 km and there was a recall on the back up sensors that could short out and cause a fire. At 5,200 km it is experiencing stalling and rough running issues as well as check gas cap light. Not impressed with hyundai refusing to pay for towing over 100 km since we do live in rural Alberta and closest dealership is over 100 km away.I have been left stranded by this so called new vehicle.I have lost confidence and now afraid to drive .

I recently hit 3,200 miles on my 2.0T with front wheel drive.
I've noticed some strange issues with the fuel gauge, and after some research on various message boards, the issue is very common.


The dash display of the Santa Fes includes digital readouts that show you your average MPG on your current tank of gas ,
your estimated range (how far you can travel until you need more gas), and a bar composed of little "bricks" that shows you how much gas you have left.
The bricks disappear as your gas tank empties.


Until Hyundai fixes whatever is wrong with them, expect wildly inaccurate readings.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had the car for 2 weeks.
The steering can be a little scary until you get used to it.
Other than that it is a really nice car.
Lots of pep, comfortable ride and 22.8 MPG.

This isn't a review about mechanical issues since it's too new to tell.


I've had my new Santa Fe 2.0T (FWD, base package, no frills) for a couple of weeks now.
I love it.
It is a comfortable, quiet, fun car to drive.
The 270+ hp turbo engine has no problem pushing up the steep inclines of the Texas hill country.
It doesn't even blink.
You'll take a bit of a hit on gas mileage over the non-turbo model, but it's worth it.
The non-turbos are just sluggish.


The interior is very comfortable, has great looking trim, and the standard options on the base package are impressive.
Heat seaters, power everything, bluetooth, all of the things you want.

I come from a family very loyal to Toyotas and Hondas, but even I have to agree that today the South Koreans easily win on styling
and features, and are barely a notch below the two Japanese heavyweights in terms of reliability.

I purchased my Santa Fe 2.0T FWD about a month ago after extensive research.
Very pleased with the purchase overall.
Can't beat the value and it is true that this thing looks, feels, and drives like a European car.
No surprise -- the chief design engineer was hired away from BMW and formerly designed the X5.
I do mostly city driving on it and still have my second car, but so far so good.
Gas mileage at 20mpg is terrible considering I don't drive aggressively.

Great car,fun to drive. Gas gauge is notoriously inaccurate

Bought the 2.0T after an extensive search and reading reviews. Test drove the 2013 Equinox, Grand Cherokee, Highlander, RDX, Pathfinder, and Edge and Escape. All were good vehicles but the 2.0T was the most impressive - size, space, speed, gas mileage, amenities, looks and at a decent price. Out the box the 2.0T is an excellent redesign. I am getting about 24 mpg combined after about 700 miles but my goal is to get closer to or exceed the EPA estimated 27 mpg by playing more with the ECO setting. Took a road trip of about 500 miles last weekend and the 2.0T never struggled (no whining at all) when going up hills or passing vehicles going up hills at 75 -80 mphÂ…I was thoroughly impressed.
