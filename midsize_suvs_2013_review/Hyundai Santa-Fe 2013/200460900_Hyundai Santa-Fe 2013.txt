Pretty good vehicle. We are happy with the design and appearance so far. Still breaking it in, so can't give you an estimate on the gas mileage that is valid, nor how it agrees with the manufacturer, but so far, city driving has given us 18-20 mpg. The car has plenty of power, if you feel you need more, then you should get a V-8 or a sports car......this car is plenty good and gives power when needed, and decent fuel consumption. Third row seat is no good for anyone taller than 5' 10" - unless you are driving a basketball team, someone will be shorter, and those people can survive on even longer trips. I am 6' 4" and the first 2 rows have plenty of room. The panoramic roof is awesome!

First cross over I've ever owned always had SUVs.
So far I love it, very classy,comfortable, snappy!
I hope it is everything I am expecting.

My wife and I just purchased the 6 seat Santa Fe 2013 that arrived last week. We had looked at the sport but waited on the larger model. So far we are pleased with the car, the appearance and technology are great.

We have not had much time to road test it but have encountered a problem, the passenger side floor was wet after a day on road with the AC on, there was also a little water on the driver side. The dealer was closed and we are dropping it off today, no idea if this is related to the AC drain or evaporator yet.
Not happy with the idea that much water was in the cab for at least a day, could cause rust and mold. 
I will post after we find out what happened
