It was a great car, until it hit 2 years old, and 30,000 KM (~18,000 miles). A piston broke in the engine, and the engine completely failed. What is worse, is the Warranty department balked on replacing the engine as per the service managers request. Eventually they agreed to a short block replacement and a few peripherals. Even that took nearly 2 weeks for approval, and I have little confidence this will be a long term fix. No rental car offered, and no explanation or apology. Still waiting for car to be fixed, as parts have to be shipped in. Not impressed. It is my second Hyundai, and now my last.

Bought Santa Fe 2.0T in July to replace a much loved 2002 CRV.
Thus far have found the car to be very fun to drive, comfortable at highway speeds, and the perfect size for driving around town.
Only time will tell regarding reliability and dealer service.
I have not had any complaints with the steering (as others have reported), and the 2.0T has plenty of power even in the ECO mode.
My only complaint is the blind spot created by the severely angled rear windows.
They seem to have sacrificed clear sight lines for styling.

We have had our Santa Fe for a month now, so far so good. Steering takes a little getting used to. But I find the that on low beams, the lights make a line that is very anoying when driving on the highway. As anyone noticed this problem, if so how can it be fixed.
The vehicle is brand new to us, never driven a Hyundai before always GM's which were very good.

I love the car for the most part, I go commute to and from school as well as work and outings with family and friends. In mixed driving the computer shows an average ranging from 24.5 to 27.0 MPG with the AWD turbo. Not sure how accurate that is given what the dealer said it should be getting HWY, plus the car always states about 330 miles until empty with a full tank. Took a 300 mile trip and only used half a tank, not complaining though. Only issue is servicing the vehicle, Hyundai service always has something else to blame. I installed HIDs and a SUB 3 months ago, 2 days ago an Engine Control System warning comes on, Hyundai blames the after market parts, says its an electrical spike.
