An extremely solid, truck-based SUV.
Purchased new in 2013.
 After 13-months now has 20k miles and it's only been to the shop for oil changes.


Ride is better than most trucks, but the build is solid and body stiffness is superb.
Seats are quite comfortable, as are heater/AC and the overall ride.
My wife -- the ultimate judge of comfort, with a bad back -- has no problem taking road trips in this vehicle.

I mostly use this as a commuter vehicle, but occasionally haul stuff or go camping off-road.
Average 21.3 MPG in combo city/highway.
Engine is more than adequate.

It's the perfect vehicle for my needs.
A well-engineered, reliable ride.

This is my 2nd 4Runner.
My last 4Runner was old and I wanted a new, reliable vehicle for my daughter and me
as I was worried I would start having problems.
New 4Runner is not reliable.
I really, really don't like this vehicle at all.
I have had it since Aug.
Every time something hits the windshield, it cracks.
It's cracked 3 times since Aug.
Major hassle to get it fixed every time it breaks and it seems like it always breaks.
Prior to this vehicle, I have replaced 1 windshield.
Also had a major electrical failure, which put it in the shop for 5 days.
Still doesn't seem right but the techs say it's fine.
Waiting for it to break again.
 It shifts totally weird.
 I don't recommend

in cold climate, it takes unreasonably long for the engine to get into normal operating range. (about 8 miles of driving)
the interior heater is weak even at the max and takes very long to warm up the interior.

Suspension is hard when driving over bumps and potholes, not good for the spine

running boards are useless for a taller person as they are in the way

front dives and rear moves up under hard breaking

engine is loud and sounds rough around 2500rpm

sheet metal is very thin, waves can be seen on the hood when going through car wash dryer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Storage (lack), the roof rack is 43 inches long.
Short for transporting a kayak.
Interior has no small storage areas.
A small tool box or cross lug wrench would have to be left loose in the back.
Console is one large deep box, just dump everything in there and take 15 mins to find something.
I made a second shelf with another divider.

Spare- on a steel wheel.
Either I buy a another alloy wheel or let a new tire go to waste.
Can't be put into normal rotation. 
Gas mileage- 190 miles local city driving 13.6 mpg. Driving 70-75 mph 21.2 mpg. 70-75 mph mountainous roads 18.5 mpg, 60-65 mpg 22.8 mpg.
At 1k miles can't comment on quality or reliability. 
Basic model is nicely equipped.
