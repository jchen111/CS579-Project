When I bought the 2013 Pathfinders, like any new owner I was thrilled. . Unfortunately there were a few things that I id not understand. So when my pathfinder began shuttering and shaking at 900 miles, I contacted customer service who referred me to the local dealership, who with all of there up-to-date computer diagnostic could not fit the problem. Fortunately, Nissan already understood the problem before I bought the car. "Faulty Software & the Service Campaign" Whereby the owner brings in the vehicle multiple times exhibiting the same problem, and nissan replaces the entire drivetrain. Thats right. . Faulty software that can not be changed, that ends up damaging the CVT on its own. .

I owned so many Nissan cars, trucks and suv's but I was so disappointed with 2013 Pathfinder. I bought my 2013 Pathfinder SV at first I was enjoying it but after I hit more than 1,000 miles it started shuddering and losing power. All the moulding under the door became loose and when I'm driving on the freeway it was vibrating so hard that the sound inside the cabin is so annoying. I brought it back to the dealer for them to fix the shuddering and losing power but the mechanic said "there's nothing wrong with. After three months of driving it I finally trade it in for the Titan which I should have bought in the first place.....

The shudder got to bad and Nissan answers phone in Manila, Philipines and stalls forever and wears you down. Dealer network very poor in our area, and traded off now because the market is all ready getting the buy backs on the market and values are falling fast.
Nissan should do a recall but will not do so until forced

Purchased on 2-18-13 the suv drives and handles well.
The vehicle is roomy inside and not too large on the outside. Averages about 25 mpg at 70 mph and over 26 at 55-60 mph.
Expect 20-21 mpg in local driving.
 Well pleased with the Pathfinder except for transmission problems.

 On slow acceleration, 20 to 25 mph,the transmission will shutter/shake.
The problem repeats at about 40 mph.
On 4-17-13, the Nissan dealer, who was very helpful, advised Nissan is aware of the problem but has no fix at this time.
A Nissan Service Bulletin, dated Jan '13, did NOT fix the transmission! Hope the repair comes soon as I fear the transmission will fail while traveling.

My husband and I bought a 2013 Pathfinder 3 weeks ago and our vehicle has been in the shop twice! First time Feb. 6th due to our vehicle jerking back and forth while we were driving with our kids in the vehicle. At first Nissan said they couldn't figure out whats wrong then they said it was a sensor and it was fixed. My kids and I have been sick so we didn't drive the car again until Feb. 10th in which the vehicle again was jerking back and forth and now making a very loud knocking sound. Took the vehicle again to Nissan today (Feb. 11th)
and it has been there since 9:30 a.m. just to be told "we don't see anything wrong with it" 6 hours later ..... Never again will I buy NISSAN!
