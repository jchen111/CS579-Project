I now have returned my 2013 Honda Pilot for repair for the fourth time in 10 months for the same vibration issue. After taking the service manager for a 50 mile road trip, he said the vibration was the worst he had experienced. After 3 days I have been advised that all the 2013 Honda Pilots have a similar vibration. How this suddenly happened, I do not know. Honda response is that this is a "Normal Vibration". I have never heard of such Bull. This has to be the worst vehicle I have ever owned and now Honda is offering NO help on this issue.

i purchased a 2013 Honda Pilot in December 2012. The follolwing day i reported a vibration, which service department said was a wheel weight. After leaving the vehicle for 3 days the SD (service department) replaced a front motor mount which was to resolve the problem. No problem solved, Still vibrating. Two weeks later I returned the vehicle for 3 more days. SD replaced the rear motor mount. Still vibrates.
After trying to repair the vehice 2 times with no success Honda Customer Service calls it a " Normal vibration".Now that Honda Engineering can't resolve the vibration issue the SD calls it a "Characteristic of the vehicle". The SD informed me that all the 2013 Pilot 2WD have a vibration
