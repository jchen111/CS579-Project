While the Sorento is comfortable, quiet, quick, and well appointed, the poor gas mileage is a deal breaker! If we had known what it was going to get, which is about 23mpg's at best on highway, we never would've bought it. The number they gave at the dealership was 32mpg, which now, after being sued, they have adjusted to 30, which puts the Sorento below competitors instead of ahead. But we can't even get close to 30 ever!! Our Volvo gets exactly what it says on the sticker no matter the driving conditions. Don't be fooled! If you want it for other reasons, go ahead. But don't think they are competitive with Honda, Toyota, or others in this class. They continue to lie. It seems criminal.

I owned a 2004 Kia Amanti and traded it in for a 2010 Chevy Equinox...loved the gas milage, but gave up too many features I enjoyed in my Kia...so thanks to the special the dealer had I was able to trade in my Chevy for the 2013 Kia Sorento EX...love it...gained all the luxury I was missing and added the peace of mind of the Kia warranty.
Gas milage has been great my first tank of gas I averaged 28 mpg which was a mixture of Highway and City miles.
 Love the bluetooth link to my iPhone and the UVO system is awesome.
Lots of room for driver over 6'2" with plenty of room for back seat passengers....I am so glad I am no longer a Government Motors owner and back in a Kia made in America. :)
