We bought a 2012 SX AWD for the wife last year. We love that car so much we bought another one for me. I use it for work everyday so I went with the GDI for better gas mileage. I'm getting between 24 and 25 combined with a couple hundred pounds of tools and parts in it. The acceleration is peppy and more than adequate. The 6 speed shifts smoothly and effortlessly. Handling is great, a very good turning radius so it handles like a smaller car. The SX has 25000 miles on it and mine has 1000 and we've had no problems out of either of them. I am probably a Kia customer for life now.

Got your Attention, I hope so . 2.4 AWD w/ 9000miles convenience package. Heres the deal, this car runs and drives great. Road noise I place in the top ten for quiet. Handling is very good, I like firm but nibble.
The transmission while in the ECO mode hunts more than my golden retriever, I thought my toyota shifted a lot, trying to keep that ECO light on is a trick but doable why I dont know. The beige interior stains very easily DO NOT drop a french fry. The fuel mileage indicator on the dash says what I thinks its supposed to 18-20city 26-29 on the highway. With a average of 22.5 to24.

We have had our Sorento for a few days now. All i can say is, don't hesitate, buy this SUV.
I love it, we have 4 kids and the 3rd row seat is very nice.
I was a little nervous having a 4 cyl. in a Mid sized SUV but all the worries were quickly squashed.
I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about when they said the 4 cyl Sorento was under powered, it's not.
Try it for your self you'll be impressed.
The ride is very smooth, the seats are comfy and overall it's just a very good looking SUV.
Oh, the sound system is awesome!
The only thing they should change, is to put a luggage rack on all models.
I hope this helps someone, you wont be disappointed.

This model with the smaller 4 cy engine is SERIOUSLY UNDERPOWERED. I took my first long trip with it last weekend and it got scary a couple of times.
When I needed get up and go it wasn't there. Get the larger 4 cy or a .6
Also it doesn't take the bumps very well..very rough ride on moderately bumpy roads. I'm already thinking of getting rid of it and I don't have 3000 miles on it yet.
