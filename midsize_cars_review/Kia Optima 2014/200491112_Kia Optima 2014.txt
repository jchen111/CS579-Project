Have had my 14 Optima LX with the
convenience package for a month now and I still smile every time I sit in it. Was not looking to buy a mid size sedan but loved it as soon as I took the first test drive. Steering could be a little stiffer and provide a bit of feedback, and the front passenger seat is way to low without the power upgrade. Have a couple of friends who don't like not being able to see over the dashboard when riding with me. Mileage could be better, but for a mid size car with a trunk I could sleep in its not bad at all. Over all a great car for the price when I walk up to it in a parking lot I still cant believe its a KIA.

I bought my Optima in late May of this year and have been in love with it ever since. I went with an LX model but opted to get the convenience package for the back up camera. With any car though here will be issues and the 2014 Optima has a big steering issue. Everyone I talk with agrees that they don't have control of their car at high speeds and that the slightest correction to the steering grows the car too fast and far to the other side of the lane. I'm also not a huge fan of the grey and beige options as well as the gas mileage.

This is my wife's driver. We have had several BMYW 7's, Jaguar XJ's, and two Audi A6's.

At one third the price this thing gives them all a run for the money IMHO.

I am a guy that has bought eight new Porsches and i am amazed that Kia can make a car of this quality and deliver it at that price.

At this price point, it is definitely the best car out there.

Going on one month now for the 2014 LX. The car is half the price of the Lexus I used to own and the ride is better, its quieter, the 4 cyl gives me all the power I can use not to mention the gas mileage, warranty, all in a beautiful car.
I cannot believe they build this great car for the low price.
