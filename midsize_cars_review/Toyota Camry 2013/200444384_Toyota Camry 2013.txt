This is our 2nd Toyota Camry, the first being a 2004 with 150k and still running well.
The 2013 Toyota Camry has had issues with the radio having lots of static when using the rear defrost. Last winter the dealer looked at this and did not believe it was an issue however you only seem to notice it in the cooler months when using the rear defrost.
Have any other 2013 Toyota Camry customers experienced that issue?

This is my third Camry and will be my last. The heat on this car takes 20 minutes to warm up, By the time it does I am at work. I was told this is standard
for this car. The car has the WORST pickup ever. I can't even accelerate quickly if I need to get out of the way. I was told this is due to the econo button that cannot be shut off. It's cheaply made the fabric seats stain easily and when trying to clean water marks are left behind. Toyota refused to fix any of my problems. Today I went to the drive through and all my windows were frozen stuck, Between the lack of heat and no pick up and now the window problem I feel like I am driving around in a 15 year old car.

I purchased a brand new 2013 Toyota Camry 2 months ago. The car keeps stalling out even while driving on a highway. I have almost been involved in a serious accident as a result. Toyota can't seem to get to the bottom of this matter. In the interim I am very frustrated as I am getting the run around between the manufacturer and the dealer. I plan on pursuing NJ Lemon Law in attempt to have my car replaced.

Cheap looking "stick on" middle dashboard: (Where the radio/gps and the cd area), The upper deck interior/roof looks cheap and noise(hollow inside) and built from a cheap material (Compare to my Japanese built in 2003 4runner..which solid and looks classy). Interior/Door sides again looks cheap, Back mid-console box looks cheap and no ventilation goes out to the rear passengers. Overall texture of the interior looks down graded to all of my Toyota that I have owned in the past! Disappointed! GAS MILEAGE: Not as what it said in the sticker (25/35..combined 28mpg)..So far only 22.4MPG!!

I traded a 2005 Camry LE for the new 2013 Camry LE.
Performance is about the same with the 4 cyl. automatic.
Very responsive and I expect that the highway mileage should be about the same as experienced with the 2005, around 35 mpg.
The seats are more comfortable than the 2005 - a major improvement.
One very serious shortcoming is that there is NO way to lock the trunk.
The valet key allows you to lock the glove compartment, but if you are traveling and have valuables in the trunk there is no way to protect them from theft if you leave the car in a valet parking lot, service provider or anywhere where the vehicle will be left in someone else's care.
I consider this a serious oversight.
