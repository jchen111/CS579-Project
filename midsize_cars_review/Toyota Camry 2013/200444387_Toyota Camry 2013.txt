Purchased the Camry SE 3.5 Fully Loaded in November 2013. I test drove many other vehicles before making a decision on the Camry SE.
Prior to buying the Camry I drove 2003 Honda Accord that was bought new ended putting 140k. The Honda was in perfect mechanical condition but decided it was time to buy a newer car that had updated comfort features and the latest technology.
After all the research and test driving I chose the Camry because you get more for less.
The Toyota Care and roadside assistance sealed the deal.
MPG is great considering it's the 3.5

I've owned my Camry SE V6 with premium package for three months. Can't be
happier. The car is quiet and accelerates fast, can't believe it coonsumes less fuel than my traded-in 2005 I4 hyundai sonata. Like the BSM and backup crossover warning feature, really useful.

I guess it depends on what you are looking for...I love the car and I believe compared to anything else out there the Camry is best in class with a qualification. 1). I don't like plastic everywhere. But if the plastic outlasts the components of competitors who cares?

Otherwise, I purchased my Camry because it was practical, fun, fast, reliable, economical, entertaining, and cool. While other competitors may have less plastic, their cars don't last as long. I am a little concerned about the consumer reports issue, but thus far, my Camry is aces. I have put 40k on it in 1.5 years and it gets over 32 easy on the highway! At 80 mph the tach reads about 2050 or thereabouts!

The title says it all - this car is an excellent value.
It rides well, handles decently, is comfortable, has a few cool features, is sturdily constructed, gets acceptable fuel economy (particularly considering the performance), and is roomy.
It does all of the important things well or well enough, with no major flaws and zero irritants.
Plus, in SE V-6 trim, the engine supplies a few thrills and the car handles/steers well enough to keep up when you want to do more than commute.
Bottomline, it ain't a sports sedan, and it ain't a luxury car, either.
But for what the SE V-6 is and for what Toyota charges for it, it really is the best thing out there.

My 2013 SE V6 Camry is perfect!Better than my X5 BMW that sucks a lot of gas.

Over 3,000km (1,875mi) so far and very happy with my choice. Not a perfect car but it does everything well for its segment at a great price. Tighter handling, better interior materials and dashboard design would be nice but this is a mid-sized family sedan for value minded customers, not BMW 5 series and Toyota did a good job with this generation. I haven't had popping roof noise, AC odor and rattling dashboard issues that some drivers complained about. V6 has a very generous amount of power and most people would be perfectly fine with I4. Transmission shifts smoothly. Cabin is very quiet on Michelin tires. Ride comfort is great. I highly recommend the SE trim.

I bought a 2013 Camry.
I and all passengers bump our heads on the handle bar above the seats in all seats.
I am only 5'3 so it is not a height issue.
Can not put a baby seat in back seat and put anybody but a short person in the drivers or passengers side upfront because of the length of the vehicle.
Do not like entune navigation system!
Everytime I plug up my phone to charge, it starts itunes with the very first song alphabetically on my playlist.
Research shows this can not be fixed. I have to fumble on the touchscreen to turn it off and back on the radio. If you turn of the entune bluetooth for the itune issue you can't make calls obviously. Seat adjustment is also excessively slow!
