I've had this car for just over one year, but have already put 41k miles on it.
Had a very small problem early (round 3k miles), where the passenger seatbelt light came on.
Dealer fixed it and I've had no problems since.
I'm averaging 41mpg (up and down hills/mountains) commuting to work, and I've gotten as high as 55mpg on "normal" trips.
MPG under city conditions not as good (avg maybe 32-36), but still not bad.
The more you stay on the highway, the better your mpg.
Good leg and shoulder room for tall people (I'm 6'3).
Seats could be a little more comfortable, but maybe it's because I sit there for longer periods.

Purchased this car in March 2013 after starting new job with longer commute (about 80 miles a day). Have been impressed with MPG's for this car. My overall average for the car has been almost 45 mpg. I have found the mpg display in car to be about 2-3 miles off (i.e. shows 49, in reality 46-47 when checking at fill up). The car is comfortable to drive, handling is reasonable (it's no sports car but at same time it's not a Buick from the 1990's either). The interior materials are above average. The navigation system is OK but lags behind the latest technology. The DSG transmission is quick, the only complaint is when you stop and suddenly accelerate, it can stumble for a second or two.

I just picked up a new 2013 TDI Passat with the automatic. Here's my impression after the first few hundred miles.

I discovered motor sports in the late 1960s. Back in the day I was a drag racing fan and lover of Detroit muscle. Budget constraints got me into riding and racing motorcycles and that changed my priorities for a car. I get my performance rush from bikes and airplanes. Cars have a different mission, one that requires reasonable power, solid handing and enough comfort to drive for hours.

My Dodge dualie turned me on to diesels. when a friend gave me a ride in his TDI Jetta, I appreciated it's quiet torque and efficiency. That led me to buy a Passat SEL with the automatic.

LOVE this car so much! Amazing gas mileage that gets better as the engine gets broken in, and it's super roomy! People sit behind my 6'3 boyfriend and they still have tons of space in the back. Everyone has commented that it rides really smooth as well. People ask, "This is a Volkswagon? WOW! This is super nice!" This car has exceeded my expectations, and I find myself volunteering to drive everywhere because it's so much fun.

I am extremely thorough in my research and very picky when it comes to the car I want.
I am a college student; however travel 25,000-30,000 a year for my job as an Ice hockey referee; I travel the midwest and east coast.
This car thus far is awesome on road trips.
Quiet, smooth, powerful tdi engine.
3 driving modes make this awesome to drive, while I am getting 43 mpg highway and 30 mpg city (not babying it @75 on the highway).
I did replace the awful hankook tires with Continental extreme contact dws.
The build design is great and you can tell the high quality, just watch for the rattles in which the dealer quickly fixed.
If you want a fun to drive sedan with awesome mpg get this!

I don't see many Passats where I live, so people do a double-take when they see it. Despite what critics think of its understated styling, most of the people that see mine are impressed by its looks and clean lines. I just don't think it photographs well though unless you know how to work the clean lines. The diesel's excellent fuel mileage, German-driving feel, and cavernous rear interior space are what sold us on the TDI SE Passat. It's great for our family of 5, almost negates the need for a larger crossover SUV.
Free satellite radio for 90 days and 3 years free preventative maintenance also adds some value.
