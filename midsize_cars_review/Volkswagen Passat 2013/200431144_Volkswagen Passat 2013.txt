My wife @ I were in the market of purchasing a family sedan and ended up choosing the Passat SE.
At first, it was a toss up who loved the car more-my wife or kids.
The stereo system is awesome-the sunroof w/ its variable selections is right on, the way it handles a curve in the road or tight turns is very impressive and the leather seats are extremely comfy.
At 29,000 miles the brakes started making that squeaking sound(rotors/pads required replacement) headlights are on recall from VW, the paint chips very easily and random computer messages keep popping up on the dash for no apparent reason.
Just today the battery went dead and needs replacing. Trading it in on 2014 Ford Fusion SE!!!

First Volkswagen product purchase...absolutely flawless car. Very smooth and Quiet, excellent sound system. Looks larger than it is...same size as Honda Accord....too "vanilla". Drove Ford
Fusion, "felt sloppy" and cumbersome. This car
is a great value. And you should be able to negotiate the MSRP with 10% off. No longer use
Costco program....you can do better yourself,
as Costco is just another"middle man".
