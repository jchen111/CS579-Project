After driving for a year and 20k miles here's my take on the Passat TDI.
It takes bumps like a pickup truck, corners like a boat, and the technology of a car from 1990. Every time it rains the water rolls off of the roof and into the car when getting in/out or stopping at a drive-through.
Is there anything good about this car?????
Yes, the amount of space for passengers and luggage is enormous and I get the same milage as all those hybrids but I don't have to worry about a $7K battery swap in a few years.
Bottom line buy if you're looking for space mad mileage.
Plenty of other choices if tech or performance is higher on your list.

i'm not a gear head but i like cars.
I've owned a Lexus LX470, 330, AUdi TT, Dodge Stealth, Dodge Durango, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Mercedes C260, couple of Jeep Grand Cherokees, 2 Jetta TDI's and a 2006 Passat TDI.
I absolutely love it.
Drives great, use it without snow tires in Maine winter, drive 35000 miles a year, getting 49mpg highway regularly, looks great, great fit and finish, great sound system.
I've already put 70,000 miles on it (65,000 miles on original equipment Continental all seasons).
I drove this entire horrible Maine winter with those tires and 50,000 miles on them.
This is easily better built than my wife's Mercede's C 260 (so much so that she wants one).

Volkswagon knows they have an issue with the Passat and they should do a recall.
The issue is with the fuel pump and the high compression.
They blame you the consumer and blame you for putting gasoline in a diesel engine. Pump goes then the injectors, watch out stay away.

I bought my 2013 Passat SE-TDI new in April 2013. I've put 16,000 miles on it since then. My daily commute is 35 mostly highway miles. We've taken the car on week-long road trips (from D.C. area) to Charleston, SC; Cleveland; Buffalo; and NYC area. I average 37 mpg per tank in mixed highway/local driving. It's an excellent cruising car, although the seats are a bit hard. I haven't noticed the road noise problems others talk about. Haven't had a single mechanical problem since I bought it. To me, the design is attractive inside and out. I highly recommend this car.

A new billion dollar factory and still quality issues. My fuel door fell off in my hand! And to add insult to injury they told me that I had to pay to fix it because it was an "external influence!" And when I inquired as to what the external influence was the customer service representative replied, "Cold weather!" So I have to pay $300.00 to replace my fuel filter door because it got cold in Pennsylvania!

VW got the engine right. Great mileage, quiet operation, starts quickly in cold weather.
The DSG is responsive but expensive, it costs over $300.00 every 40,000 miles to service.

Too bad their lousy attention to details like designing a fuel door that will won't fall off.

My first vw I bought this car in July, 4400 miles and 2 trips from Asheville NC to Orlando later. about 560 miles one way I am very pleased overall. I average 30 Mpg city and 45 on the highway one tank was 51 Mpg. This car does every thing you can ask of it. Plenty of room power and great cruising range of 832 miles with 18.5 Gal tank. just be aware
Because of the Automated manual trans car will disengage and roll backwards on very steep hills. my Car will not lock from the outside unless
keyless remote is used.

Car was 26K OTD with Tax. More than one person thought I paid 40K. VW got this right.

I want to love this car but it's hard when the driver's seat and steering wheel are not centered with each other. VW Customer Care admits this is the way the car is made, due to the widening of the body, but without making corresponding adjustments to the steering system. Therefore, the wheel sits to the right of center. VW managed to move my seat 2mm to the right, which helped make it a little less drastic. My loaner Passat had the same problem. I SO WISH I had noticed on the test drive. As for the TDI, wow, it's awesome. But, this car may well be gone as soon as the warranty is up. If you're not OCD like me, then you will love this car. Also, 1 month in and been to shop for rattle fix.

We opted for the TDI SE with the sunroof and DSG. The DSG transmission is a must, one hand holding the coffee and no worries about shifting. Also the DSG is quicker in acceleration, the 6 speed manual have to tall gears and have a tendency to stall.

The interior is very roomy, specially the rear seats, I have friends 6'3" tall seating in the back fitting comfortably. The fuel compsuption is simply ridiculous, I went from Tucson to San Diego with a a little over half tank(420Miles), I average 43.8mpg with the A/C and the cruise set at 83 MPH. The interior is very well made and the ride is very quiet. It does 85mph@2500 rpm. We are filling every 3 plus weeks. Free maintenance for 3 years.

I just bought my Passat 2 weeks ago. My husband had been looking for us a new car and trade in our KIA Minivan with 191,000 mi. We travel. Was disappointed in the 3yr 36k mile warranty. Having a Kia was use to the 100K warranty. Shopped several dealerships and decided on the Passat TDI SE. Just to find the right color. Well found a dealer 1 hr away from us that offered a FREE Lifetime warranty on Engine and Transmission. Since we keep our cars a long time this was great. Well 2 weeks and 1000 miles first tank was 41 mpg city and hwy. Have noticed the 51+ on the display screen but we keep our mileages in a book.

Love it
Room Good Ride and Excellent quality inside and out. Will keep posing

Traded in my Acura TL for this, needed more interior room but still something 'fun' to drive and good mileage. Decided for the TDI, dealer's offer was too good to pass up ($24,800). Very pleased, highway mileage is consistently 50+, quiet cabin, and sport mode really pushes the car when I need it. Ergonomics are great, seats aren't deep buckets but still firm and supportive. Back seat is HUGE, both width and depth, easily fit 3 adults comfortably or two car seats. Trunk is equally massive, fits all my stuff for work plus a full size 2 child stroller. Also knowing my maintenance is covered for the next 3 years is great peace of mind.
