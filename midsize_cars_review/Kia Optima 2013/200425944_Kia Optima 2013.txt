Went shopping for a used Optima the minute I realized it was 'car time'.
Found a used 2013 with 44K on it, and almost dismissed it out of hand for high miles, until I drove it, then ...WOW!
Like it just rolled off factory floor. Loaded EX with ALL the bells and whistles.
Have had it for 7 months and another 6K, and I cant find the slightest flaw.
Getting about 24 MPG around town, and up to 38MPG on hwy, so I do NOT understand the MPG complaints I've read here.
Car drives like it's on rails, and very quiet.
My wife has the 2011 Sonata Limited so we're always comparing cars, and she'll admit, the Optima is the better of the 2. For the price, you can't beat it

the best gas mileage I get is 18 city and 27 on a trip.
the company and the dealer (courtesy kia
Altoona pa) will do nothing.
I would never buy another kia.

I'm almost 50 and have owned many cars...Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Volvo, Acura, and am probably a bit of a car snob.
I never would have thought I'd own a Kia, but had long been drawn to the exterior design for the fact that there's nothing else on the road that looks like it.
So, I went to the dealer for a closer look.
Wow!
Interior design is outstanding!
Quality is amazing, and more features than my loaded Acura TL had!
I'm seriously in love with this car... Beautiful, stylish, excellent fit and finish.
The steering is a little touchy, and took me a bit to get used to.
Otherwise, there's not a vehicle out there that delivers more bang for the buck than this bad boy.

I started off searching for a Mercedes and did not see one that had all of the features I wanted without breaking the bank. Then I spotted a gorgeous Infiniti that I liked very much but did not have all of the bell and whistles as the Kia Optima like rear seat warmers and the panoramic sunroof. Not to mention the Infiniti was at least 3 years older, with a partial warranty. After looking at the Optima there was no comparison to the amenities and the price was great compared to the type of vehicles that I was searching for. I was able to get everything I wanted in this vehicle without paying a fortune. This car is great it handles well, it looks good, and it looks better with tinted windows.

Kia should state true gas milage. They say 24 - 35. In reality it is more like 20-22 to 31-32.Stop lying KIA, you have a great car here except for your bloated MPG milage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't bought a new car since 1982 but after the repair bills on my last two BMW's, I decided to go this route.
The BMW repair center I used was close to work so I parked it and walked past the KIA dealership to work.
I kept looking at the Optima's as I walked by and thought they were beautiful sedans.
After my last $850 repair bill I decided to give them a test drive.
I didn't expect them to drive and ride as well as my 545i, and they didn't, but I was happily surprised at how well it did perform.
I have been averaging over 35 mpg on the highway so I am very happy.
I also enjoy the fact I can use regular gasoline instead of the premium that I had to use in my BMW.

I traded in a 2008 Honda Accord for a 2013 KIA Optima.
I am extremely happy with everything about this car.
There are so many bells and whistles.
It's comfortable and the panoramic sunroof is great.
My husband purchased this car for me and I love the Metal Copper color.
It's fun to drive.
KIA hit this one out of the ball park.

This car delivers. Everything that it says it does...it does. The power is quick, responsive and really makes the car fun to drive. It handles with the precision of a European counterpart.

I have been impressed with the features that are offered inside the cabin as well. 

I would have never pictured myself in a Korean car as I have been a Japanese owner all of my life. The quality and fit of the car have really sealed the deal for me. 

I am not sure if I could recommend a car more highly. 

Kia has been excellent
with all the maintenance and follow up. It has been better than expected.

I traded in my 2011 Kia Soul for a 2013 Kia Optima EX and even though its only been about a month, I can honestly say this car is HOT.
It certainly has more features for the price than any other car in its class, and the the gas mileage is slightly lower than what is posted, overall I love this car. I got the snow white pearl finish with the light grey leather interior. I added custom wheels and a wood dash, and the car is now on par with a Lexus for half the price. the icing on the cake was the other day when i was at the grocery store, and this guy pulls up in a supercharged dodge challenger, rolls down the window, and says "nice ride"
that made me smile for the rest of day!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now a proud owner for 1 year. Overall average mpg 24.0+. Great ride and I am amazed by the acceleration of this hot 4 cylinder! Interior finish is excellent and the leather is tops. I am still wondering how this KIA is so well priced that anyone would buy a Toyota! Thus far no mechanical or build problems at all. 

Cons: Only one! The steering wheel is a bit to "slick" to grip.
