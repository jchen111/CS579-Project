So i bought my 2013 Kia Opitma in October of 2013 and I just had to replace my engine this month. Took it to two different dealers and they couldnt diagnose the problem. Finally went to a dealer that could and they told me I needed a new engine. The car isnt even 6 months old and has about 10000 miles on it. Its a great looking car and fun to drive on the weekends. Customer service could be a lot better and helpful.

I test drove this car, a scion TC, and a Honda accord and the Optima was, in my opinion, the best of the three. With the features offered and the low price tag this car blew me away. I've had the car for 7 months now and have put 11,000 miles on it and I still love it. I have seen the other people saying that they do not get good gas mileage but on the country roads I get about 30mpg and in the city I still get a good 27mpg on the highway I usually average 35mpg. I have had no problems with the car and I definitely recommend it to someone looking for an amazing and gorgeous looking sedan with a low price tag.

Best investment I have4 made in a long time.

I think this car is great. Great handling, acceleration, love the interior and bluetooth, the exterior is sharp and aggressive. BUT the gas mileage is a turn off! Im averaging 26 mpg..on the high way! Ive tried everything. Tried cruse control, driving light footed and watching the instant mpg monitor....all of that with eco mode and still nothing!!! Its becoming very frustrating because first of all this is a 4 cylinder! My old lincoln ls (v8) could get that kind of mileage. Thank god Im leasing this car. Kia stop lying about you're mpg.

Like the car real well, runs great has plenty of power, smooth ride, comfortable seating. the only thing i am disappointed in is the gas mileage. The sticker rates it at 24 city 35 highway. I once checked it at about 19mpg everyday driving. On the highway going from birmingham to atlanta round trip I got about 30mpg. which is not too bad , but is about 5mpg below epa estimated mileage. So it seems that both the city and highway mileage falls about 5mpg short. Don't go by the estimated mpg on the odometer because it is not very accurate. It may say you are getting a few more miles per gallon than is true. I found when you check it at fill up with a calculater
it is less.

I bought it thinking I would get less than shown on mileage.
WRONG !!!
 After 1000 miles getting,
Interstate driving
cruising, 70 mph on flat ground,
a steady 36.7-.8 mpg.
Yesterday a 53 mile return trip driving Interstate Hwy with rolling hills, State Hwy with steep hills, 6 miles of rural blacktop road with high hills and and winding curves, stopping in small town to buy dinner, stopping at 4 stoplights . Average 34.7 mpg, average speed 49 mph for total trip . General driving trip to town driving 26 miles through steep hills on winding road and town driving, average 29.3 mpg. For anyone getting terrible mileage with this engine, try Star Tron add to clean water/crbn from fuel,
etc.

The key to this car is measuring the overall value in a car of this class.
Kia has done a great job with a car that has more than adequate performance, a host of standard features, a very roomy and stylish interior, striking looks and the best fuel economy of any car I've owned.
I've HAD it with paying for $4/Gal gas and getting 13 mpg's in SUV's and trucks etc.
Although I've never gotten 35 mpg as advertised, I have averaged 28.5 in mixed driving.
Quite good for a car of it's size and performance level.
The LX has all the features we wanted and kept the price very reasonable.
Is this the perfect car? No. (see suggested improvements)
However, it is quite good at just about everything.

I bought this car 7 months ago and I am so happy to drive and step into it every day. The looks are Drop dead Gorgeous. The comfort is similar to sitting in your living room. The interior is High-end and state of the art. 
The drive is smooth and luxurious and I feel as if I'm driving a $40,000 car.

Ok, typcially i am a SUV truck\guy.
I got this car based on gas mileage and looks.
It is like any other car, you drive it hard.. burns gas.. drive it nice.. it does pretty decent.. anything to me was better than 12-17mpg i was getting with my older suv.
Its roomy for 7 yr old triplets... driving is a pleasure even though im on the ground again.. even the passenger size has room for my 6.8 friend who fits in it.
Overall i am satisfied with it.
The dash is nice, performance feels right for a 4 banger... and gas when going from what i was to what i am ..awesome.. i mean.. if i get over 200 miles on a half tank.. and 400 on a full tank.. and im not the nicest of drivers.car is good for me

Don't know how heavy footed some of the reviewers are, but I'm averaging about 32.5mpg combined. My commute is 35 miles each way, about 1/3 suburban, 1/3 highway and 1/3 city. I regularly use cruise control on the highway, but do not use the ECO control (doesn't seem to help). I used to use my wife's Grand Cherokee on the weekends when I had my Honda Civic, but this one is too comfortable to give up on those 2 days.
