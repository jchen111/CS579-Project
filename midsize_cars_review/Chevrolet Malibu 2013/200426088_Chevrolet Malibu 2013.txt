After reading the professional reviews on this car I was hesitant to buy one. I took several mid size cars for a drive and actually found the Malibu to be quite comfortable and responsive, the price was also competitive. I have a little over 3000 miles on mine now and I am very glad I made that choice.

This car is fantastic in so many ways.
Just after purchase we took a trip up into the Arizona white mountains and the Malibu handled the climbs with ease.
My only complaints are that the car is a little jerky in shifting at lower speeds, the lip under the front bumper is very flimsy and has already fell apart, and the interior roof console where the built in garage door opener was pretty loose when we bought the car.
As far as the lip, the dealer refused to cover it under warranty, but, they are replacing the roof console to secure it better.
The only thing that secures the lip to the plastic lip bracket is glue.
I am going to try pop rivets.

I swore I would never drive a car again after owning SUV's, but I'm eating crow!
Tired of getting 12 mpg with my 08 Chrysler Aspen and pouring money into fixing it, I traded for my Malibu and glad I did!
32 mpg highway and 28 city...not sure why I didn't do it sooner.
Love the the design inside and out and get all kinds of compliments on its looks.

Personally, this is probably my favorite car in its class....handsomely designed inside and out, a somewhat powerful 4cyl thats excellent on fuel and of course MyLink standard on most models. I've gotten comments from people i didn't even know how much they like the car and what it even is in the first place cause they aren't common around here. Overall its great, i'd highly recommend it to anybody looking for a mid-size sedan. Don't listen to the media on this one..its not a toyota camry so of course they're going to give it a bad review.

We purchased our LTZ last week.
The color and interior we wanted, White Diamond and Brownstone, was not available in the Chicago area.
Our dealer found the car we wanted in Indiana a three hour drive away.
We are very pleased with the car which has the Electronics pkg, LTZ Premium pkg and Advanced Safety Pkg.
It is very quiet and comfortable.
My wife drives the car and has shared that she has received compliments from from people she does not know.
This is a car we may have for a while.
