As others, I compared most of the mid-size vehicles. I wanted to buy American (if that is really possible nowadays). Each car has their own benefits, and despite media comments, none really stand out as a clear leader of the pack. 

Be careful if you select this model. Its still a fine vehicle, though there are some issues. The 13 Eco is one of a kind, as it appears to be discontinued in 14 (the base 2.5L gets the same mpg). 

Many of the features advertised in the normal vehicles are not in the Eco. Mine was advertised to have 10 airbags, though only has 7. Nor does it have the MyLink radio, so forget about Pandora and the other neat features. 

I recommend waiting for a 2014.

Love this Malibu. I traded my 2010 2LT with 59k miles for this ECO 2SA with leather. I travel city/hwy and was getting 24MPG now I am getting 29 MPG City/Hwy. Less engine noise and more power. Shuts engine off at stop lights, restarts when I remove my foot from the brake, seamless.

I can't understand all of the negative reviews about this car that are out there from certain publications. I now have 3000 miles and simply love this car. I just did a 880 mile one way trip on all interstate driving and averaged 34.3 mpg. This is while driving between 70 & 77 mph all of the way. Under regular driving, 55-60, I have attained over 40 mpg while commuting to work (18 miles one way). Some publications say to purchase the Camry, Pris or Sonota hybrids over this car. Go ahead and price them out using 2SA option, add a sunroof and see what price you get. I found that I was able to get exactly what I wanted, without getting other options that I didn't want or need with the Malibu.

The ride of this car is very smooth and very quiet.It's not going to win any contests in the 0-60MPH area, but it will get 30-32 MPG in mixed highway and city driving.Strictly highway driving will yield at least the 37mpg that it's rated for and possibly more depending how heavy your foot gets.Previously had an Acura TL,and I can say that the Malibu outshines the TL in nearly every category.Interior materials including leather are high quality. MyLink system fully integrates with my iPhone including putting album art on the screen. This car is a joy to drive and when I look around at other sedans like the TL or the Lexus IS I feel pretty smart with my decision to buy the Malibu for much less

This is a great car. I have over 2000 miles on the car already and its averaging 33 mpg. Its a smooth car to drive and has more than adequate pick up speed when passing other cars on the road. The interior and exterior of the vehicle are very attractive and its a real pleasure to drive.

I picked this car up to be my wife's everyday driver - love it, the stop/start feature is great going back and forth to work every day in bumper to bumper traffic - she's got a little over 5k miles on it so far and she's be averaging 32 mpg combined, took it on one reasonably long trip and got 39 mpg - the 2.4 ecotec was one of Wards 10 best engines - car is very quiet, zero wind noise, even at highway speeds - however, the low rolling resistance tires pronounce road noise, that being said, it's still more quiet than any other vehicle in the segment

I traded my 2010 Malibu LTZ for the 2013 ECO, and was expecting better fuel economy.
While the upgraded interior and quality of materials are vastly improved, I can't understand why Chevy put in an inferior Pioneer stereo.
I listen to the stereo every time I get in the car, and admittedly pretty loud with the windows down.
The Pioneer has really bad distorcion cranked all the way up and I never had that problem in my 2010 LTZ.

So far, we have owned the car for one week with one extended trip.
 MPG is what we expected, but when driving in the 55 mph zones, the mpg exceeds the EPA mileage.
The quiet ride, smoothness, and overall comfort are quite impressive.
