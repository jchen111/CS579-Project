I can only find a couple things I would do differently with this car which are include a full size spare with the same alloy wheel that's on the car, and include fog lights on all the models.

Now let me start by expressing how much I love this car. I love this car! Chevrolet hit the ball out of the park on the 2013 Malibu.

This car looks really great, I get compliments all the time. The car is so quiet inside when being driven, he handles very well, pretty good acceleration too. 

The fit and finish in this car with the blue accent lighting allows me to really relax at night and enjoy the ride!

Best kept secret out there, a real value for the money. I got a 1LT with the conv package and am impressed with the features for the money.
Great car for little money (low 20's...)

This 2013 Malibu is all the reasons we used to buy import cars. It's quiet inside, good looking on the outside, has amazing tech, plenty of power, gets great gas mileage( 31 MPG rural driving), excellent paint work, all priced lower than most everything else. I don't know why GM couldn't or didn't build cars like this 30 years ago; I am just glad they do now. I was going to lease a Camry SE to replace my aging Tundra which needed several VERY expensive repairs (!!!!) but the Malibu has more equipment and is 30% less in both down money and monthly payment. Best of all the 2013 Malibu is SO much better looking than the "dopey" looking 2013 Camry. Gotta love the cool blue interior illumination.

Have had the Chevy 1LT Malibu for about a month now.
Traded in a 2006 Honda Pilot with almost 100K.
Hard to trade in but it eats gas like nothing.
Really like the better gas mileage.
Not fantastic but a big step up.
We also have a 2012 Honda Accord.
The Accord gets better gas mileage and is zippier and shifts gears smoother.
But, the Malibu feels like a really nice luxury car.
I really like it better.
In fact, my 18 year old likes it much better than the Accord. More bells & whistles.
Will be interesting to see the reliability in the future for both.
But, I have more faith in GM now than in the past.
As far as OnStar navigation which is free for 6 months, not impressed.

This is a nice car, not a great car but a nice car. It does whjat it was made to do, take 4 or 5 people from one place to another in some comfort. It is the first American car I have owned in 20+ years
and yes The American car industry has come a long way but.... why do they scrimp on little things that would make the car a pleasure instgead of
just
O.K.? Windows
that one touch going down but not up? No internal trunk release? Power seats on one side only? and
no going up and down
does NOT make the seat power. No spare tires? Not run flats either..
It
could use a bit more power too. I will say
for the price it is a nice
car.

I have the LT model with the "upgraded interior", bought in mid-Dec 2012.
I find that I am absolutely unable to get the power driver's seat into a comfortable back position, no matter how I adjust the many electric controls.
The lumbar adjustment is completely crazy.
It sticks out WAY too much, even on the most "reduced" setting. 
Otherwise, I have had only 2 issues:
1) Brake lights would not go out after releasing brake pedal because pedal was not coming back up on it's own (needed a new pedal assembly)
2) Steering wheel not centered; wheel was positioned slightly to the right as car was driven straight (needed alignment)

Having my 2013 Malibu for 3 months now, my only problem is that the car comes with NO SPARE / SPACE SAVER TIRE.
No where in the the brochure or window sticker did it say you get an air pump.
Nor did the sales rep say anything.
When I realized there was nothing in the pit I went back to the dealer and was told that I could by a space saver, jack and tools for $500-.
GM Customer Support say sorry: all you get is an air pump and Roadside Assistance.
If you've ever had a blow out or a tire damaged by road debris, a pump is useless; and no, I don't care to wait hours for roadside. GM needs to wise up and and give the customer the option!
