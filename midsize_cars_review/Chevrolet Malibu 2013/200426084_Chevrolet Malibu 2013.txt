I was so excited to purchase my new Malibu. The style is sleek, elegant, and sporty all in one. The MPG is right around 27 for me personally. My biggest problem is the comfort. I didn't notice it until two days later when my back was in so much pain. The head rest forces your head forward and they are not completely removable.
The lumbar section of the seat is not positioned correctly and is rather stiff. I have tried different pillows, reclining the seat completely back and sitting up free style (which is super uncomfortable). I've spoken with 2 customer services reps from GM who passed it back and forth only to pass it on to the dealership which in return said there was nothing they could

I really love this car. I bought the 1LS model and it rides wonderfully, looks sporty. Maybe this vehicle is a little more expensive than competitors, but this is a classic American auto. I bought a 2013 Toyota Corolla and I had serious steering problems so I changed it for this new 2013 Malibu.
The Malibu has a great smooth ride and that the interior is comfortable and excellent design. The car gets mpg just like it says, 37mpg open road and 31mpg in town. Not many cars will get that good right out of the gate. In my experience, I went to Alabama driving around 58 mph average and the car did 52mpg!

13 Malibu has more power, gets better mileage, has more room, and is quieter than my 2000 BMW 323i.

This car has some pretty stiff competition in the Camry, Accord, Altima and Sonata, but I wanted to buy American from a local dealer, if I could.
After comparing, I was impressed enough to buy the Malibu.
It's roomy, quiet, comfortable, powerful, and pretty nice looking.
The electronics features (OnStar, Bluetooth phone integration, XM radio, driver info system) are handy and work great.
Fuel economy was a concern for me, based on ratings, but I've been averaging 31 in my daily commuting (mostly highway) and I've measured tanks of 34 and 36.

I agree that my 2013 is all around much improved on than my traded 2009 LS.
I have to say I am let down since I was anticipating a quiet cabin ride as all the auto site reviewers have endorsed.
Well, I am not experiencing the "quiet" in my new malibu.
I have a annoying vibration/buzz that presents itself when in low gear/ between gears but faithfully dissapears when I accelerate.
Did'nt notice this during test drive otherwise I would of hung on to my 2009 Malibu!

 Ive had my Malibu for a couple of weeks now, It's a beautiful vehicle. I think they made a mistake with the quality and price. I am expecting a call any day now telling me I paid too little and I owe them 5 grand. And do you know, I might just pay it.

This vehicle handles like a dream and is hands down the best mpg car I have ever owned. The stylish interior and the uncanny or almost supernatural exterior designs are amazing!!! It is an incredible work of art. I feel so blessed that I choose to buy one. If the word gets out this vehicle should be the car of the year no doubts about it!!!

The redesigned 2013 Malibu looks and drives nothing like the 2012 model. This car is an extremely comfortable drive and the seats hug you.
It features a quiet interior which you will really notice on those drives on the interstate. In addition to the redesigned interior, Chevy redesigned the gearing to get a car with a total average of about 30mpg city/highway. In short, if you are looking for a reliable car with a sleek look this is the car to have.
