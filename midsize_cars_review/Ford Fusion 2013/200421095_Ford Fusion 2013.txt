After 40K I can say that I generally I like the vehicle. I take issue with the alignment of (or lack of) with the trunk, rear taillights and exterior pillars (all of them). The transmission can be erratic as well. That said, I have not had any major issues, not even with Sync. I travel a lot and rent a variety of cars. The best testament to the Fusion I can give-I fall in love with it every time I get back in it, only to hate it in a few weeks, only to love it again after driving all the other crap. It is the best crap on the road as far as sedans go.

It's beautiful- don't get me wrong. But the amount of times it's been in the shop since its purchase in Nov 2012 has completely negated any value of the vehicle. I've had computer module fails, tire sensor fails, SYNC fails; recall after recall. Now I have pieces falling from the headliner, and clips coming off of the air vents. I have a rip in the carpet under the driver's side mat and a discolored leather driver's seat- neither of which Ford will cover under warranty, and both inexplicable. This is my 2nd Fusion, and I drive this one like I did the 2011- to work and school/sport functions, so there should be no reason for this car to fall apart like it has. Not for a $30,000 price tag.

I own a 2013 red Ford Fusion SE Automatic with the 1.6 Ecoboost engine. The car does a lot well, and drives way better than our 2012 Fusion. The engine averages well over 30 mpg on the highway, yet feels way gutsier than a 1.6 when accelerating, and it also sounds nice. The transmission works well, albeit the sport feature doesn't do much. It's nice that it comes standard with Sync, but the system doesn't always work as expected. So far, our only problem with ownership has been a fuel gauge that depletes way quicker than it should (will say it used 1/4 a tank after 10 miles). It's been to the dealer twice, and they can't figure out why it does this.

I'm really tall and I when I sit in this car I think it was made for me.
It looks great, handles very well and has adequate acceleration.
The most recent update for MyFord Touch fixes the bugs.
Mileage has been good.
I get 34-36 mpg HWY but city mileage can drop below 20mpg in short, stop and go traffic.

I have had my car for just over a year 2013 Ford Fusion SE and it has spent 3 months in total in the shop.
My pre delivery was messed up and no antifreeze was added.
I have since had the heater core replaced and I now have antifreeze in my engine oil.
My main computer control module had to be replaced and this is what took most of the 3 months as Ford had to rewrite the software because there were so many issues initially.
Granted I had a loaner car, I was mortified it took this long!
And the first time my car came out of the shop I had a crack split the whole way across the wind sheild as there was a tool dropped on it.... obviously never to be replaced by the dealership
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have driven my Fusion energi for 3000 miles. I have had one flat and two sidewall tire failures , caused by BRUSHING curbs in parking lots. OF COURSE NO SPARE. Many hours waiting for road service and over $700 spent. This car cannot be driven anywhere safely. Unlike other manufacturers no compact spare is available and a full size spare will not fit in trunk. Obviously Ford has not considered customer convience or safety. Never get vehicle with no spare tire

The redesigned Fusion is a well-executed sedan with a few shortcomings that can't be ignored.
It does the most important things well:
a supremely comfortable ride, an invigorating drivetrain, and looks that strangers still comment on.
The shopping was over when I drove the Fusion.
I still like it after one year of ownership, but it has some annoyances (see below) that buyers should be aware of. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought a new 2013 Fusion SE June 2013.
In Feb 2014, at 7,500 mi. the engine light came on.
First fix was to replace the transmission (??) because Eco-boost engine design caused over-heating.
3 days later engine light came on.
Faulty igniter coil (??) was the cause this time & replaced.
2 days later engine light came on.
Engine needs to be replaced (!!??) due to initial over-heating problem; engine either "warped" or cracked.
It's the Ides of March; I've been waiting for my car for 2 weeks.
I'm supposed to get it back in 2 days; the following day,
I'm driving it from Albuq NM to LA CA.
I will let you know if I make it back w/ no issues.
Wish me luck.

After just over 6 months of ownership and more than 11,500 miles on the ODO, I am still a proud fusion owner. Lifetime MPG average is 28.2 which is over the EPA combined rating of 26 MPG. The exterior is holding up well as far as paint and trim. Although around 6,600 miles the clear coat on my factory black 18in rims began to peal off in chucks. The dealer replaced all four rims and so far so good. Seat comfort lends to hours of HWY driving, while also holding one in place while driving spiritedly. Everything thus far is mechanically sound and brake and tire wear are holding steady. The interior is also holding up well. I highly recommend this car for purchase.

I picked up the Blue fusion with the tech package that included backup sensors and camera and the sync system. I really like the sync system. I am a technical guy so it did not intimidate me. Actually I found it very intuitive once you understand the lay out. The only issue I have is the backup sensors are flaky. They only work around 20% of the time. I will be bringing it back the the dealer to be fixed. Otherwise I really like the car. It handles great. The 2.0L engine was really nice but was out of my price range. The gas mileage is around the same as my little 2004 Pontiac Vibe. The car is very quiet on the highway. So far so good.
