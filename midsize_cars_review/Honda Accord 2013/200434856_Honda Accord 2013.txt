After 9,000 miles and 11 months of ownership, here are my comments. DO NOT get the remote starter. It is a royal PIA on the EX model with push button start. When you remote start the vehicle and get in it, the engine automatically stalls and you have to restart the engine. For every remote start you have to restart the engine. Gee Honda, great for your starter and battery. Real poor design. I would remove the remote start system but it would cost ME money to do it! Also, you cannot exit a running vehicle and try to lock it to run an errand, it won't let you!
The stereo if horrible. The AM is twice as loud as the FM. Very poor quality stereo.

We bought the Honda accord knowing that its reliability and quality build would not let us down. We commute 180 miles daily, to and from, all highway miles. In the first year we put 50K on the vehicle with zero issues.
The vehicle gets great gas mileage as advertised. The down fall....Not only are the seats hard, they have a c type curve design with no lumbar adjustment. For shorter individuals as my wife, the head rest would constantly keep her head leaned forward. She eventually began suffer from back and neck pain. At this point we decided get rid of the vehicle. Other than that, a great vehicle.

Nice car. I did test drive all other cars Camry, altima,passat,fusion but this car stood out number 1 and i bought it. My point of view most valuable car..interms of real value. Perfect balance.I drove to airport with 3 guys(me not included) with 3 big size lugauage bags, as the driver I felt like 2 people going in the car. Unbelivable!

My wife's '04 VW Passat GLS 4Motion came to its deserving end due to an accident and subsequent declaration as a total loss.
We were looking at CUV's, but cost and fuel economy were concerns.
My wife had 3 requests: better MPG, a moonroof, and cloth seats.
In looking at sedans, I just could not see a boring Camry, and the spotty build quality of our Passat soured me on another VW.

I found our 2013 Accord EX, Alabster Silver with black interior as a CPO car with just 12,800 miles on it.
To my amazement, my wife, who has accused me of being a blinded Hondaphile, said, after driving this Accord, that it "spoke" to her.
Four days into ownership, both of us are very pleased.

Prior to purchasing this car(2013 EX sedan) I was driving a inherited 96 Galant that had 145,000+ miles on it. I only had it for about four months when major things started failing one after the other(radiator,a leak in the rack and pinion etc). I made a bad investment fixing some things because the car had sentimental value but you live and you learn. Now I have my new baby.This is my first new car and I'm 31. I paid for it in full so I have that new car syndrome where I don't want anyone to park near me in fear that they'll scratch it(I have it in black crystal). I love the exterior.It looks like it is really packing some muscle under the hood. You feel a little bumpiness but its not bad.

After a couple months, 5,000 miles and a road trip here's my take on the Accord.
Fuel economy is outstanding, equal or better than the EPA estimates.
36+ on the highway typically cruising 5+ over the posted speed limit.
33 mpg combined since purchase but admittedly much of it was hwy miles.
The car is designed around fuel efficiency. The Ambient meter is a brilliant but simple reminder giving instant feedback of your driving habits. The cabin is much quieter and improved over previous models.
The CVT transmission takes a little getting used to but not a big deal.
In fact the more I drive it the more I appreciate it's smoothness. The stereo reads the media quickly and sounds good.

I am disappointed mostly in the transmission. It is unnerving when you stop and the transmission lurches forward. It makes you feel like you,don't have control. My car is 2 months old and twice the check engine light has come on. The first time the dealer replaced the fuel pressure sensor. The very next day another check engine light. Something with too high voltage, so they reset it by switching a part from a car on the lot and then putting my part back in. The latest is the paint. Buy the paint protection, there is no clear coat on the car. I have owned many cars and never has bird poop marred the paint. It took the thin clear coat right off!

we now have approx eight thousand miles and did the first oil change very easy and the care still runs great we get combined around town 23 to 27 mpg and when it includes more freeway we get 28 to 31 and stright freeway going down to magic mountain approx 350 miles driving 75 to 80 we got 30 to 31

Wow. And I was getting ready to give up on Honda. Purchased my first Honda in 1985 and they were awesome cars until about 10 years ago; I noticed reliability and fit and finish deteriorating badly.
I saw the revamped 2013 Accord and read the reviews. I decided to try one more time...MUCH improved but still a ways to go. The interior fit and finish is reminiscent of older days quality-excellent. There is still a bit of cheap hard plastic though. The CVT does not bother me at all and I find the 38mpg I have been getting amazing (ECO on).
Road noise is still evident but not as bad as before. Comfortable ride as I commute 100 miles daily. Stereo so-so. Curious to see if reliability improves.

I'm extremely please with the car. I've got about 22,000 miles on it and it's nicely broken in. On a recent trip to the Outer Banks, NC, I got over 600 miles on a tank of gas, averaging 38.2 mpg! Driving on NC 12 up Hattaras Island at 55-60mph, I averaged 46.3 mpg for the hour drive north to get off the island. Amazing!! I agree that the CVT will not be for everyone, but I like the fact that I get awesome mileage in a very well built, good looking car. Speaker quality is excellent with a digital device, so dont judge sound system until you plug in your own device!
