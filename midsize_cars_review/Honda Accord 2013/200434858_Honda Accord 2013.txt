When I purchased my first Honda, a 2013 Accord, I expected a consistent vehicle that was comfortable to drive and easy to maintain.

While the new features are nice to have, they don't outweigh the incessant rattling noise coming from the dashboard.
The dealerships don't seem to know how to fix it, which makes the situation even worse.

When you purchase a new vehicle like an Accord, you expect the Honda name to hold up.
I have a different opinion of Honda now.

This system does not work 50% of the time. It does not understand voice commands 70% of the time. It does not retain speed dial numbers. It does not accept Gracenote updates for the HDD. It takes 10 minutes after starting to allow you to access controls for
audio using the knobs but prompts use of voice commands which do not WORK!!!

My 2013 Honda Accord took a rock to the condenser within 3 months, it is a common issue for Honda, and they are not willing to correct it. I would not purchase a Honda again.

Overall I'm happy with this car. Looks nice, fun to drive, good gas mileage and comfortable.
My only beef with this car is the poor quality stereo system. During the test drive
my focus was on so many things that I that I really didn't check the sound system out like I should have. I took it for granted that Honda put in a good stereo like on my last Honda. They didn't!
Honda, if you read these reviews, please come up with a fix for this.

Our 5th Honda ('97 Civic EX, '04 Accord EX-L, '08 Odyssey EX-L, '11 CR-V EX-L Navi. Took it out today on first highway outing--about 120 miles round trip. Best Honda we've owned to date. Sufficient power, comfortable ride (though still stiff suspension, excellent handling, smooth CVT (vs. my somewhat choppy CR-V tranny), and quietest cabin of all the Hondas we've owned. Still on first tank of gas, but it appears that mpg will blow away all previous Hondas except our '97 Civic (w/far less comfort/power). Will update this review once we've put more miles on the car.

I fell in love with Honda Accord after I seeing someone driving a Black 2013 EX-L earlier this year. I previously only owned Toyota's (2 Camry's and a RAV 4) but decided to give the Accord. I decided to go for the EX-L w/NAV and it was a great decision. The cloth in the EX looks really cheap, but the leather in the EX-L is luxurious and feels great. This is my first car with a NAV system so the features takes some getting used to.
The gas mileage is much better than any of my Toyota's, but I'm not sure that the ECON button is saving me any money on gas. I love that there is enough space in the back seat for my kids which is a definite plus, and the trunk is huge for groceries and shopping.

Overall this car provides what you might expect. It's a little higher priced for what you get when compared to competitor offerings, but I wanted the reliability of a Honda.

What I did not expect was the horribly designed user interface of the navigation system. Test drives and showroom floor interactions do not allow enough usage to fully grasp the awkward layout and slowness of the system. Not only that, Honda confirmed today that is not and will not be possible to turn off the 'beep' that occurs every time you click. Huh? This is a software change (deficiency). You've got to be kidding me. Using the system is akin to conditioned response from electric shock. You learn to avoid it.

We also own a 2008 Accord EXL navi sedan, and so we can tell how big a jump Honda has made in several areas of this car.

First, the 2013 Accord is *quiet*Âwhich is a first for the Accord.

Second, the new engine is more powerful, faster, and yet gets better mpg. 

Finally, the interior quality is almost Acura-like.

I just picked it up yesterday, so I have to wait to judge the reliability, but I love what I've seen so far.
Drove Acura TSX, 2013 Altima, Rogue and CRV..this beats them all for features and value hands down. Very smooth ride..voice response system easy to learn...while interior not as luxurious as the Acura, the standard features are more numerous in the Accord. I will update this with actual MPG after a few tankfuls.

My lease was up on my 2010 BMW 328i x-drive (AWD) and I decided to get off the lease treadmill and buy...in this case a 2013 Accord EX-L with navigation.


Overall, I am very happy with the switch.
This is the first Honda I've owned.


Build quality is excellent, road noise is probably less than my BMW.
