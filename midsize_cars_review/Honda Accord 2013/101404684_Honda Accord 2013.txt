My 2013 Honda Accord w/CVT has serious issues.
Over the last three months I started experiencing abnormal hesitation while trying to accelerate from a standstill position. I have had to depress the accelerator all the way down to board for several seconds (5 - 8 seconds) before the car would jerkingly jump into proper gear to move forward.
The dealership changed a kit on it at least twice which initially seemed to have corrected the problem but after about a week or two the problem is recurring.
Then on June 14 an addt'l problem occurred where the car started a quick forward jerking motion at 40mph. Honda knows the issue but keeps denying the problem exists as they cannot replicate.

I love my 2013 Accord LX CVT. Probably the best looking Accord to date. Plenty of power for city driving or the freeway. CVT is a first for me but anytime you can cruise 70 mph @ 19-2000 rpm in a 3200 lb car is a win. Great interior, comfortable seats, great stereo. I managed 38 mpg on the highway today and the car has only 5k so I'm sure it will loosen up a bit once its broken in and gets synthetic oil inside

My girlfriend lives in Upstate NY,
hadn't driven her car for three days, and decided to go shopping.
Returning home after a roundtrip of about five miles, she turned off the vehicle for about five minutes and it would not restart. AAA was called and provided a jumpstart, but said their tester indicated the battery would not hold the charge. She them drove the car to the dealer for their assessment. Their answer was that these Accords need to be driven every couple days at least and if not, the owner should buy a trickle charger. A trickle charger? If the car is not driven every couple days? It's a 2013 car, not a 1913.
Honda needs to address this issue.

2013 Accord LX, CVT Auto, 15,200 miles (bought new).
A few seconds after starting the car, it made a horrendous grinding, screeching sound, with every indicator light on.
I did not drive it, and it was towed to a dealer.
It needed a new oil pump, timing chain, sprocket, etc - all covered under warranty.
The dealer had no idea why the failure occured, and had never seen this on a Honda with so few miles.
It took a week to repair, which was a major inconvenience.
The car ran fine with no problems at all prior to this incident.
I am sorry I purchased a Honda with so many other choices out there.
I was sold on their legandary reliability.

For all the good Honda has had over the years, they really messed up with this car. And I am a 2nd time Honda owner. The 2003 Accord I had was the best car I ever had and that is why I decided to go with another one.

The CVT transmission is lousy. The car buckles and stutters, especially on acceleration. Have had it back to the dealer and even had Honda look at it but they insist nothing is wrong. They even said that the stutter is part of the CVT technology. These transmissions are put in for fuel economy. But at the expense of this kind of performance is un acceptable.

All I can say is Honda will have a very difficult time selling these vehicles if this continues.

Yes, my 1st Honda so expectation was high.
I have gotten a Nissan Frontier & Sentra before and had owned and driven countless other.
Before getting this I was debating between Toyota Camry & Hyundai Sonata; didn't test drive and went straight to Honda instead.

Good = Roomy & comfy w/ nice design. ect..
Bad = Wind noise! Cold reverse doesn't catch so fast. Black fabric is a lint magnet. Done.

I have owned my 2013 Accord Sedan for 8 months now, and overall, I am very satisfied.
The car handles very nicely, is very comfortable (I am 6'2"), looks great, accelerates nicely, is quiet, and came with lots of great standard features, like the bluetooth and backup camera.

I have drive mostly in the city, and mileage is okay - around 24 mpg. However, highway mileage is great - around 38 mpg.

I have experience the CVT stuttering mentioned by other reviewers on occasion. It is not that bad so, at least in my car. However, Honda really should address this issue if lots of buyers are having a major problem with it.

The 2013 Accord has a transmission shudder or judder in it when cold and in stop and go traffic.
I have called the dealer and called Honda, Honda agrees there is a problem but there is no fix yet.
I tried to get them to buy the car back, only have 1000miles on it.
They won't.


So I DONT recommend you buy the CVT version of the 2013 Accord.. You have been warned.

I am stuck with the car, but I have contacted Consumer Affairs, BBB, and WAVY TV 10.


I hope Andy Fox will call me and go for a ride in this car.

The test drive was after the car was warmed up and on the highway. No stop and go traffic.Figures.
Honda if you take care of me , I will stop this bad publicity of your 2013 Accord.

I have to say that my first time dealing with Honda was a real pleasant surprise. 

I purchased the Honda Accord because I needed a
nice sedan after having a great Hyundai SUV that I worked to death. The quality and nice amenities that came with this basic model is amazing. No one else could give me the same bennies
Honda could or the same quality after checking out the competition. I also wanted something that depreciated less than the other brands. Only Toyota Camry was equal in the respect and after being in the Camry, I saw that the interior was inferior and the design a bit dated.

The 2013 Honda is fantastic and turns heads everywhere I go. As pretty as a BMW

We bought a 2013 Accord about a month ago. After 1600 miles I have found that the gas mileage is phenomenal. I have averaged a high of
41 on the highway. In mixed driving I average 33. The power is as good as you would want. Who needs a 6 cylinder. The car rides firm but is very comfortable. It handles right sporty. I have owned many Honda's and this one is a great car.
