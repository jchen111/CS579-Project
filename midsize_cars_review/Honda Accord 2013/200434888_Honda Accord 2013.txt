When you use Apple gear, it is a joy because everything "just works".
I find it the same way with Hondas.
I now have a few hundred miles on my 2014 EX Coupe and I still smile every time I get in.
It has sporty performance, very comfortable, and just enough tech to be helpful, but not get in the way.

I bought this 2013 Accord to replace my 2012 Civic that was destroyed in Hurricaine Sandy. The salesman steared me into this car and now I have Buyer's Remorse. I have owned many Honda's in my day, Prelude's and Accord's but this model is a looser. 3 weeks in I called to ask the dealer if I could exchange for a Civic and he said "Not without big fees" 
The problem is they have tried to make everything microprocessor based. You can't just spin a dial and tune the rabio anymore. I gone off the road, twice already just trying to search for a new station. 
This car is an overdesigned dog! Take it from a longtime Honda owner. Consider the features offered and if you really need them.
