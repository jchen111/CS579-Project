I have driven this 2014 Legacy Sport for three months.
The reliability of Subaru, all wheel drive and heated seats are all positives that are negated by the poor ride quality.
I feel every dip, bump and tar strip in the road and will be trading this after a year.
A younger driver might not care about the ride because the car looks sharp and handles well.

I owned a 2001 Subaru Outback station wagon for 6 years and it was reliable and a comfortable ride with reasonable handling in not too large of a vehicle.
If they built that vehicle today with an improved transmission I think they wood sell a lot of them.

I appreciate any comments and criticism.
