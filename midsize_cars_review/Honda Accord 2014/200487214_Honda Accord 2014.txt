For $19.3k I think I got a terrific manual Accord.  But only 600 miles so far, can't speak to reliability.  I preferred the Accord's manual stick to the Mazda 6 manual stick.  I swapped OEM tires out for Continental PureContact Eco Plus and was surprised at improved handling and even quieter ride.  Much quieter ride than the Mazda 6.  This is important to me, I like handling but low profile tires are a liability in the NE with its potholes. And the handling is plenty great with 16" rims.

I just purchased my first vehicle which is a 2014 Honda Accord LX from AutoNation Honda in Sanford, FL.
I love the new body style of the Accord and I knew that was the car of my choice.
I wanted leather seats and sun roof but the EXL was a bit too much, so I started looking at the LX.
Originally, the LX doesn't come with leather interior or sunroof but Skip helped me get the car of my choice and it was all in my price range.
