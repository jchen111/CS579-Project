Coming from a Nissan Xterra to an Accord coupe took some getting used to but I'm glad I went with my decision.  I was looking for something that would save gas, be reliable and have some pep out the gate.  By no means is it a real sports car, but it has enough in there to get around traffic.  As far as reliability, I only have 6 thousand + miles on it, so far so good.  Only time will tell how reliable it will be.  Gas savings is as advertised.  I'm averaging 24mpg combined.  No ECON button on and doing 80% city with 20% hwy.  I do love the road trips though, I get around 36mpg.  Overall,  I'm satisfied except for the radio.  That needs some improvement.
