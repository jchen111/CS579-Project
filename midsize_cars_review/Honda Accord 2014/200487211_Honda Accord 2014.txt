Hit 11K today after a 620 mile round trip.  MPG is well better than stated, I get 34 highway driving it like I stole it.  I'm just SO happy with this car. It's smooth, fast, comfortable, full of the latest tech, reliable and affordable. All I've done is put gas in it and change the oil around 8K (there's an oil life guage that tells you when to change it, I change early. Amazing. It took 10 years to learn the lesson to stick w/Honda after my 2004 that was bullet proof.  I replaced a 13 Altima, bought back under lemon law due to numerous problems, largest being dropped the transmission twice within 7k miles.  The Lord works in mysterious ways, got enough $ to upgrade to the V6. Love my Honda!

I admit, I was a little bit reluctant to buy the V6 model Accord due to the negative press and some negative remarks on some chat boards.

I really hope that Honda has really fixed the issues with VCM technology because it is quite amazing to get nearly the same gas mileage of the 4 Cylinder with the performance of the 6.
I can tell you right now that my gas mileage is better than advertised.
The car is packed with useful technology such as the side view camera and Collision avoidance and Lane Watch.
The car is smooth and powerful. On balance, I am very happy with my choice.
VCM is not perfect I notice the switch from 3 Cylinder mode to 6 more so then the reverse.

Was very reluctant to purchase another Honda Accord after having engine oil consumption issues with '09 EXL v6.
Test drove 2013 Toyota Avalon and was not impressed.
Wife loved the ride of the '14 Accord EXL-V6 so we decided to give Honda a second chance.
So far, 10K miles, we love the ride and get average 32-34 mpg at 70-75 mph hwy.
Just got 38 mpg in 200 mile stretch of North Carolina. Typically get 27-29 mpg combined.
Ride is smooth and comfortable.

Now the negative. At 7K miles, 1 qt oil low so I added 1 qt 0W20 synthetic.
At 9K miles added another 1/2 qt.
Maybe this will never pose a serious problem, but I am extremely irritated that we have to keep checking oil periodically!

Just purchased new last week. Was able to get $ 5500 off of sticker price, due to negative comments by Consumer Reports regarding the V6 models reliability. Yes, the car doesn't ride as smooth as a luxury vehicle. I am fine with the ride, feels sporty. Lots of complaints about the ride quality, don't buy it if you don't like it...No, I cannot feel any vibrations from the 6 when 3 cyl are deactivated (Fixed for 2014??) Yes, the car is a bit noisy at HWY speeds but quieter than my 2011 EX. Seems quiet around 40 but wind and road noise present at 65 +. Yes, HandsFreeLink needs work! Not intuitive and functionality limited. Difficult to set up speed dial, etc.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the market for a new car and a previous Accord owner I jumped ship to a 5th Gen Nissan Altima. On paper it made sense, it offered features the Accord didn't at thousands less.
2 transmissions, a new radio and the dash, moonroof and rear deck rattling like a tin can later Nissan was finally forced to buy it back under lemon law.
Back to the Honda lot I went and bought a 2014 EX-L V6.
I'll say the car delivers.
It's solid, quiet, fuel efficient and styled as aggressively as I'd like.
The ground doesn't light up when I open the door and the seat doesn't 60/40 split (cmon Honda?), but I'm in love with the ride and comfort.
Don't agree w/the seat complaints, 10 way pwr suits my bad back!
