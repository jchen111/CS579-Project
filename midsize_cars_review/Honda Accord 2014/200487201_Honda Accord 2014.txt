Turned in 2011 leased Honda Accord V6 and picked up the 2014.
Everything is really outstanding except for the navigation system.
We were not aware or advised that it cannot be fully accessed while the car is in motion.
This is really bad, since the passenger is disallowed as well.
The voice commands don't work well for us, and it's a lot more distracting.
This is a real deal breaker for us, and I won't be getting any more Honda's, unless this changes.
The menu system is a lot worse than the 2011 model and a lot more difficult to navigate through the commands with a lot more extra steps.
Also the center console has less storage space and is less convenient.

My wife and I just put 600 miles on our new Accord Touring on a road trip through the mountains. We drove up to an altitude of 12,000 ft. The roads were full of hills and curves that would have been perfect for a driving a Porsche or BMW, but we found ourselves more and more impressed with how solid the Accord handled and felt. It had tons of passing power, yet still averaged 35 MPG overall. Consider us impressed. I have had nearly a dozen high-end European cars over the past 25 years and the Accord comes surprisingly close to their level of build quality and features. I'm not sure it's worth spending the extra 20 grand to get the satisfaction of knowing other people envy what you drive.

I bought an Alabaster Silver with Black Interior Leather 2014 Honda Accord Touring and added these features: remote starter,
sports grille, wing spoiler,
moonroof visor, door visor, splash guard, body side molding, interior illumination,
trunk trays, mats, cargo hook, and door guards. I paid $3500 less than MSRP. 

Friendly Honda of Poughkeepsie, NY told me that this is the best car they delivered to a customer with all the added accessories.

This is my 3rd Honda Accord and this my favorite and most equipped;
