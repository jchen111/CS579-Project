This is the 4th new accord I have purchased.  My first one faithfully served for 18 years and I am finishing my 7th year with my third.  #2 got totaled at 12 years of age.  The improvements in noise and fuel economy compared to the 8th generation is nothing short of astounding.  Computer regularly shows 36 on the highway and averages overall about 29.

The CVT with paddle shifters is really smooth in operation always having the correct ratio.  I love clicking the negative paddle to increase the engine braking when going down hills and off ramps.  Sport mode brings the engine to life for twisties.  A manual will always be more fun but living in PDX metro area traffic is too frequent for it.

Best car I have ever owned. Definitely worth the value.

My 4th Accord LX ('89, '96,'01; my fiancÃ©e had the 11 EX-L; my mom had a CR-V and now owns the '13 Odyssey)! Without trying to sound too unforgiving, Honda has finally lost my complete attention. This harsh review stems from two issues. Interiors cheaply built in general, need far better craftsmanship, durability & quality. Competitors, like VW offer way better feel, textures, and look (my 135 lb fiancee's '11 leather armrest & seat wore out torn by 40k; my '14 has a hole in driver floor mat from only 2500 miles, now big enough to fit an apple to a hole in the interior floor carpeting. Thankful, owning more than 30+ cars on none had this ever happened. Highly regret not getting a Passat :(
