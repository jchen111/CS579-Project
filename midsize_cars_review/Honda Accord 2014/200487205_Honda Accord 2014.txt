This Honda Accord has a terrible audio system.
It is junk.
I did not realize how bad it was or else I would not have purchased the vehicle.
I commute 90 minutes each day and the audio is important. The radio had excess static .
There is no subwoofer. The speakers are tinny, muffled.
When the sunroof is open and driving on the highway, I can't hear the sound! I don't understand why Honda would not
offer a better system in such an expensive car without having to buy leather options. I would like Honda to offer a remedy to this problem in my current vehicle. If not, I will not buy another Honda again. (I had been a Toyota owner for 20 YEARS!
Unfortunately, it may be my last.

The vehicle is about 5 months old with a little over 4000 miles. About to take it back for the 4th time for rattling/ticking noises in the cabin. Dealer has looked at the dashboard, passenger door, center console. Now the glove box door is making a ticking noise. The night shift must've assembled this vehicle. Drivetrain works well, and love the passenger side camera. About what I'd expect from a $24,000 car....except for the ticking noise. Went from a 2000 Toyota Avalon to the 2014 Accord. The Avalon, with 232,000 miles, was quieter than this vehicle. Prefer driving my daughter's 2006 Mazda so that I can avoid the ticking noise in the Accord.

I test drove an EX CVT and a EXL V6 back to back before purchasing the EXL V6. The EX interior was not near as nice as my 2011 EX interior, very plain, no wood trim, etc. Also, the CVT does a great job and isn't noticeable, until you need power. Then it revs up and hangs there at high rpm until you let off. These were issues for me so I went with the EX-L V6 (which is a totally different driving experience)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Background:
I took more than one year to buy new car and in between I was going through numerous reviews, Test Rides and friends experiences (Whoever bought any car brand in 1st week they were blown away but after some time you can see them back to reality).

SUV or Car: In my purchase process I was first confused to go with Sedan or SUV. My daily Driving is 70 miles RT and compact crossover SUV failed to impress me in front of Midsize sedans so finally decided to go with Car.


I have 2002 Camry. In 2012 I was almost sure to buy Camry but as time goes I took test ride of Nissan Altima 2013, Kia Optima 13, Sonata 13, Toyota Camry 13 and Accord 13.
After major changes in accord
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my 2nd Honda Accord and 4th Honda overall since 1990 and this is surely the best one yet. I started looking around a year ago to replace my 02 Accord and really wanted something different. I took a hard look at the Nissan Altima but there were numerous consumer reviews complaining about transmission issues and overall workmanship.
At the end of my research I decided I would buy another Accord and I am very happy I did. The included features, design, MPG, quality, performance, and consumer and professional reviews made it a no brainer that the Accord was a class leader. 

The car handles very well on the road, the CVT is silky smooth, and the interior is very comfortable.
