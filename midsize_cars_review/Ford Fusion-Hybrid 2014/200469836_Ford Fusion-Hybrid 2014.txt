I bought this car 6 weeks ago for an around the country trip.
So far I've put 9000 miles on the car and traveled from Atlanta through the north to Oregon, to South California, and back through the south.
2 weeks after I bought the car, Ford came out with their announcement....sorry...we meant 40 MPG on the road, not 47.
That was one of the reasons I had purchased this car.
But hey, going to get some money back in September, right?
Fuel milage has only once came near the 40 (new number) for the highway.
So far, I'm averaging around 36 mpg.
That has been disappointing.
But the other reasons I bought the car was for the comfort and quiet on on that it delivers!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an update from my initial review, which I placed at about 12K miles.
My usage has been consistent, with a mix of congested city, rural two-lane, and high speed interstate driving, in temperature ranging from 20 F to 118 F.
Absolutely nothing has gone wrong with the car.
I have had the oil changed twice, and the tires rotated once via Ford dealer.
No squeaks, rattles or other maladies have appeared.
No fluid additions required.
My other observations at 12K still apply, so this update may be helpful to potential purchasers because my experience is now based on 22K of driving in all conditions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my "work" car, purchased for that purpose.
Although I have driven a series of employer-provided vehicles over the years, (Ford and GM sedans), this is the first purchase for my own use.
The Fusion is, (I am embarrassed to say), the first American-branded vehicle I have ever owned, and I am 50 years old.
I drive a mix of 70-75 mph highway, congested city and rural two lane.

By way of background, I am fussy and a bit of a "car guy."
(Other vehicles:
Miata 6M and Acura TSX 5A.)
Also, I have prior experience with Toyota hybrids.
I like them, and have driven approximately 10K miles in a Gen 3 Prius and a 2009 Camry hybrid

That said, here are my observations at the 12K mark:
