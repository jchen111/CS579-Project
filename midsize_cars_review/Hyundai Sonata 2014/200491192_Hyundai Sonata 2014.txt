I purchased a 2014 turbo SE. I wanted a v6 but did not want to spend the gas for the power, so the turbo fits the bill. With 274 horsepower it has plenty of power for merging onto the freeway, passing, and gets a respectable 0-60 time. I am averaging 23 mpg city, and 33 hwy. The car is smoother and quieter than the 2013 gls we have. The backup camera is nice, it take some getting used to if you never had one. I have already used it to help in parallel parking. I like the handling, steering, power, comfort, and style that the Sonata turbo SE has. I highly recommend the Sonata turbo to anyone wanting the power of a v6 but the gas mileage of a 4 banger.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have had the car now for just under 1k miles.
I do not see much difference with the steering wheel comfort/sport settings.
At 6'2" it has plenty of room for me even with the sunroof.
Back up camera is good, power is nice, averaging 26 MPG total.
Was able to use Boostup website to get additional $500 off for a total cost for the 2014 Premium package SE 2.0T at $26885 before tax, fees, etc.
Felt like amazing deal to me.
