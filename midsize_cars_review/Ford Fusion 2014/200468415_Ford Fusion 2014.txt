Looking for a mid-size AWD sedan and my wants included AWD, styling, quiet, state of the art electronics, Adaptive Cruise Control/Collision Avoidance, trunk that can fit multiple sets of golf clubs, and fun to drive. I value everyday drivability on the roads I actually drive on over track performance. I drove the BMW 3, Audi A4, Cadillac ATS, Volvo S60, Infiniti Q50.
Almost giving up, tried the Fusion. Man, was I ever surprised and impressed. This car is fantastic in every aspect I care about. I was prepared to buy a much more expensive car. This car is SO smooth, so quiet, so comfortable, sporty enough, a joy to drive. I really like SYNC, too. Well done, Ford, you won me over, easily.
