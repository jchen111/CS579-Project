Third Altima after 4 Infinitis and this is as good, or better, than any of the previous.
One year old with only 7000 miles and not one problem! The previous 6 were all V6 and this is my first 4 cylinder and I have no problem with less horsepower.
Actually got 41 MPH on a recent trip to Phoenix.
Quality of build is excellent, ride and handling are super and my dealer is superb.
I see no reason for me to ever consider another brand. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I couldn't say enough bad things about this car.
Bought it brand new.
Notice you can select the production date for the reviews...horrible quality before November 2012.
After November, I don't think they've fixed anything either, but addressed the crash tests.
CVT problems, radio replaced, heated seats didn't work, moonroof rattles (numerous repair/replacement attempts), rear deck and dash rattle, alternator replaced.
If it can go wrong, it did.
Took about 2K miles to start falling apart on me.
Worse than the car was dealing w/nissan consumer affairs.
Left me no choice but to contact an attorney who got my $ back in 2 weeks.
STAY AWAY from Nissan.

I have a 2013 altima SL and it has the vibration/noise at 1200-1500 RPM.
Was anyone successful in getting it fixed and it stays fixed?????
 Does anyone know what the production change was in dec 2012

Looking for a vehicle to replace my 2008 Explorer, I wanted room for 3 car seats in the rear while still getting 30+mpg. I came across the Altima after thinking how great my 2005 Altima was, and after looking at it in person, i was not disappointed. The front seats are extremely comfortable, took a 14 hour road trip one week after purchase and no complaints with comfort. Rear seat holds 3 carseats snuggly (its not an SUV), headroom not an issue for my kids. Trunk is massive. Leater is soft and comfortable. Heated seats get very warm on hi and heated steering wheel is a nice plus. No issues with bluetooth with iphone 5. Averaged 34mpg on hwy driving 80-85mph. Average 32 in city.

I bought this car based on its high marks for overall quality of past Altima's. the new design is what sold me.

I bought the 4 cylinder SL with all the bells and whistles. This car is right on the door step of going back to nissan.
It has already had 2 recalls. The next recall will be related to a belt that was put on the first group of Altimas that did not fit which is causing extra noise on acceleration.
There is now a high pitch squeal that Nissan knows about coming from the power steering motor that Nissan is calling
normal.
For $30,000, it is not normal. Anyone that has one of the first 2013's
have them check that belt because mine needed to be replaced.

Bought the car, drove off from the dealership in Toronto and hear the rattling sound from the rear section behind the drivers seat. Took out everything from the car, drove again for about 100 kms & the rattling is there, took it to the dealership, they said its the headliner, tried to fix it broke the headliner, then they order a new headliner & replaced it, called me to pick it up after 3 weeks, I went to pick it up, inspect the car & there are big wet stains inside the sunroof shade, showed it to them left it for one more day, now its been a week they were unable to clean the stains and are replacing the sunshade.

I've been without my car for 4 weeks now. Extremely disappointed I am

I just bought an SL model and am very pleased so far.
I rented one (S model) from Hertz before I bought one, and. got 40.8 MPG on a 90 mile highway trip with the cruise set at 69.
That sold me.

A couple of thinfgs of note:
The car is very comfortable, but the S model lacks lumbar support - you notice after a while.
The oil change interval is 3,700 miles -expensive over the life of the car.
There is a 500 rebate on the car that I didn't know about until after I made my deal.
I paid 26,300 after the rebate.

I also rented a new style Malibu as well.
It also drives great, has a nice interior and got 37 mph on the same trip. I found the cars drove similarly, but preferred the altima styling

I purchased an Altima 2.5 SL
in the begining of August mainly based on its 27/38 mpg adertisement. The car has very comfortable interior, love the seats and overall interior feel. After driving his car for two weeks, I was getting approx. 15-17 MPG. Took it to the dealer who suggested that I drive this car atleast 1000 miles and then car will deliver better mpg. After driving 1,600 miles (70% highway, 30% city) the most I got is 18. I went back to the dealer who told me to contact Nissan North America. I called them a month ago and registered my complaint. They have assigned my case to a regional specialist and
I am still waiting to speak to this person.They have the worst customer service

Bought the 2013 Altima 2.5 SL 4cy CVT automatic middle Sept 2012.
 I love the car.
The finishes in
the interior are top notch.
The controls for radio, heat/AC, cruise, and such are easy to use and figure out.
 I activated the blue tooth for my smart phone in seconds.
 The mileage has been spot on.
I drive a mixture of city and highway and average 33.5 MPH.
The readout on the car shows 33.2mph.
 I am very happy with my purchase.
 The reviews I read mention the noise from the CVT.
While I have heard this, I don't consider the noise intrusive.
 I like hearing the low growl when accerlerating on the interstate.
Bose sound system is awesome.
The seats are so comfortable.

I own 2013 Altima SL model. I purchased it a month ago, and I have 1200 miles in it. Loved every mile driven on it.
Ride is so comfortable and handling is very easy. I feel steering wheel steady even at freeway speeds.
I never had Altima in my mind when I was looking to purchase a car. I was going back and forth between Camry for roominess and Civic for gas mileage. 
I happen to notice Altima since the Nissan dealer was right next door to Toyota.
I noticed the rich exterior/interior look that was lacking in Camry. 
I also noticed that Altima had a nice MPG ratings and is comparable to Civic on this. These factors tipped me in favor of Altima.
I average around 32.5 MPG so far.
