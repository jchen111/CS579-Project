I bought this car based on Features it has to offer. After driving 5000 miles problem started. The break lights comes on randomly while driving. took it to dealership 3 time and they said nothing wrong. Car stopped on road with engine sign. They replaced part and after driving another 100 miles it stopped again. Dealer replace another part. Air conditioning stop working. they have to replace compressor. Side mirror came loose and was making rattling sound. They fixed that and after a month side mirror switch stop working. Navigation is also not refreshing while driving so they said they have to replace SD card. Complain to North America Nissan but they are not doing anything to replace this

Problems seems to be popping up.
First time I had a car stop behind me when backing up...accident since no warning.
Next, back up screen showed electrical waverings and passenger air bag lit up.
Passenger door whistles and sounds as though something is open when not.
CD player only holds ONE disc at a time (bad, bad) and recently when I did a phone call while CD was playing and ended it, a message saying No USB connection)
Lastly (for now) the car slips into neutral at 35 mph and has to be shifted from drive to neutral and back to drive.

Probably should have bought another Honda Accord since it seems Nissan, though has great styling, conveniences and good gas mileage, has many "bugs"

I have tried my best to try to get Nissan to help me with a vibration problem that is occuring in my so called new car.
I purchased this car June 1, 2013 and it was brand new.
6 Months later I am having issues.
The had to change the left front strut which was causing my car to make a thumbing noise when I was driving slow.


My car was perfectly fine till I got it back and then I noticed the vibration in my car that you can feel through the steering wheel.
Nissan dealership in Lewisville Texas made me seem as if I was crazy.
I strongly advice you to stay away from Nissan Altima until they figure out what is causing their vehicles to vibrate making the ride very uncomfortable.

When I purchased my 2013 Altima in October 2013 it had 149 miles. During my short test drive I did not notice any engine noise. However, as I continued to drive the vehicle I noticed a high pitched whine coming from the engine. This noise is continuing to increase in volume. I rented a 2013 Altima 2.5 in November from Alamo that had 20000 miles and this same noise problem with a much higher volume. I took my car back to the dealer and they wrote on the service request that they could not duplicate the noise. I am going to take it back again and see what their response is.

 The nissan altima is a great car for it's class. It gets
 great fuel economey, yet gets decent performance. My car has the tech package. It has Blind spot warning, lane departure warning, and moving object detection.The intierier fit and finish is impressive. The navigation system works well. The optional Bose sound system sounds fine, but not exeptional. It is however better then the standard speakers. The zero gravity seats are quite comfortable. Overall the Altima is a good choice for it's segment. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The major issue is that we are getting 23 to 25 MPG in the City and no better than 30 to 32 on the Highway.
This falls far short of the rated 27/38 that is heavily promoted by Nissan.
I did a lot of research on this before buying to make sure there werenÂt any issues with stated MPG.

I donÂt believe anyone is getting over 27 in the city unless they are doing a lot of coasting.

Nissan has looked at the vehicle 3 times and as of the last visit said they also got 23 MPG but found no mechanical issues with the vehicle.
The dealer recommended that I contact Nissan Consumer Affairs.
They said that temperature and using the A/C will reduce MPG.
Car should be rated for 25/30 at best.

I have been driving my 2013 2.5 SL Altima for a couple of months now.
I have absolutely no regrets.
The car is flawless in both build and performance.
Don't believe any bad hype about the CVT you may read on the Internet.
It's smooth and responsive.
I actually prefer it now to a traditional automatic.
The 2.5L in-line 4 cyl engine is powerful enough for 90% of drivers including me.
On a recent trip I got 40.9 mpg which is more than Nissan claims!
Around town I get the advertised 28 mpg.
I love the blind spot warning system, too.
It's so good I think ALL cars should have it!
Why can't GM build a car like this????????
(The Altima is built in Tennessee.)

We purchased a 2013 Altima the month they were released.
The good:
Great ride, great seats, excellent climate control, fuel economy, generally good controls.
The bad:
Transmission failed at 13k. For months we were told the jerking and shuddering was normal, then the trans failed completely.
Wind noise.
Paint easily scratched/marked.
Engine is noisy esp under light acceleration.
CVT transmission is annoying, acts like the old 2-speed "Powerglide" in Grandma's Impala.
It's either revving like crazy or so low the engine lugs.
Nissan was good about replacing the transmission (this time), next time who knows?
Accord, Impala, Fusion, Camry are all better options.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I withheld judgment even after the numerous issues I've had but now it needs a new transmission at 12,000 mi.
I've owned a '04 Altima and a
'11 Murano.
In a word, this '13 Altima is junk.
Within the 1st mo of ownership I had a blinking navigation screen (replaced), leather trim on the center console backseat unfinished (replaced), heated seats wired wrong (new wiring harnesses both sides). Within 2 mos I developed the infamous "lugging" transmission (new torque converter and belts= no difference)
Within 5 mos the driver/passenger windows = excessive wind noise (both outside mirrors replaced).
Now clicking noise in transmission requiring new transmission.
I'm just a my 1 yr ownership.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nissan pushed this car out too quick IMO.
Replaced my totaled 2012 without hesitation as it was perfect (final year before the 13 redesign).
Less than a year old and 15 different warranty repairs, 30+ visits to the stealership.
Moonroof rattles constantly, removed and reassembled, then completely replaced along with windshield and headliner.
Still rattles, filed lemon law, pending buy back.
Beware, wait for 2014 and still wait for reviews on that model to come out.
