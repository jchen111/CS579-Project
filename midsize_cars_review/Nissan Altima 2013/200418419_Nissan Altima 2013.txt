We purchased the last 2013 on the lot and got a great deal.
The ride is very comfortable I took it on a 250 mile road trip and wasn't sore at all. The fuel economy was fantastic especially for a V6 I got 35 mpg for the trip.
The only issues is the fabric that the seats are made of are nice and plush with a white dog who sheds we have to vacuum it out at least once a week to keep it looking good inside.
The voice commands are awful.
In my 2013 Hyundai the voice commands are better and work.
However the interface on the Nav works great so I don't feel the need to tell the car to do things.
for the bulk of what I do the buttons on the console and on the steering wheel are great

I expect Fuel to stay around the 3 to 3.25 range so I bought the 3.5 SV , i prefer cloth interior .
I have about 10,000 miles .
I converted to 0-20 viscosity Mobile one oil .
I get about 34.5 average highway , the computer stays about 27.7 average around Houston . I love the acceleration and quietness of the CVT .
The 3.5 has no noise when gunning the engine .
Materials are excellent , love the engine and power . Best car I ever owned , got it on sale for about 25,000, beats everything in its class . Low interest rate

I cannot understand all the criticism of the CVT tranny. I just purchased it on Jan 1, 2014 & it is as near perfect as you can get. I have driven it in a hard acceleration mode as well as normal driving & I cannot even tell when it shifts, & boy when I get on it, it really goes. No hesitations or quirky little hiccups. The paddle shift is neat, but I don't use it. We live in the mountains & the driving is up, down & all around & we are already getting 27 MPG on it. For a large V6, this is excellent mileage. I fully expect to get over 30 mpg on a trip. I do not know anything about the 2.5, but if you purchase this vehicle, I highly recommend the 3.5. This is a great car.

I test drove a 3 series BMW, 4 series Audi, and the Sonata. Decided on the Altima 3.5SV. Came with all the bells and whistles, but at reasonable price when compared with BMW and Audi. The fit and trim is excellent. The car feels more expensive than it costs. The Sonata, although also very nice looking did not handle as well as the Altima 3.5 SV. Chose cloth over leather for comfort. Gets hot where I live. Test drove the 2.5 Altima. No comparison to the 3.5 for pep and go. The Altima 3.5 is very compariable to the pep of BMW and Audi. Highly recommend the Altima 3.5.

If you're prone to carpel tunnel or if you have any arthritis in your hands, you'll probably want to find a different car. I didn't know I was in either of these categories, but I'm finding that driving this car can be real work.

I bought my new 2013 Altima about 3 months ago and it's been in the service dept 3 times. My car vibrates terribly. They first said it just needed a computer upgrade or something and that should fix it. It didnt. I took it back and they determined it needed a new Torque Converter and that would stop the vibration. It didnt. I took it back a 3rd time and they said my back right rim was oval and replaced it with a round one and that wouldfix it. It didnt. Each time they hooked it up to their computer, contacted "Tech line" and stayed in touch with Nissans regional office for further instructions. It's still not fixed. Now nissan is telling me it's normal and that's it!? I'm not sure what to do
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the past I heard nothing but good things about Nissan, so with the new Altima body style and the available 3.5 liter option I decided to give it a try. This car was junk since the day I drove it off the lot. There was an issue with bolts in the front wheel area being installed backwards.
The brakes always had problems where they would stick. A really loud rattle in the roof near the sunroof which Nissan claimed they never heard. A broken air vent.
The blinker would stick.
The passenger airbag would deactivate while driving with a 160 pound passenger in the seat. The manufacturer would do nothing about any of it. Go buy a Lexus or Toyota they are more reliable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come on Nissan- whatcha gonna do for all of us? This cars SUCKS! And with so many of us having the same problems you'd think they do something fast. How many does it take for a class action suit? I have brought the car back 5 times already. So far they've supposedly replaced the entire transmission, replaced the torque converter, reset the computer and car still bucks, chugs, surges forward at exactly 25 mph. and vibrates when you come to a stop. And I've been told the same bs as everyone else, almost word for word. Do they actual have a pitch they say to all of us? I have filed complaints with everyone- PLEASE file your complaints. We need to speak out.

I have owned Toyota Camry's , Honda Accords , and other Nissan Altima's .
This yr Nissan Altima had the most dramatic improvement over all previous models built .
The quietness and comfort are over the top for this price range .
I compare it to a Lexus or similar car . The ride comfort is amazing .
I have less than a thousand miles so it is simply too early to talk about fuel economy .
But my last Nissan performed admirably regarding fuel economy . My old Honda Accord actually out did my Altima on fuel economy but rode like
a tank compared to my Altima .
Now the Altima is my preferred vacation car .
It also greatly helps with a Sales price and a low interest rate , It is a Winner

Transmission failed after 4 months of ownership and chest after 5000 miles. Started slipping on the highway and then completely failed. Engine light came on which owners manual says is a exhaust emissions problem. Now waiting for repair. I then have to make the 800 mile round trip in take time off from work to pick it up once it is fixed.Nissan will not transport. Transmission died over holiday weekend on the way to visit family.
