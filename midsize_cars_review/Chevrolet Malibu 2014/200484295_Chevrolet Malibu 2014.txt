I ordered my 2014 Malibu with all of the options and received it within a month (7 months ago).
It now has 18K miles and has been averaging 24 City and 32 Highway which is much better than the cars estimates of 21 City and 30 Highway.
It has only been in the shop for regular maintenance so far.
This is my first Chevrolet, but one of the many GM vehicles I have owned.
The interior is exceptionally quiet (not library silent like Buick), functional, and comfortable.
I have taken it down to Texas from Indiana and it is a great trip vehicle!
The ride and handling are far more superior than the Fusion, Accord, and Sonata.
I work for General Motors as an associate engineer, but am not biased

I believe the 2014 Chevrolet Malibu LTZ is a great car for the price.
The features are what you expect to find on a car costing twice what I paid.
Shortly after my purchase I took the car on a "shakedown cruise" to Laughlin, Nevada, about a 300 mile drive each way from my home.
The car performed flawlessly and I got just short of 30 mpg for the round trip, including a 20 mile drive in stop and go traffic on the return trip.
