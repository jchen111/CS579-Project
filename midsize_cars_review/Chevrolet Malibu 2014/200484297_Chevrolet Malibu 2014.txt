This is a very average midsized car. The auto stop/start system in this car has a few consequences that are worth informing future buyers about. There is no on/off button for the auto stop feature. The reason I am commenting on this annoyance is because the auto start/stop is way more noticeable then what the manufacturer says. It is very noticeable, the car almost feels like it stalls and then lunges every time the engine shuts off then restarts. Also, when the engine shuts off at a stop, the air conditioning gets very warm and the fan speed reduces dramatically. With summer temperatures in the 90's right now, it gets very warm in the car when the engine shuts off.

We took delivery of our 2014 Malibu 1LT in early January. It came equipped with the driver convenience package which gives me a lot of extra features such as 8 way power seat, rear vision camera, remote vehicle start, ect. Handling and ride are excellent. Road noise is almost nonexistant. The engine is quite perky for a 4 cylinder, which was a pleasant surprise. Although I was very concerned about the stop/start feature, it has performed flawlessly. It stops and starts so quickly and smoothly, I hardly notice it. It has loads of storage space and convenience features.. It is a very fun car to drive, and we are very pleased with our purchase.

 I had an Accord, son had an Altima, son in law had a Camry. Wife and I know the segment well. After lots of comparing, ended up going with the Malibu as the most car for the money without any compromises.


First tank of gas (highway) yielded 36mpg, as have subsequent fill ups. Stop/Start has engaged a few times, almost didn't notice.


Ride and cabin noise are on a par or slightly better than others in segment. Chevy My Link system works well with voice commands, bluetooth, and USB thumb drive music. Homelink mated up easily with garage door at home.


 So far everything works as advertised and we are very satisfied with our purchase.
