i enjoy the zippy buzzy 2.5 4-cylinder, it pretty sufficient of
moving the car swiftly. very nice ride for what it is, but can be floaty and too bouncy, while road noise is well controlled, rear seat space is smaller than i'd like but its not that big of a car. the biggest complain is the rear seats though. they are very hard and literally hurt me and my passengers, but no complaints with the front ones, they're rather comfy. the dash and leather are nice soft materials, but some dash parts seem just glued on and put on in a rush almost. the media system is also rather hard to comprehend and can be very confusing at first but becomes easier over time; also the stereo is pretty lack luster.

My company allowed me to order a new company car about 7 weeks ago. I ordered a Malibu 2LT black/black over both the Fusion Hybrid and Camry Hybrid.
It took five weeks to the day to get. I travel frequently and have rented all of them, but liked the way the Malibu drove the best. After a week and 1200 miles, I'm still glad I chose it.
Plenty of power (2.5), handles decent (I guess it's received some suspension, steering and engine upgrades since the 2013). More than enough room for what a I need.

Never thought I would enjoy a small car after driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee V6 but I love it.
I am still getting used to the shifting. We bought it mid January. Everything else is higher than me on the road but even in the Jeep there were many taller than me.
It has a Driver Leather Power seat. Good rear vision along with the backup camera.
Seems peppy enough but have yet to tromp on it to avoid accident. Interior is beautiful and blue lighting adds ambiance. Touch controls are easy and Screen easy to read.
So many new features and I love them all.
Steering is tight and responsive. For Auto/Stop everyhing has to be running in optium perfection. Warm engine, A/C and fans not too high.

 Have not had a small car for 13 years. Used to drive a Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Have had it for 1 month and use it to tool around town. No long trips yet. The Stop/Rest works occasionally.
Seats could be softer but the foam is dense so that's good. Blowers come on rather slowly. Fav Pages on Radio do not go back but must go thru 6 pages to go back to Pg 1. I feel it is shifting rough but may just not be used to the constant shifting. Support from GM and local Dealership is excellent.
They are trying hard to please. Every time I return from a drive I tell my husband, "I love the Malibu." It handles great. Learning all the fun stuff, Sirius, AllStar etc. No plain Jane this time.
