I took delivery in early December and now have about 3000 mi.
Car has all options except turbo and nav.
Did not desire either.
Prefer using reg gas and better economy.
Prefer using identical Garmins in all the family vehicles.
The techno safety features (blind spot, lane alert, cross traffic, collision alert, etc) are reason for buying car and they work great. I wish it had rain sense wipers, active cruise, locking gas cap, and rear heat ducts. Very quiet and smooth.
Not a performance car for handling or power.
I am a little disappointed with 30 mpg highway and 24 mpg city so far.
Hoping it improves after break in.
