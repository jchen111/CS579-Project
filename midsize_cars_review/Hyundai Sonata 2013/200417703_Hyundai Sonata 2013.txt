I love the car. I work with Dealers from All over the world. ( I do NOT work for a Hyundai Dealership) but I do work with dealerships from every vehicle type on the road. The only draw back is the passenger seat sits low. They need to put an adjustment control on the seat just like the driver seat. I'm 5'8" & driving so I didn't notice it until my sister who is only 5'1" said I can't see out the front window, so I gave her a pillow to sit on. My Father is 6'3" & he sat in the back seat with no problem at all. He said he had enough room to stretch out his Long Legs.

Bought new about a week ago. So far, the biggest disappointment is the sound from the stereo. CD's, Radio, Sirius all sound less thanb acceptable. There is a general muddyness that is going to result in having to invest in an aftermarket stereo.

Other negative is the "ride" is somewhat bumpier than I am used to with my '09 Accord and '06 Camry. You really feel every bump. Hoping that "breaking in the suspension and tires will help for

Positives are: layout of dials, controls. Nice the parking brake lever is not in center of console. The car performs well on turns, pick-up if fantastic (I do not use the "eco" mode). 

And the car is very sporty looking (I got it in black with spoiler)

do not purchase this vehicle if you want a good working bluetooth system. Upon our third complaint I receive a letter from Hyundai saying, "it is considered normal operation for the incoming call volume to be quieter than the audio level setting and to adjust the volume on certain calls". 
That nice, except you cannot hear the incoming call.
two other comments off their letter:
We are sometimes unable to produce an automobile with the features and materials that will satisfy or appeal to all of our customers.

If you prefer, you are more than welcome to contact the Highway Safety Association and report the concern to the Consumer Protection Agency.

This is our third Hyundai Sonata.
It gets just 
terrible gas mileage.
The two previous Sonatas
got much better mileage.
Went back to dealer and got this answer from 
the technician. There were no codes showing
a problem and 19.9 city and 27 highway is 
acceptable.
Called Hyundai and got nowhere.
This is not acceptable.

This is my last Sonata.

Owned gls with pop package for six months now.
Fantastic car in this segment.
Perfect performance everytime.
Remote start installed and have had 0 problems.
No adjustments, no glitches.
Tire noise on rough roads gets a bit noisy, but mainly due to low resistance tires enhancing road noise.
Smooth road....like butta!
Suspension smooth and controlled, but not floaty.
No rattles, squeeks, noises..(except loose objects in top of console will rattle.). Placed liner in and rattling stopped. Many dress up options on ebay, including chrome wheel skins for only 69.00 set of four.
Car looks expensive, but doesn't give buyers remorse.
Tons of room, seats comfortable.
MPG
23/35 avg
with eco.

This is my first Hyundai. So, far this car drives real smooth, looks great and I got a good deal! The customer service that I received at Freehold Hyundai was fantastic. I would have not purchased the vehicle, if it was not for the professionalism of my salesman Tom Tapke. The dealership should realize how valuable he is!!! Thanks Again!!

Bought my car in May.
Everything is excellent with the car EXCEPT OEM remote starter kit had major defect if installed in the 2013 Sonata.

Purchased kit during sale.
Needed to wait 4-6 weeks before 2013 kits were available.
When it was available, Hyundai dealership installed it but it failed (i.e., would actually turn engine off).
Dealership informed me wiring instructions were wrong from Hyundai.
Dealership kept car for 2 weeks and couldn't figure out problem.
Regional technician came in and also couldn't figure it out either.
Dealership removed unit and returned car back to factory default.
Finally got my money back.

I bought this car with the popular package which was pretty good with heated front seats, power drivers seat and alloy wheels. (Can't stand hubcaps). I also got the power rear view mirror. Overall, I am satisfied. The one issue I have is that the steering is electronic power and does not have the center detente. Wherever you point it, it goes. So it does not center itself when you let go of the wheel. This is OK when I don't think about it, but has a disconcerting affect if I do. However, for the money, this is a great car. I frequently rent cars for my job, and the Hyundai Sonata has always been a favorite. If you iphone, you will like the options. I prefer playing through bluetooth.
