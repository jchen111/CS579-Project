I bought a 2012 Sonota to replace  another. It had regular 3000 mile oil changes. I bought it to NTB for the last one in June of 2014.The sticker said to get oil changed at 58,000 He said it would be fine at 62000.No problems. I heard some  knocking  at 63000 so I had it towed in, I have a warrahty so I did not want to risk it, No oil light . No burning, No indication of oil issue, I thought it was a belt. I take i They told me it had burned through  almost 4 quarts of oil and it killed the engine. Mild weather Light driving, Reasonable oil changes a little past oil change date and this? The extended $1000 warranty won't cover it . They want $5000 to put new engine. Beware

I own a Hyundai Sonata 2013 Limited and have put 18 K miles on it. Hyundai Sonata is a solid car overall with a powerful engine, great design and several added features for a lower price. It also has very good safety ratings (which hopefully will not be tested while I am on the road). But to gain on these aspects, there are some compromises made by the company in making this car, which are pretty glaring and somewhat annoying. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I was shopping for a new car, I was only shopping because I was taking a new position, and mileage was a huge factor.
Bottom line, Hyundai advertised 35 mpg on 2013 Sonata, driving like a granny with almost 100% highway miles, the best I ever got was 26 mpg, but usually 25 mpg or less.
At almost 14,000 miles on it, I'm looking to trade it even though I have a wrap around 100,000 mile warranty with zero deductible.
I cannot drive a car for 100,000 when I was flat out lied to about mileage, for which they've already settle one lawsuit, and they still do it.

This warranty is a joke. It is not more than a selling tool. The quality of the car is poor. I spent more money repairing Sonata 2009, V6 than at Honda 2002. At 64000 miles the alternator had to be replaced as result if front valve oil leak. Contacted Hyundai who refused to pay for the cost of the repair. Trust me do not buy Hyundai made cars. The warranty is useless. Quality of the car is not good, oil leakage seems to be a problem with the Sonatas. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, this car is not worth buying. Plagued with rattles and wind noise right off the lot, and more importantly, the steering. The Sonata's steering is entirely too sensitive and requires constant correction on the highway. Don't let the dealer tell you it's because it has electric power steering, this is not why something is wrong with the steering. Go drive another car with electric power steering and you will find it to be worlds more comfortable to control than the Sonata. My arm is literally tired from keeping it in a straight line. If you go on a test drive, try staying in the middle of your lane; it is impossible. This steering problem is a safety issue.

Had been driving Toyota Camries for the last 20 years. The new 2012 Toyota Camry styling just did not do it for me.
I liked the Sonata exterior styling much more.
The car is good looking and fun to drive.
Rides nice and looks great.
The Nav option is very nice; only complaint being the special cord required for IPOD use.
The 2.4 engine is ample in power; a concern I had since I was coming from the V6.
Gas mileage at this point not great, but still in break in period.
Given that the Hyundai comes with a very good warranty it is discouraging and concerning that the dealer pushes hard on the extended warranty for a sizable sum of money; makes you wonder about the service aspects.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought this car on May 31st and we can't be happier. The Hyundai dealer was very professional and a pleasure to work with.

The Sonata offers very solid construction, great look, fun to drive, strong warranty, and fantastic gas mileage. Incredible value!

We initially considered an Accord or Camry, but thankfully didn't waste our time.
