My husband & I purchased this car in November 2013 and the brakes starting squeaking 6 months later and a pop noise when your driving . I took it to dealership on 3 occasions and they say it is oxidation and will not do anything and Chrysler will not either. We have always bought 
Chrysler and Dodge products but it they are not going to honor the warranty I will not again. I think if you have a new car it should not make noises

This is a
much better riding car than my 2008
Sebring Limited Hard top convertible, Quiet, softer ride and much more
comfortible seats. The motor
is so quiet you can not hear it running when
in the car. There is
a lot of power in this
 3.6 motor and seems
like better gas milage on the hiway than my 2008. The S
package is a real bargain for the price.Very sharp looking car, lot of compliments from people. the interrior is nothing to write home about but then i paid $12,000 less than an equal Sonata or Optima
 (chrysler promotion price was $ 21800.00 discounted from $27915.00 list price).Even the ford dealer salesman said
for what you get for the money you better buy the
Chrysler.
