Just purchased the Wolfsburg edition and I am absolutely loving it. Great handling and good power. I am also averaging about 28 mpg in mix driving. I'm sure it will improve as it breaks in. I love the interior. It simple but elegant. Fantastic value as I purchased it during the $1000 turbo rebate promo.
