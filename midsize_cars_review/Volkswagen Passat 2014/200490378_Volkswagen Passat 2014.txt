I sampled quite a few --Accord, Camry, Mazda6, Fusion, Sonata, etc. The Passat felt the most tuned in. I love the torque curve that kicks in a very low rpms. Up-shifts come quickly, which makes the Passat seem like it has long legs. I'm getting nearly 30 mpg in town. It really favors soft-pedalling the gas, but has plenty of juice when needed. Handling is excellent. Seats are comfortable. No squeaks or rattles. Soaks up bumps smoothly. Overall build quality seems to be right on. No USB port?!, so I bought a dual outlet converter. The Bluetooth works very well. Plenty of room. Stickered for $27,500, I paid $24,200, plus 0.9% financing.

What I love about his car is the Turbo engine.
Plenty of power when you need it and excellent fuel economy as well.
I love the way the car drives.
German engineered cars are just fun to drive period.
The seats are comfortable and the Cabin is extremely roomy.
I just love the way the interior is laid out.
The best thing about this car is the price.
I paid around 26k for an SE and I feel like I got a ton of car for the money.
I just don't think there is a better deal out there.

I got my 2014 Passat TSI SE in October 2013 and I like the car for its driving performance with excellent fuel efficiency.
I get up to 36 highway MPG and for my commuting route I get 33 MPG.
I noticed I get the best MPG when my speed is between 45 and 75 MPH.
I have 7000 miles on my car and lifetime MPG is 31 MPG.
 On my commuting route when I drive 2007 or 2010 4 cylinder Camry I only get 27 MPG.

I like the music system design that produce clear sound without a need significantly increase audio level while on the noisy highway.
I have driven Passat competitor vehicle and noticed high wind noise that makes it hard to listen to music.
