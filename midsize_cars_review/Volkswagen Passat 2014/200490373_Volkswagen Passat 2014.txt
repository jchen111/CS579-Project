Being in the market for a mid-size family car in the most competitive segment, I found the Passat quite a balanced choice. The combination of performance and spaciousness is very accommodating. The 1.8 Turbo breaths smoothly and effortless, marking a significant difference, especially when your weekend driving involves a few mountain ranges (which will surprise some V8 drivers out there).
The six-speed automatic shifts seamlessly (almost as a CVT without the retrofitting side-effect). Power is always available thanks to the engine's low end torque. In fewer words, I just love the driving dynamics of the Passat regardless of the package you choose.
