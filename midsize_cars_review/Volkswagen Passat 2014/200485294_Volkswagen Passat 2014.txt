I have owned 5 VW's in the past and this is my 6th and the last! Right from the start the back window had to be replaced because it was warped, bubbled and defective. Over a week in the shop. The Fender sound system is great but the top bar under the windshield cracks and rattles detracting from the sound. 3x times trying to fix that. The suspension crashes and bangs over bumps - going in for the fourth time to fix that! And, now the steering rack and column was defective - 13 days in the shop! And, what's up with styrofoam foam under the front passenger seat, foam packing in the trunk hinges?? Numerous rattles and creaks from the interior. What happened VW? Extremely disappointed. Stay away
