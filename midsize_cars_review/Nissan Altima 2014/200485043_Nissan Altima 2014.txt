Sport Package

Pros:37.3 mpg in 90/10 city/hwy driving (light foot), design, comfortable zero gravity seats, and lots of interior space. 

Cons: Starting with the 2013 redesign, Altimas moved over from the hydraulic steering system to electric which does not have the same "organic feel". The car wanders left to right and right to left requiring constant correction of the steering wheel on speeds above 65 mph which is major safety issue. Took it twice to dealer and they could not find the problem. Nissan markets the car as sporty, yet having owned a Maxima and 350z, the only thing sporty about the car is the exterior design. Has no steering feedback whatsoever. Will try Mazda next time.

I first tried a 2013 but didn't like it....really noisy.
After test driving other midsize cars and reading that the 2014 had more insulation added, I took the 14 out again and thought it was a lot better...and bought a 2.5S.
Unlike the 13's the 2014 S has a display audio package option.. (Rear view monitor...USB port....& 5" display) for $320...so I added that option.
This car has a lot of positives....nice compromise of handling/ride...Great gas mileage...No engine shudder like some 13 owners had.
Power steering noise once out of the garage is a non-issue for me.
So Nissan has corrected problems for the most part that the 13's had.
So the issues?
Read on.

Since my lease on my Nissan Sentra was just about up, I decided to go back to Nissan of St Charles where I originally leased my car to see what kind of a deal I could get on a new lease. I really love the Altima. This is my favorite Nissan model, but I knew I had to stay within my means so I was prepared to stay with the Sentra if I could not afford the payments of an Altima. Mariana, my husband and I went over what we could afford to put down on a 2014 Altima to lease for 36 months. Mariana and her manager worked with us and did everything they could to make the monthly payments affordable; gave us a great deal. Great customer service. Getting free oil changes and washes for 3 years too.

I decided to buy the 2.5S because it was by far the best value for the money
I bought it during the Presidents Day sale $5000 off MSRP Driven for 600 miles in three weeks
Found nothing wrong it (so far)

A CVT is louder than a traditional geared transaxle - just the way it is
The electric pump for the power steering will make noise
I can accept each of these issues because I own a 2005 Prius which has a CVT and more than one electric pump

The Altima is a great value
Very little road noise enters the cabin - except for the engine's roar
Good initial build quality
Nice styling inside and out
Solid feel
Generally comfortable ride

I have owned many cars in the past including last a 2010 Acura TL.
After renting a Nissan Altima and driving it round trip over 1200 miles for a trip I was sold and got rid of my Acura and brought the 2014 Nissan Altima S with the Sport Value Package.
I absolutely love the gas mileage I get from it I easily go all highway driving over 600 miles before needing gas and the features are great for me not too many not too few features.
I think it has a great ride and looks impressive.
I get lots of comments on it and so far after purchasing it in mid September I have only had oil changes necessary and anticipate no problems in the future.

The Nissan "Build Your Own" site makes the 2.5S options tempting and I opted for these options.
OMITTED from the 2.5S options was the overly harsh Sport Suspension.
I am embarking on a very unhappy three year lease.
Traded a 2011 Toyota Camry LE that drove like a luxury car, now when I run over a dime in the road I feel it.
