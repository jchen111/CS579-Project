1st off, I am a Toyota Salesman.
I own a 1956 Ford Victoria, a 1970 Chevy Chevelle SS 396, 2002 Chevy Silverado and 20 days ago, a 2014 Toyota Camry SE 4 cylinder w/17" rims.
Now, I am used to vehicles with big muscle and horsepower...crappy MPG just goes with the program...when I first saw the 14' Camry SE in Cosmic Gray I fell in love.
What a sexy car.
Now, what would make me think about purchasing a 4 cylinder car?
All I have to say is drive one.
This is a fast car that, in my car, is giving me 29 MPG.
Sexy style, comfort, power, quiet, excellent handling, value and it's gonna last 500,000 miles.
Try that in any other car besides a Honda.
The ride is affected with the 18" rims.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some journalists have referred to the Camry as an "appliance". A toaster toasts, a washer washes and a car drives. Ho Hum. Is that supposed to be it? Is that all there is for all this money we have to throw at a car purchase?

After 2 Corolla Sports, (2003, 2010) that I found economical and fun to drive, this car isn't. It has a big boring car feel and absolutely no personality. Numb is the best way I can describe it. Yes, it has a nicely appointed interior, is fairly comfortable and seems to have enough power. It is better looking, especially in the front end, than its LE and XLE siblings. But that isn't enough anymore. This is just a very reliable point A to point B vehicle. Ho Hum.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test drove the LE and SE, I actually liked the steering feel of the SE, but the LE ride much better.

We settled on the SE since the wife like the trim.

I will say, the SE steering is a bit too sensitive.
I tend to drift on highway, and it jerks when I make adjustment.
It maybe my driving pattern.
