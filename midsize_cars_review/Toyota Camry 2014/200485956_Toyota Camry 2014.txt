I bought my new Camry L 2014 a month ago.
I was going to get a Corolla, but the dealer had a 20% discount on all Camrys for that weekend, and I decided to go for it.
I would be VERY happy with my new car except for its very poor MGP fuel performance.
Driving with the ECO on all the time, I am hardly getting 20.5 miles per gallon in city!
How can this be?
How can Toyota
get away underrepresenting Camry MPG for almost 20%?
I have read other owner comments on this issue at this site and I am shocked to learn that some Camry's are making 26 mpg in city.
Is my car an anomaly?
Is there anything I can claim to my dealer about this? What can I do?
Suggestions welcome.
