I've had the 2013 4-cyl. Legacy Premium for about 7 months now, and love the car.
Picked it up for $22k including the all-weather mats (recommended).
The main reason I bought it was the AWD, since I live where it snows a lot.
The car is a beast in the snow, even with the regular tires.
It was 11 degrees today with the car sitting outside, and it started without a hitch and plowed through about 5 inches of snow on the driveway to get to the street.

It has plenty of room - it's larger on the inside than it seems from the outside, and the trunk is large too.
It's comfortable, solid and well-handling to drive.

Ruined. Just. Ruined.

When I bought my '07 Legacy, I fell... in love. The car had an understated elegance. There was an attractive aerodynamic look. Exterior lines flowed, interior lines flowed. Materials, though not
luxurious,
were high class. 

The fabric in the seats was classy *and* robust. The doors were rimless. The center console employed a minimalist design that made it pleasant to look at and easy to use.

The Legacy has... changed. It now resembles a Ford sedan. The aerodynamic of its tail has disappeared. The doors are rimmed. The seat fabric is cheap and thin. Heck, all interior materials are cheap. The center console is overdone and resembles Optimus Prime. Optimus, go away.

It's got ho-hum styling inside and out.
It's been rattling/squeaking since about a week old.
It gets slightly better gas mileage on the freeway than advertised.
It's comfortable.
It has lots of room inside, even for tall people; more head room than every other mid-sized sedan that I tested.
It has plenty of power at almost any speed.
It's a little noisy at freeway speeds.
The blue tooth works well, but I would change it.
The CVT is a little weird since I can't tell what speed I'm going by the sound of the engine.
The 6 gears are a plus for fuel economy.
The paddle shifters are cool, but automatic works great without them.
However, I like my 2004 Mazda6 better in almost every way!
