I traded in a 2012 2.5i Premium for the 2013 2.5i Sport for the new performance upgrades.
The best way to describe the '13 model is disappointing.
I can't question the AWD performance of a Subaru, it handles almost any road condition with ease.
The acceleration on the '13 is sluggish from a stop but crisp at higher RPMs.
I think the acceleration on the '12 was better overall.
I was averaging 31 mpg with my '12 and only 26 with my '13.
The Sport interior isn't all that impressive, the seats may feel softer but they also show dirt and lint far worse than the '12 interior. The new suspension is stiff and bone-jarring at times.
Camry's run the same 18' set-up with a much smoother ride.
