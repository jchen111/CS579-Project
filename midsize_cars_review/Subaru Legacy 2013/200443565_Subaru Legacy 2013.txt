I narrowed my search down to two cars, the Subaru Legacy Sport and the VW Passat TDI.
Both impressed me but living in Vermont, the AWD made the most sense.

I must say I am very impressed with the Legacy Sport.
I am averaging over 31 miles per gallon with mostly highway miles.
Great looking car and handles very well.
 Sport has 18 inch wheels but wish it had 16 or 17 inch wheels which would cost far less when I changed tires.
Ride is nice and smooth though with the sport model, I suspect the regular Legacy models have less stiff suspension. 

My family has owned several Subarus and have never had a problem. 

Highly recommended !
