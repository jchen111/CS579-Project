My wife wanted the Subaru Legacy for quite some time. Finally when it came time, I decided I would give one a try. We bought it with the plan to keep it for 6-8 years. The first thing I noticed when test driving was the strange feel of the seat on the back of my thighs. It was irritating for maybe a few weeks then I stopped noticing the seats were different from most vehicles I've owned. I drive about 17k miles a year. Probably 45% hwy and 55% city. I am impressed still with the mpg. It seems like I rarely have to fuel up. I get avg about 26mpg and I'm not trying. The back seats are large and passengers find them comfortable. There are though too many things I hate about this vehicle though.

Our new 2013 legacy is fun to drive, looks great and is comfortable. I come for a long line of SAABs and am spoiled by great seats, the Legacy isn't as plush but they are firm and offer very good support. The Nav system is better than our Honda Odyssey. On my first tank of gas I've averaging 25.2 in mostly city driving. This is the Limited model w/ upgraded stereo, works great w/ my iPhone 4s, downloaded my phone book w/o issue. With a EQ few tweaks, it sounds fine. I had shopped the Impreza but the Legacy is just more car, quieter on the road, better seats and stereo. Very happy w/ my choice.

Very worthwhile investment.
With 3,000 miles on the car, I am getting 33 MPG on the Hwy and 21 in the city for a combined 27 MPG.
I got the navigation with Eyesight and the Harman Kardon stereo and it makes for a much more attractive dash layout. This car is a blast to drive!
The boxer engine has a nice note under heavy acceleration.
The seats are very comfortable front and back.
The HVAC works excellent, and the controls for the Bluetooth, nav, handsfree, and audio system are very easy to learn and use.
Steering is tight and responsive.
Build quality is excellent - no rattles or squeaks at all.
And snow?
This car loves it!
It sticks to dry, wet, or slippery roads like glue.

Bought a 2.5Limited w/moonroof...after about 1500 miles, I'm pleased.
I was skeptical about going to a 4-cylinder, but it seems to have plenty of power around town and on the hwy...it works well with the CVT, which is one of my favorite features-smooth acceleration.
Interior is well laid out and very roomy - front and back.
Seats are comfortable and the Harmon-Kardon sound system is great. Simple, clear ipod interface and bluetooth connection.
Build quality is excellent.

I had
the 2010 Subaru Legacy and it was a great car so I got the 2013 Legacy. Big mistake.
They changed the suspension and now the car has a harsh, noisy, jittery ride.
From a great car to a lousy one.
I get 17 mpg city, 34 highway.
There is no noticeable improvement in handling nor any improvement in mpg. OEM tires are not good. They're noisy and neutralize any benefit you get from an awd vehicle. Subaru lost me as a returning customer. Will not buy/lease one again.

After weeks of serious comparison and review, I settled on the Subaru Legacy as a new car
purchase. The fit and finish is fine and the car is very comfortable and has excellent room for passengers. It is a mid-size vehicle. The car handles well and very little body roll in sharp transitions. The dash layout isn't as pretty as some competitors but the seats are excellent and the Harmon/Kardon optional sound system is good. Interface with iPhone was easy. My only disappointment at this stage is MPG, it isn't returning what I expected. The CVT is smooth but I didn't see anything close to 32 on the HWY on my first road trip. I'm not a heavy foot driver and not a jackrabbit start or stop driver
