Got a great vehicle just about 2 years ago, and still love it.  Had some difficulty on color choice because apparently they don't built as many cars as what I was used to (chevy Malibu) but I am still happy with my choice. Met a nice guy camping in northern Michigan that had one and was raving about how good it was in snow and he even let me drive it around down the road and back. Got mine in August of '13 and so far so good. I do mainly highway driving with my cruise set at 60-62 and I've been getting 31.2-31.5 MPG at the pump.  Only complaint is the trip computer tells me I'm getting 34.1 on average...I WISH!

Subaru has great idea with AWD feature and high ground clearance. Gas mileage is good and sound system is great. Nice interior and appointments.
The car has heavy steering and some wandering adds to fatigue after traveling long distances. The car uses excessive amounts of oil between oil changes. Dealership dismissed my complaint. Told me, "they all use a little oil". Found out recently, there is a law suit pending regarding the issue. May not purchase another Subaru due to this issue.

I agree with all points of the review by cmlsudbury. 

I've got the dark interior and it does show every mark, especially where shoes hit the door panels.
Not sure this would happen in other cars with similar color scheme.

I hate the AUDIO/NAV system.
I wanted the backup camera and you had to get the AUDIO/NAV to get the camera.

I feel totally ripped off for the price paid for this upgrade vs the value received.

Software upgrade had better be a warranty item.

Only 7500 miles so early days on reliability.
Dinged Interior Design and Value because of the audio/nav system.

Very good in all respects EXCEPT 1) the choice of interior (both light and dark show every single mark, especially along door where low entry almost guarantees your toes will mark the lower door panel) and 2) the AUDIO/NAV systems (which are easily the least-intuitive and most frustrating interfaces I have ever used in my life). They are so bad that they deserves a recall to fix the software

This purchase (2013 Limited with Special Appearance package) was the culmination of 2 years of research (I keep my cars 12-15 years, 200k+ miles).
A big change from my mid-size 4WD SUV; I'm loving the driveability and handling.
Just as roomy inside except not as tall as my old one. No road wandering I've noticed after 2500 miles including 2 road trips.
2.5 is more than enough for me, although others may want more. The other finalists were Volvo XC70 and Audi Q5, although they cost $$ more and were nicer trimmed of course.
The OB feels just as solid on the road.
Honda CRV AWD was the only close-price contestant and the OB felt much more solid. I liked the CRV's front storage though

Swapped my 1991 Acura NSX for this--wife wanted an SUV and I wanted a junk hauler. Have always admired Subaru for being unique, but poor gas mileage in the past kept me out of them. They've apparently solved the issue recently. We're getting better than EPA estimates, which is quite good for this size vehicle. The Outback has grown a lot since being a station wagon Legacy. It's now a full-fledged SUV, although, unlike most SUV's, it is sporty and utilitarian. Handles much better than expected (despite reviews I've read). Corners flat unless driven excessively hard. CVT is really quite good providing you adapt your driving to the way it works. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My wife has a 2010 Legacy and has 84,000 miles on it and she can get over 30 MPG, easily. I have 4500 miles on my 2013 Outback and I easily get 29 MPG, sometimes over 30. As far as the mileage concerns I feel it is the way a person drives. The car is not meant for spirited driving. If you want that, buy something else. It drives tight and very predictable, although the gas pedal is a little touchy when accelerating from a stop. The ride quality is very good, a little firm but I wanted that over a soft ride. I did buy the limited for the Harmon/Karmon radio because the base radio really sucks as far as sound quality. I'm 6'3" and the little added height to the Outback makes it easy to exit.

Love the car its my 2nd one!

We are Subaru people.
I've owned 5 in the past decade. While we are basically happy with our 2013 Outback, we don't enjoy it as much as we had hoped.
 Our 2013 Outback Limited 2.5 CVT replaced a 2010 Outback Premium 2.5 CVT. We traded in the 2010 for the nicer interior, better color, and "bonus" 1mpg.
While we love the Limited's
features, after 18k miles the MPG falls well short of the EPA estimates. With the 2010, we got 75k miles worth of 30-31mpg 70mph commuting. That's 1-2 mpg better than the sticker. With the 2013, we struggle to get 26mpg. Dealer says car is normal. Had I known this, we would have bought a 3.6R and gotten more power and avoided the dreary droney CVT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is our second Outback, the first being a 2006.
What's nice - the interior styling, the very good AWD, and FINALLY rear air vents (at least in the Limited) that have been available on non-US Outbacks for years.
But they did stiffen things up a bit and this is described by some professional reviewers as improved handling.
In real world driving, it means that imperfect pavement (really normal pavement these days) is always there with you.
It's not bouncy, just hard.
Which brings me to the interior plastics - tap on them with your nails to get a knock on the door sound.
The materials seem fairly cheap aside from the seating surfaces.
A lesson from recent Toyotas?
