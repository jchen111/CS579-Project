Performance? is Meh, but it can handle fast bumpy on/off ramps with sublime decorum. Roll on speed 40 to 70 is fairly respectable for a family Wagon, and upshifting/downshifting is far smoother in the CVT...Hooning lightly around town in the snow will reveal one startling realizaiton...downshifting with all 4 wheels engaged + traction control on snowy roads is surreal! If your in this car on snowy roads, watch your back at icy stop signs and intersections; getting rear ended by those who cant possibly stop as fast is a real issue. Still too new to judge reliability..Add snowtires and go nealry everywhere in the snow. bottom line: I feel safe with my family in this car in all conditions.

Needed a new vehicle and read tons of reviews as well as drove a lot of crossover type SUVs.
We were impressed with the Subaru's safety ratings and consumer reviews so we bought this 2013 Outback.
We love it!
Gas mileage is awesome.
34.2 on highway so far and around 24 in city and it's not broke in as yet. Only downsides: the beige cloth seats get dirty easily so get seat covers ASAP; air conditioning is a bit hard to regulate. It's roomy and comfy inside.
I have a horrid back and find that I'm not getting as stiff and achy after riding in this for long periods of time.
We're very impressed with Subaru!
Owned a Honda Accord before.

Just bought this car and absolutely love it for the exception of the Bluetooth. Had a Hyundai before and the Bluetooth worked great. On the Outback it is totally annoying. Will not dial by name or number. Had other people in my family try it and and it is a joke. Shame on you Subaru!

We've had our 2013 Outback since the Winter and its been awesome. The suspension was definitely stiffened up this year which can make poor road conditions more noticeable but high speed and back road handling is spot on. Our latest road trip was 400 miles to NH and we averaged 33.6 MPG with 3 people, cargo and lots of mountain roads. We've hit a few off road trails and the car has tackled mud and dips with ease. The interior is quiet, spacious and the harmon kardon audio is very good. No issues to date!

I like the uniqueness of this car, I'm glad they priced it sensibly.
It is really good value considering the capabilities and quality you get.
I like the elevated stance & feel it gives you when driving.
Love the ground clearance.
 The clean look from underneath with nothing hanging down.
1st tank all city was 24.7mpg.
2nd tank mostly highway@80mph w/4 adults 25.9 mpg -both hand calculated.
The CVT is awesome.
I drive manuals too but this is a great transmission. Keeps rpm's low in most situations and offers good thrust.
This car is a pleasure to drive. Quiet. Solid.
I am a fairly critical car person and do my research.
