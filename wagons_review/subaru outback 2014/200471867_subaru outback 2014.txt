I traded in my 04 Highlander for the Outback, primarily because I needed a small SUV type vehicle that would get better gas mileage, and be comfortable on trips etc.
This Outback met all my expectations.
The seats are very comfortable, gas mileage is better now that the engine is broken in and the Chicago weather is warming.
I get about 27MPG in mixed suburban/highway driving with the 2.5 engine.
I noticed that the mileage suffers when the engine is cold (runs richer) and can take some time to warm up on real cold days.
Constant short trips will kill gas mileage, fyi.


Engine has plenty of pep which was an initial concern and I was impressed on how quiet and refined it is.

The winter has arrived along with half a foot of snow, ice, and -20 wind chills - a perfect time to see what my new (just a month old) Subaru is made of.
 

Happy to report that it's more than up to the challenge. Drove it this AM through ice covered hills and it held its own nicely. Even at the intersections,
where I used to sometimes slide around in my previous vehicle (Honda CRV), the Outback holds steady. And, it's fun to drive!

I really like this car, I've been looking into it for the last couple of years. All of the merits fit what I've wanted it for. Lots of room, reasonable gas mileage, car-like handling, off-pavement ability...

This car gets it done, after the first couple of weeks getting adjusted to sitting up higher than what i traded in, (2013 Buick Regal GS) I took it on a road trip 400 miles each direction and was very happy with it's comfort for the trip. The seats are great,supportive yet soft while not creating circulation hot spots over long periods, the driver lumbar support is actually very, very good as well.
