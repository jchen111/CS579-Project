i did lots of research looking for a car that combined practical space, versatile in all weather conditions, cross-over aspects, a sense of adventure but confidence....something different from the hundreds of dreary over-sized SUV's out there. always knew Subaru were renowned in the AWD adventure/sport category but was surprised by how versatile the Outback is.

always liked the idea of an adventure vehicle like the Outback something fun and versatile. i had no idea how captivating it would be. perfect ride height, super-stable all wheel drive (almost invincible in the snow), adequate power, great space and rugged looks. my wife and i fight to drive it and may have to get another as second family car. we are outdoor fans and love the rook rails and easy level load bay and space.
