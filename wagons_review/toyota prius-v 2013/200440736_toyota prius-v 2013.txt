 I bought my Prius V for its roominess and fuel economy.
Then I found it lacked a lot in handling. Better than a Prius sedan but lacking.
Luckily I found "Juiced Hybrid" in Redwood City, CA and the parts I needed to make it go better and handle. 
I've installed:
1. an underfloor center brace 
2. 17" ENKEI RPF1 wheels
and will install:
1. front and rear sway bers
2. strut tower bar
3. front underbody stiffener bar
4. cold air intake system
I've installed some electronics mods:
1. Prius V specific LED fog lights
2. LED running lights (in the grille)
3. shark fin antenna (body color matched)
4. LED interior lights
5. hard-wired line for my Garmin GPS

After 2500 miles, MPG is averaging 43+.
Car is roomy, surprisingly comfortable and even has enough power to not be a problem.
When the power button is pressed between 35 and 65
the performance is surprisingly good.

So far no issues at all just pleasant motoring - even from a person who prefers the European/German type ride and handling.
