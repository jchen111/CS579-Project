It took me awhile to wrap my head around the fact that Honda is putting out a better product than Audi & BMW.  Honda seems to have overbuilt the  Crosstour to ensure it would attract the attention that it is getting.  No flaws.

My husband and I wanted to upgrade to a larger, safer, 4-door vehicle. We looked at smaller SUVs and station wagons. In fact, we almost bought the Subaru Outback 3.6R, however the gas mileage was not impressive at all. Our FJ Cruiser gets better gas mileage than that. And the quality was...ok. 
We happened to pass by a Honda dealership and seen the Crosstour out front. I had to test it out and to my surprise, it was everything we wanted and more. What a comfortably smooth ride! I have been averaging 23-27 mpg, depending on traffic. The interior is incredibly comfortable and the looks of Crosstour is very sleek. I feel like I am driving a very expensive, luxury car.

This is our second V6 AWD crosstour.
We have a severe floor board shake at 22mph- 30mph.
If you in stop and go traffic - the car will even hesitate along with shaking the floorboards and gas pedal.
This is a major design flaw and it's much worse in normal drive then in S drive - using the paddle shifters.
 The car also shakes real hard at 70-78mph on the highway as - tires are balanced

This is a Engine and or Transmission design flaw.
Had it in our 2010 and now worse in our 2013 - The put the VCM in the Acura RDX and people are complaining about the same problem. 

I'm just waiting for something to break loose under the hood and cause a accident.
HONDA FIX YOUR MAJOR DESIGN FLAW
