I decided to downsize after driving SUV's for many years.
The hatchback makes for an easier transition.
I owned a Honda Accord Coupe many years ago, but did not like the new style.
I am so glad I found the Crosstour.
This car looks great, sporty but still a four door.
I am shocked at the reviews criticizing the look. I looked at the Lexus and the Infiniti, but didn't really want to purchase high octane fuel.
I don't drive my personal vehicle to work.
It's so fun to drive, I can't wait for the weekend so I can get in my Crosstour and go!
I love that there are not very many of them on the road right now.
I absolutely love this car.

Just bought "13" Crosstour.
It was the only car that filled all our needs.
Build quality is flawless.
We are first time Honda owners.
Loaded with tech goodies that all work as they are supposed to work,
not like Ford's MY Touch by MicroCrap and GM's gouge you every month OnStar.
If you are not a race driver
"want a be" and don't want to spend 50k on a Benz or BMW show me a car that does what the Crosstour does without breaking a sweat.
