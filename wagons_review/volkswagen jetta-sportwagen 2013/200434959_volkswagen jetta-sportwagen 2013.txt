It is as other reviewers say, the car is a pleasure to drive. Road handling and braking feel very good. The interior details have good fitment and visual appeal. Controls are simple and uncluttered. Another reviewer says he chose the top end with Nav (which is actually a step down on radio/entertainment features, be aware of that) somewhat because it is combined with keyless entry/start, and I was motivated that way as well. Diesel MPG exceeds expectations. Note: stowing rear seat cushions to get a flat cargo space has a feeling of flimsiness about it, and required removal of rear headrests for this operation is a very inconvenient procedure.

We purchased our new TDI Sport Wagon March 8th 2013. Our new Jetta is quite, smooth and powerful. This car is very satisfying to drive on the highway and around town as well. If you are looking for a safe,relaxing and economical vehicle you need not look any further.
