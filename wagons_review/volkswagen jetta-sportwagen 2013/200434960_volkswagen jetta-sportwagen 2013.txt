If there is a 'have it all' car on the market this is it.
 
-Over 40mpg
-32cuft of storage (seats in place!)
-Available with manual or DSG
-tow over 2k lbs

Interior design is fantastic, night driving is a pleasure, dash is very pleasant to look at with the white lights black backdrop.
Insurance rates are lower on this car then any hybrids ($200 a yr less then a Prius for me), more then pays for the extra cost of diesel.
 

The navigation system is so-so, but I knew that when I bought it from the test drive.
The only reason I still went with the top end nav package is because of the KEYSS system,
never need to take the keys out of my pocket is sweet.
