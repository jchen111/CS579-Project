Updating my May 2013 review

Great seats for long drives.
Excellent lumbar support.


I'd like full power seats, but at least the power seat back adjustment is a great idea.

Mileage:
Great.
Recent trip:
Palm Springs to Oakland:
35.5 mpg.
Marin to Ventura counties:
37.5
Ventura to Palm Springs: 39.5
This is not the TDI, so although I'd love the additional power of the turbo, the excellent mileage has compensated for the 2.5.

Bluetooth works well, although I did have to have the dealer pair my phone to it.
They were happy to do it and I have to say that VW service has been excellent from VW of Palm Springs.

There was one manual S available in all of Southern California when I was in the market. While I loved the response of the TD, I just couldn't justify the additional $5-10K. Plus, I live in the desert, so I really don't have any desire for a sunroof.


This car replaces a 2009 Subaru Forester, a reliable yet gas guzzling AWD, with no power & awful seats.

I don't regret not spending the extra $ for the diesel because I'm consistently getting 33-35 mpg/hwy, 26-28mpg/city.
I drive 60/40 hwy/city. 

After 5 months, with 5K miles, I'm thoroughly enjoying this car.
Though this is as basic a Sportwagen as one could probably find, I got a lot of car for a very reasonable price.
