I've had this vehicle for almost two years now and it's been a very fun vehicle to drive!! I have the Prestige version and it's fully loaded with blind spot monitor, rain sensing wipers, upgraded stereo. What I love most about it: Bang and Olufsen stereo..really sounds great, panoramic sunroof, heated front seats, power liftgate.
What I don't like about it: seats aren't the most comfortable, and the rear seat leg room. Also the options can be $$$ when you move up in trim levels.
Other than that, the Allroad is very fun to drive!! I haven't had any major problems with it in the two years I've owned it.
