Being my first truck I had no known expectations.
I checked out the Ford F150, The GMC, The Chevy Silverado, Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan.
Dodge was not even on my list.
After reviewing the trucks above I decided it was between GMC and Ford.
On the way home from test driving the Ford for a second time I pulled into the Dodge dealership and was introduced to the Dodge Ram 1500 Big Horn Quad Cab.
Even before I test drove it I was immediately impressed with the features and the overall impression that the trucks interior was much larger and wider than the other trucks.
The I took it for a test drive and once again I was amazed at the difference in comfort this truck has in comparison.
