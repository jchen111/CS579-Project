I've got 8000 miles on my truck now, it's white with gold two tone, with the cattle tan interior.
I intentionally avoided the laser etched filigree seats as to me, it would have been too much country. Options I have are the 8 speed rotary dial transmission, the multi-level air suspension, Rambox storage, and each of those options to me are an absolute necessity when getting this top of the line model.

I'm not a pickup guy but they've gotten so much nicer over the last 10 years that I reconsidered. I'm also a Ford guy and swore I'd never by a Chrysler product. But the Ram 1500 has great styling and features across the whole line. The Longhorn is just nicer looking than the tip-top F150 Limited. Head-turning styling with rugged good looks outside, and a luxury car interior.
