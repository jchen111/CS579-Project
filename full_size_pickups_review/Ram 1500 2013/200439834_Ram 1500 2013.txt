Can't believe that this is the truck of the year!
Have about 2000 miles on it and have scheduled second trip to dealer to try to fix the radio.
The touch screen goes black and I can't control the radio.
I also have had on several occasions where when I turn the key nothing happens.
If I take the key out and try again, then it will start.
Not very comfortable feeling if I want to take it out into the woods.
I will give it credit for fuel economy with the 6 cyl and 8 speed transmission.
Not sure if I like the dial shifter.
In light of the other electronic issues I am not confident that will not become an issue down the road.
The ride is good, the paint was not the best quality

I bought a brand new 2013 RAM 1500 and must admit that it was my first brand new purchase for a vehicle. I got a couple blocks away from the dealership when all of a sudden steam and smoke started pouring out from under the hood. I looked down at the temp guage and it was slightly below the red mark. I pulled over and popped the hood and found a rad hose not attached to engine. I called the dealership who sent a tech out to meet me (later found out that the hose is given a plastic peice at the factory to assit in assembly and it was never removed causing the hose to fall off under pressure). I spoke with the dealership and Chrysler Canada and was told too bad basically, your stuck with it.
