Last week I bought a Ram Express 1500 Crew Cab with the Hemi and 3.92 rear end.
It rides like a dream!
I only have 500 miles on it, but got 19.3 miles per gallon on a 150 mile round trip.
Average between city / highway is 17.4 mpg in the first week.
Not bad for a 395 hp V8.
I didn't try Ford because I just couldn't justify the price difference.
Already own on GM product and it has been in the shop more times than I care to mention.
Plus the V8 just doesn't have any balls compared to the Hemi.
I am hoping this truck will pull my 6000 TT with ease.
Already installed a BedRug and Access Tonneau cover.
Also hoping it is reliable.
But first wekk has been great.
Rock on Ram!
