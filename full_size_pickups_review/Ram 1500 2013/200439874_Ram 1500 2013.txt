My husband & I bought a 2013 Ram 1500 V8-Hemi fully loaded Lonestar package 6 months ago.
Electrical problems: Ram box, glove box & reading lights inoperable; Cruise control & traction control dash lights staying on. Mechanical: Check engine light came on due to a faulty injector -required replacement.
Not once were we offered a rental car although we purchased the add on comprehensive Zurich vehicle service contract. All repairs required 3 different visits lasting multiple days. We just learned the odometer is reading at least 15 miles above driving speed. We will return for our 4th repair visit tomorrow.
We traded a 2003 Dodge ram we drove 10 years that we loved. Very dissappointed!
