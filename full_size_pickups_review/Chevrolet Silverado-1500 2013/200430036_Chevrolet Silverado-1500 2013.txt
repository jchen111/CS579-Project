Overall, the 2013 Silverado 1500 is a good truck.
It's not necessarily the fastest or most powerful truck out there.
I tend to look more for reliability and easy to use (especially when it comes to internal electronics--radio, cruise control, etc).
Yes Fords have the newer tech in some areas, and their trucks are faster and but I like the tried-and-true engine that GM tends to keep using (ie. the 4.3 Vortec which has been around for the past 2 decades or more).
The 6-speed automatic w/ manual control and the 5.3L V8 is a very nice combo to get for moderate towing and fuel economy.
Crew cab provides enough room for adults in rear seat.

Even though the interior is a little behind it is still very functional.
I bought the 4x4 z71 and absolutely love it.
It rides great, sounds great and has plenty of power.
Being able to fold up the back seats and have basically a flat floor makes it very useful to put things in the cab or simply have a flat spot for the dog.
This is my first Silverado and hopefully it will make me a believer!
