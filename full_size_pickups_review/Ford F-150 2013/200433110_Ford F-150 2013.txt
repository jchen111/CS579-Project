Love my truck!
I just got a 2013 XLT 5.0 V8 and love driving it.
I test drove all the other trucks in this class and to me, the F150 felt the most solid and drove the best.
Even the RAM, which seems to be the reviewer's car of the month that they are gushing over didn't come close to having that commanding feeling that I got in the 150. Silverado didn't come close. Toyota tundra would have been my second choice, as it was a couple grand cheaper.

I wanted eco boost, but went with the V8. Have friend who bought eco boost and the turbo shut down in damp weather on the expressway..seems to be an issue that government is finally looking into....a lot of complaints about it. Still love the 8
