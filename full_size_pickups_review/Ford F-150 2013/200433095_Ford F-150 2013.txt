 Love the truck itself BUT check out the wheels on the one you buy before you buy.
Mine has 18 inch what I thought was stainless.
Turns out to be easily damaged steel with a plastic insert that looks like chrome but is junk plastic.
Mine had big chunk out at 13000 miles from the car wash I think.
Dealer told me to " buy new wheels, not their problem"
Ford complaint line told me the same, not their problem.
No more Fords for me.
Also never ever got 22 MPG.
