They didn't have an option for 3.5L Ecoboost FX4.
I just got done towing a 28ft 8,000lb trailer to Yosemite National Park and it pulled it with no issues, turbo lag or trouble getting up 7%+ grade hills.
I had a 2010 with the 5.4ltr v8 and it had trouble pulling the travel trailer even with the 3.73gears.
In towing I got average of 12.5mpg. I usually get 15.5 in city and upper teens for hwy but I work in a hilly area so I'm getting better then I expected.
I was a little worried about the Ecoboost reviews from the '11 & '12' models but looks like they worked out the kinks for '13 but I leased the truck just in case.
If you need a truck that can tow alot & get v6 mpg's, this is the truck!

I don't have the ecoboost, I have the 5.0 V8; but it's not an option on this form.

The ecoboost is truly amazing, but has a limit on it's high end and tends to just thrash.
The 5.0 is in my eyes even more amazing.
From 0 - 110 it's just pulling and tugging with an aggressive roar.
Love the seats, Sony Subwoofer, sunroof, and Navi.
Touch screen and auto start logic are great, with auto handling of defrosters and seat temperatures.
