With less than 14000 miles on the vehicle I noticed both front tires were wearing out on the outside edges only.
I told them that I wanted the camber checked.
I took it to my dealer and the told me that my tires were under inflated.
I pointed out that under inflation would wear out both inside and outside edges not just one.
They told me that the tire settings were okay and there wasn't a problem.
I can't afford to spend nearly $500 every 15000 miles for two new tires.
Please be careful when buying this truck because it can get expensive real quick for things that should not wear out quickly.
