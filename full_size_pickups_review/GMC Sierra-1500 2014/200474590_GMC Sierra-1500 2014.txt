Just purchased my new 2014 GMC Sierra with all the bells and whistles just a step below a Denali and wow, this thing looks nice, but really it is very similar to a truck I had many years ago.   There are a few pieces of technology that are a nice upgrade (when they work), but they also skimped on some of the basics.    As shown below some of the items that were standard items years ago are not even options today.   The iPhone USB interface is hit or miss with IOS 8.0.2.   Sometimes when making/receiving calls you get hand free, sometimes you have to use the phone itself.    Also the heads up display is just a red flashing light, no information shown.  Maybe next year...  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seems to be numerous mediocre reviews of the Sierra/Silverado on here, and I fully respect each one.
But I also felt obligated to offer up my experience to date.....one that is been very positive.
 I shopped all of the light duty V8 4x4 trucks, and can say objectively they're all good options.
What sold the Sierra for me: ride quality.
I have none of the vibrations mentioned in other reviews. The Tundra is close, but the road noise is much more pronounced.
Interior: Subjective I know, but this 2014 interior is more ergonomic, user friendly, and more upscale than Ram, Tundra, Ford.
MPG: I am a consistent 22MPG on highway. Price: Spec for spec, $6K less than others with GMC incentives

Just over 40,000 miles on my 2014 SLT crew. I'm 75% freeway driving.A few recalls taken care of, bluetooth issues, and replacement of poor quality OEM tires, that sums up the repairs it's needed. The factory headlights are sub par, I replaced the factory bulbs with ZXE units with great results. I'm very impressed with this truck overall, it's getting an average of 20 MPG on mostly freeway miles. This truck feels like a Lexus compared to the F150 it replaced, very quiet and smooth. Comfy seats, and a nice ride are also welcome. Great truck overall!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Edmunds review does a good job of describing the trucks good sides.
OK, now for the downsides.
The throttle response on this truck is an absolute disgrace.
There is a delay before your right foot's motion changes acceleration.
That and the transmission's obsession with getting into the highest gear possible makes a sluggish combination during normal driving.
A downshift sometimes takes several seconds! If this is all for fuel economy, I could possibly understand, but the economy, so far, isn't much better than the 2005 5.3 Avalanche this truck replaced.
Maybe because I'm pushing this truck too hard trying to get it to respond to my right foot...
Shoulda got the Ram...

I think you owe us an apology. You seemed to think the 2014 GMC sierra was a decent truck. I would like to let you in on the problems that most of
the people are having with these trucks. Many rattles inside truck,FM radio can't hold a strong signal even sitting still, I have the Bose system and all I get is very nice sounding static.(think it is on purpose to make us buy XM) The headlights are so dull we are afraid to drive at night as they only light about 3-4 car lengths ahead even on high beam (no actual high beam light just a filter that moves to let out more light). Rear shocks that leak and make noises. Water leaks to the interior. Power rear sliding windows that the cables break and

I wrote the review "looks good, drives poor"
Here an update with 4000 miles. The truck has continued to be a disappointment.
I had to replace bolt rear shocks due to leaks.
The drives seat broke, twice.
I'm not a huge guy about 160 lbs and the seat keeps breaking.


Drivability of this truck is poor, shifts are still very questionable both upshifts and down shifts.
On a recent 650 mile highway drive, the truck shifted quite a bit on cruse at 74 mph.
Average mpg on trip 17.3 Awful.
MPG has declined and I average about 14.8.
Compared to my 07 5.3 Silverado its about 3 mpg less.


Maybe I got a bad one, but how many bad ones are out

Have had 3 fords (last w an ecoboost so spoiled on torque) and only now coming back to GM. Had a silvy that was rock hard in terms of durability... But rock hard plastics in the cab sucked. I came back after creaking and lackluster workmanship in the ford turned me off.
Silent cab. Not quiet.. Silent! Wife is actually ok w me adding new pipes! This is a z71, All Terrain, so very nice interior and fitting of a lux car.
Outside is all business. Nice, subtle change for gmc; modern look that grows on you and doesn't betray the heritage. 5.3 is much stronger than the old one and you can't feel the v4-v8 switches.

Picked up my 2014 GMC SLT Sierra (Z71) today.
It is black with black leather interior and chrome galore- including 6 inch running boards. I also put Line-X in bed of truck.
The truck is a head turner for sure. There is additional room in the backseat, improved door seals make this even quieter than the 2011 Chevy Silverado I taded in for the GMC. I've driven around all day and cannot come to grips with how comfortable the ride is.
GM hit a homerun on this newly designed 2014 truck.
