I have owned my new LOADED 2014 Nissan PRO-4X TITAN for about a month and couldn't be happier.
Yes the MPG is not great, but I knew that.
I saved around $7,000 by choosing a TITAN.
I looked at a RAM 1500, Sierra and Tundra all comparably equipped and all were a minimum $7,000 more.
The money I saved I will use for fuel.
And by my calculations, it'll take me about 7-8yrs to breakeven.
The tech inside is fine.
The interior is fine.
The ride is better than all and the steering and handling is great.
Its all subjective, but to me it works.
Go scoop one up before the redesign and they jack up the prices.
