I, like many others, have a crew cab with the shakes. Once you get up to speed, you will feel it in the steering wheel, seat, console, and floor.

There are quite a few others with this problem and GM threw many parts at their trucks (tires, rims, driveshaft, TCM updates, rear axles) and they still shake and vibrate. At least they received some attention from GM, because I was basically told by my dealer that this is a problem with the trucks and GM has no fix.

Throw in about 6 recalls, one tailgate cable longer than the other, a radio that sometimes works, and an interior that is so cheap, it scratches and rattles just looking at it.

I just purchased the Silverado 2014, less than 1500 miles. It squeaks each time it changes from 4 to 8 cylinders. Dealer said that nothing could be done. They could repeat the problem but said that GM had no resolution. This is most annoying to say the least. I'll track each time I take it in for repair; if they continue to say it can't be fixed I'll file under the state lemon law. Too bad, really was looking forward to my new truck.

I loved this truck at first.
Great ride, fuel economy and interior comfort/features.
I'm starting to have several issues of major concern.
My truck starts very hard in cold weather.
Several revolutions of the engine before it'll fire up.
Getting worse.
I also have a distinct coolant smell coming from the truck after it's gotten warm.
There is a vibration I've noticed at freeway speeds in the drivetrain that's starting to drive me nuts.
I also have to bring the truck into the dealer for 2 recalls.
My windshield has cracked and I don't believe it's anything that I've done.
GM spec'd the glass too thin to save weight???
The truck is a bit jerky to drive through various speeds.

This is a very nice truck with a significant safety issue if you need adults to ride in the back seat. The head restraints do not move up high enough to protect someone over about 5'3" during a rear end impact. My 2005 Sierra crew cab had restraints that moved up considerably higher. I registered a complaint with safercar.gov and emailed a complaint to Chevy Customer Service. I have also written a letter to Chevy explaining my complaint. I did receive a response to my email saying thanks for the feedback and it will be taken into consideration in future designs. This is unacceptable. I and others have the unsafe current model. If I would have realized this, I would have bought the Ram.
