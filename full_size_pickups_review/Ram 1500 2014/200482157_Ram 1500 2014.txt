I should be doing a commercial for Arrigo as this is the 6 vehicle I have purchased from them in 8 years. I had a 06 Ram 1500. Traded it for a 09 Ram 1500. I didn't like the truck. Loved the way it looked, hated the way it road. Talked to John Arrigo during my first oil change and I ended up buying a new (leftover) 08 3500 Diesel Dually. Loved the truck but wasn't using it for the things it was intended for enough. Sold it. Just purchased this truck a few months ago. Got the basic Tradesman with the 5.7 liter Hemi. Great truck! Pulls my 6x12 enclosed trailer with my HD Road King and gear like nothing is behind it at all. Quiet, well put together and made for work.
