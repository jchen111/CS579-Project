This is one nice machine - I went from a Avalanche & was concerned if it would be less of a truck. Not so, very pleased so far w/more power & equal mileage. Haven't done any towing as yet but it seems more powerful in general driving.

It is a big truck w/the crew cab but very serviceable. No hint of bear-tracking in snow & no problems w/control at high speeds on rough road surfaces. no vibrations & very smooth drive train 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coming off of three-straight F150 platforms ('07 Lincoln Mark-LT, '09 Loaded Lariat, '11 Platinum) I decided to take a break, but that triumvirate set the bar high ('11 Plat was the nicest half-ton I ever drove.)
Well, the past is the past. This '14 Longhorn simply outclasses the Fords across the board (for now, until FoMoCo stops resting on laurels.) Gorgeous, comfortable, luxurious, powerful, intuitive technology...it has it all. The "Western" themed interior is a little over the top (a bit long on badges and saddle-stitching) but it's crafted so finely, it's hard to say that there's something else you'd prefer.)
Here's the new bar for Ford, Chevy and Toyota to jump over. Good luck boys!
