The 2014 Ram 1500 EcoDiesel is a machine worth purchasing.
I have driven the truck for 2,500 miles and I am totally impressed with the interior ride and quality and the fuel mileage (25 to 30 mpg).
The truck has great storage compartments to fit my tools, bikes, boys' baseball stuff, and suitcases.
I have not yet towed my Wrangler for 4x4 excursions, but I am sure it is up to the task.
Mileage is phenomenal, around town I am in the 21-23 mpg range, on the highway around 26-27 at 75 mph or 30 to 31 at around 67-69 mph.
This is tested and verified by me.
The interior is quiet, 1st class, and the hands free system is excellent.
