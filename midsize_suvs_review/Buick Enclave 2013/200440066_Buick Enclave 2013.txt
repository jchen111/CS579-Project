Traded my 2011 Cadillac SRX
Performance model Seats were to hard and harsh ride. Found seats and ride in Buick put Cadillac to shame. Much more solid on road. Handling is excellent. But for $53,000 list price. The cheap plastic decor inside this car makes it really look cheap and poor quality I am not sure I would purchase it again.

Have had our Enclave for 1 week and absolutely love everything about it. The interior is much more plush than the 2012 model. The quiet cabin is as advertised. The ride is so comfortable it is hard to describe. The led rope lighting on the doors and dash are classy. First time we got the articulating headlamps and this actually helps enlarge the area of lighting when turning. The rear entertainment system will be well used by grandkids.
The Intellilink is user freindly and awesome. The spaciousness for all 7 seats is impressive.

I just leased a 2013 Buick Enclave with Intellink. 
I had a 2010 Enclave and loved it.
The Intellink is all touch buttons including the Emergency Flashers located just under the radio. When
changing the radio I inadvertently touch the flasher button and turn them on . This happens daily. Fog lights are no longer available. I used them all the time.
You better check with Buick to see which Smart Phones will work with Intellink. It cost me $600 to purchase a new phone when after several days and phones call I found out my HTC Rezound would not pair up. The Iphone 5 will not either. Surprise!
Now that I bought a new phone Pandora still won't load.
