Roughly 8 months ago, I traded in my 2012 ford flex limited for a 2013 Ford C Max Hybrid. (I had owned a 2009 and 2011 Ford Flex previously)
Although the C Max was OK, I found that I wasn't
driving enough miles to save that much gas money. Was giving up a lot of room and comfort, so went back to the Flex. The Ford Flex is by far the favorite car of my wife and I.
I am a retired automobile sales representive, (30 plus years) and have owned and driven many makes and models.
