I just purchased a 2014 Sorento LX V6 AWD - What a great value!
I purchased a new 2011 Sorento LX 4cyl my wife is the primary driver of. We both liked the vehicle; still have it. Had a transmission input shaft fail under warranty, but the service was top notch. 

The V6 is very strong, and the vehicle is very quite at all speeds. After doing a lot of research, this remains the best bet for my price point.
