Having now driven this car as a primary for 27k miles, this car is a good one. Easy to work on, even if you're a backyard mechanic. Lots of room, even for a family of six (all small children). Downside, there's not a real trunk space if you have the third row. Positives, plenty of extras even on the base model, pre-drilled holes for mounting aftermarket towing kits and side rails, plus it gets better gas mileage than a minivan. So far, no major maintenance has been needed.

We purchased our 2013 Kia as my wife was looking for a mid-sized SUV. We looked at Honda,Nissan and several other but for the price range we wanted to stay in the Kia Sorento was by far the most stylish and offered the best standard features and Warrenty.
