Love my Sorento.
It is one of the best looking SUV's out there.
I have gotten 27 MPG on the Hwy.
I took a trip camping with 4 girls and all our gear and got 24 MPG.
This is partial hwy and partial mountain driving with plenty of steep grades.
I use the ECO option to keep my foot and pedal in check.

Had my 2013 Sorento for about a month and love everything about this vehicle. Have owned Nissan, VW, Audi, Honda and the Sorento beats them all on interior design and comfort as well as handling (with exception of course of Audi).
Every possible bell and whistle and perfectly executed.
Handles like a dream in snow and ice. MPG slightly lower than I expected but still quite good for a vehicle this size.
Hands down my favorite car yet, test drive the Sorento if you're in the market for this type vehicle.
The other tipping point for me was the third row seating, awesome for hauling my nephews and their friends and when folded down provides terrific cargo space.

I love my Kia Sorento V6!! Never thought I would purchase Kia but after disappointment over Subaru, I thought I test drive Kia Sorento and boy was I surprised! The vehicle drives like a german car. Very solid, smooth, great horse power and love the sharp look of both exterior and the interior. Kia Sorento V6 is better than BMW 5X. Why? Better performance, better price and sharp looking. I was really surprised how well the vehicle drove. It has everything that the BMW 5X. I am extremely happy with the vehicle.

The Kia SUV has been more than we expected, I traded in a SRX Cad. and didn't think it would hold up to such a nice riding car, but it has made us happy about our investment. We are pleased the car is made in the USA what a bonus.
