I hate this car.  Plain and simple. My previous Rav 4 had this beat by a mile.  Radio failed and replaced before 35000 miles.  Slider panels covering full length moon roof rattle open with normal driving vibrations, leaving my grandson baking in the sun in the back seat or the sun baking the leather seats.  These panels are automated in the Rav 4.  For $38000....they should be automated in the Kia Sorento.  Air conditioner has a high pitched squeak to it when run on high.  Worst of all are the headlights...can't see at night when on normal beams, even with fog lights on.  When I ride with high beams on, no one even flashes their lights at me.  Mileage ok, poor pickup for a V6 compared to Rav
