With our 3rd boy on the way we had to move on from our 2 row Endeavor. Having studied Consumer Reports extensively and done
some somewhat recreational test drives of numerous other vehicles I narrowed our search to the Durango, Acadia, and Sienna. Our priorities that ruled out others such as the Highlander, CX-9, and Explorer were: we had to have captain chairs in the back, good reliability, regular fuel, enough space in the back for kid stuff, MPG better than 18, power lift gate, black/dark intirrior, and good safety features.

I traded my 2007 GMC Envoy for a 2014 Acadia.
I am disappointed that the vehicle does not drive nearly as well as the Envoy.It is jerky in response.
Also, there is no memory seat function for the power seats, which, in my case, is a major aggravation since more than one person drives my car.
And, there is no light in the glove box.
You would think that a car that cost this much would have these features.
I think I want my Envoy back!
