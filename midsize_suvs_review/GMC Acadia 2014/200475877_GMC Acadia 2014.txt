First, good luck at actually finding anything but a base SLE1 model if you actually need an 8 passenger AWD vehicle. The dealer searched and there were no SLE2, SLT's, or Denali AWD 8 passengers (or Buick Enclave's) within 500 miles on dealer lots and nothing in the production queue without having to wait for a special order (at much less of a discount). But after driving a 7 passenger Denali, we are glad we just took a base SLE as there really isn't that much to justify the 14k difference in price and huge difference in residual value.
The problem is with the premium trims like Denali, there's really not that much 'Luxury' to justify the price difference.
