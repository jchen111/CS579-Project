Leased 9/26/13.
After shopping and test driving a whole bunch of cars, I decided to stay with Murano for my 4th time.(39 month lease)
The CVT is unmatched for a smooth ride and the addition of a navigation package was smart idea on my part.
I gave only "average" ratings on design because it's been unchanged in 10 years, not a negative, just not anything new.
The Blind spot monitoring is a great feature, although it'll take me a while to trust it.
Build quality and reliability on my last 3 Murano's has been perfect, I've got my fingers crossed that the 2013 model continues that trend.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've only the this SUV for a couple months now and have put on about 3,500 miles.
I love the way it handles.
 The V-6 has enough power for my liking, along with the CVT.
It is a very quiet and smooth drive compared to the 2011 Rogue I had before.
Love the techology package and the panoramic sunroof.
 The manual says to use premium fuel but we've been fine with regular.


Overall,
I have no regrets with this vehicle.
I like the exterior style, although I know it's not for everyone's taste.
The fit and finish inside is excellent.
 I will write another review after six months.
