This is a very smooth quiet riding Crossover which I like better than the Explorer that I traded.
I get about 19 mph around town and about 25.5 mph on a trip with the standard 285 HP engine.
The seats have good support and it gives me plenty of power on the Western PA hills.
I have just driven this about 3,000 miles and my only criticism is that the automatic six speed transmission is rough on occasion.
Fortunately my SE does not have the busy MY Ford screen of which everyone complains.
