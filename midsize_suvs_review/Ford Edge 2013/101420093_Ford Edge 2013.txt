I've had my 2013 Ford Edge since June 2013. I've traveled from Ohio to South Carolina 4 times to see my granddaughter, daughter and son in law. I couldn't be happier with the comfortable ride. The My Touch does take a little bit of time to get use to, but I have
not had any problems. I would recommend going to the Ford website and watch the tutorials, There are also nice YouTube videos. I highly recommend this vehicle.

I have been wanting to buy an Edge for some time now.
I love the looks and the ride.
2010 and older, very bland interior and dashboard not even easy to see.
No back up camera available.
2011 many impovements on interior and dash.
However, I can't get used to new turn signals, turning on and cancelling.
That is not natural.
Especially if you still opwn a vehicle which works the way mosy of us are ude to.
Also, I have no faith in MyFordTouch.
Too many bad reviews and no positive fixes.
Plus, playing with this screen is just as bad as texting and driving.
Give us back our dials and buttons.

I recently moved from a 2010 Nissan Murano LE to the Ford Edge Limited with the 302A Package. I loved my Murano and got rid of it due to an accident. I had an Edge as a rental and liked it so much I ended up buying one =)

Honestly I considered another Murano but it hasn't changed since my 2010, I was looking for something with a little more technology. I considered the Chevy Traverse and the new Pathfinder but settled on the Edge.

Almost didn't buy because of negative reviews of Ford My Touch; glad we didn't listen to them. My Touch is the easiest system we have encountered. Our Mercedes 350 GLK had a terribly awkward Nav & Communication system and the Cadillac SRX we had before that was just as bad. My Touch is extremely user friendly and the center stack with multiple information is excellent. Vehicle exceeds our expectations for quietness and fuel economy. Seats are a bit stiff, and even with the 10-way option don't tilt enough to get really comfy on a trip. Unlike our Benz, this car actually has a rear seat that adults can use. Best bang for the buck that we've had. Would definitely recommend.
