Best car for the value. If your on the fence about the exterior and interior design compared to its competitors. Check this car out in person.
It will most likely surprise you.
My previous car was a mitsu galant. With everything original in tact with over 220k miles. So I know and trust their engineering.
As long as you do the regular maintenance and don't submerge it under water or hit some deep pot holes at aggressive speeds this vehicle should be reliable.
You should never have to rely on their warranty but it's nice to have as a cushion/ peace of mind.

When you compare any vehicle priced under $25k that comes with 5/60 bumper to bumper warranty, 10/100k power train warranty, comes with back up camera, heated seats, bluetooth, roominess and 26 mpg combined, there aren't many that can compare. With the 2014 Outlander SE, you get all this and reliability of Mitsubishi. Yes, it's not a sports car. Yes, it doesn't have cutting edge design. Unlike other vehicles in its class, it's very quiet, is comfortable, handles reasonably well, and has all the safety features you'd expect for lots more. We researched lots of vehicles for what we needed and couldn't come up with a better solution for the money.
