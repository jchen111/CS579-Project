My 1st Ford ever, I'm a 40 yr old woman, driving all my life. What I hate about the Explorer: the harsh ride on bumps when you're going over 20mph. It's a soft ride at very low speeds. Also the insulation is insufficient and you hear every pothole very loudly inside the cabin almost like a wheel fell off or something. I also HATE the rattling, squeaking, noises it makes from the dashboard and console area at only 8,000 miles. I only drive on roads, can't imagine how it will fall apart if I actually went off roading.
Also, on a cold day, the ignition refused to turn on when leaving from a grocery store one day. Called roadside assistance. Car hates cold, makes weird noises till it warms up.

This is my last Ford. I have had nothing but problems with it over last year! Ford service doesn't know how or cant fix the long list of issues. Pathetic! The navigation doesnt allow anyone to use it while driving, even passenger, and is super complicated. I use my phone now. Hvac is all messed up, locking on hi heat while on max low a/c. Fuel feed hesitates when accelerating so it nearly gets u into accidents when quick acceleration from stop or in traffic needed. Too many other items to list. Please avoid at all costs. I paid for leather and nav $2200 outta pocket as this is company car and I was gonna buy it for wife after 70K miles cheap. After 45K, I just want rid of it! Hate it!!

I use this vehicle private and for business (agriculture).
The AWD works very well for driving around on fields. Only the front spoiler under the bumper is quite low.
The room is enough and it feels very roomy. Somehow this Explorer is really fun to drive.

I purchased a 2013 Ford Explr XLT 2 weeks ago. After test driving the vehicle I did not notice the lack of leg room as I was too busy playing with the MyTouch and working the mirrors to even bother. On my way home after purchasing the vehicle, I had a cramp and went to stretch out my left (non driving) leg. It was met abruptly by the "dead petal". After I got home I tried many ways to reduce the "dead petal" but could not get it to work with my size. I am only 6'3" which is taller than average but I am no giant. I wouldn't recommend this vehicle to anyone who is taller than 6 feet. My mother's 2002 Explr has all the leg room in the world. Not sure why Ford made the new ones so small.

38 yr old female owner of the 2013 XLT 4WD-V6 since 04/05/13. Very disappointed with the purchase. Ride quality is very harsh over potholes, you feel and hear all potholes. Road noise is loud on old and rough stretches of NJ roads. Poor sound insulation. Headlights are not bright enough. No remote start or push-button start on the XLT costing $39,040. 2nd row seats are small, do not provide enough comfort, thigh support to adults. 3rd row very hard and heavy to fold and unfold. Jerky transmission going uphill. Fit and finish is very poor -- door molding, seals, compared to my 2010 VW. Steering buttons are very cheap quality. Gas tank door does not lock.

Have owned my Explorer for a month now and have logged just over 1,200 miles on it and I can assure you Ford hit a home run with this one.
Not a single rattle or squeak, a very solid vehicle.
Have not had a single issue with the Sync or the My Ford Touch.
Touch screen is very responsive and my iPhone 4S syncs up every time with no call issues.
Road noise is only an issue on rougher paved roads or highways when using the Sync during a hands free phone call.
However it never overpowers the call.
Would appreciate a larger, more powerful engine, however the 3.5 is plenty large enough for everyday driving.

I just discovered that the Ford Sync in my 2013 doesn't support any USB Broadband Modems. This makes this Sync feature useless, and I can't setup my Ford as a 'HotSpot' inside the vehicle. The only way is to 'Tether' your phone, and pay ATT an additional monthly fee.

I must admit, I really love this car.
This is my third new car purchase.
My last car was a 2005 Honda CRV, and the 2013 Explorer is a great upgrade providing plenty of space for my family.
However, after owning the car for only two weeks, following a heavy rain, I was hearing what sounded like water sloshing around in the car doors and dashboard.
I also discoverd that the carpet underneath the driver door was saturated. I took the car back to the dealer today and was told its unusual to happen in a new car, and that I must have parked it under a tree to cause a clog?!? In any event, after indicating it was fixed, its not.
I don't know if this is a model defect, or just my bad luck.

This is'nt your daddy's Ford thats for sure! WOW! I have had the pleasure of owning a Ford Ranger, Explorer Sport Trac and an Escape (all leased vehicles) and this new 2013 Explorer not only sets the standard for others to follow, it has its fingers on the pulse of what Americans want in a Made in the USA vehicle. it's about time Ford and an amzing job! The ride, the ammenities, the quality of the interior and exterior and the comfort are outstanding in my book, the Explorer is a tad bit shy on the towing but 5,000 lbs in a 7 passenger, wil still allow the urban family to get away for a weekend and the gas won't hit you in the pocket. Give it a look and drive. You won't be disappointed!!

I've had it for about 7 days, and it is fun and comfortable to drive.
We almost bought an XC90 and I'm happy we didn't.
The front seats are two side by side Lazy Boys and the technology package is overwhelming.
I've already experienced a locked screen and a few disconnects but nothing that my iPad or iPhone hasn't done to me.
Anyway, the car looks awesome, drives awesome and has a bunch of fun technology in it.
This is my first Ford in fact it is my first American Car.
I would have never considered a Ford ever and here I am, a happy owner.
Hopefully the miles and time will be kind to it.
This isn't the Explorer that I remember.
