I have a 2013 Ford Explorer Limited and it's great to drive! I really enjoy it! Sometimes I wish it'd accelerate faster but that doesn't take away from how gorgeous and luxurious looking it is!! The interior quality is very luxurious and well done! A MAJOR upgrade from it's older model. This is my second ford and they never seem to disappoint. I know longer drive my '07 BMW because I'm enjoying this so much!

I have the Limited 202a package with 22,500 miles and is performing as advertised. Most of the Neg. comments are AWD models or Base models. You get what you pay for! My sync is excellent and you need to be a little Comp. savvy, if not you will have some issues, but all in all very minor. The Optimo H426 tires if pressurized to tire manufactures specs 46 psi they give a rough ride, but if you tone them down to ford recommendations at 35 psi the ride is much better. As far as room, I'm a huge dude and I have plenty of room. The people that are complaining need to by a van and need to get a clue! fold the third row seating down and there is plenty of room for four people plus cargo.

This is a truly marvelous SUV. Styling is a head turner w/20 inch wheels, well sculpted body and body creases. Corners great with its unitized body and the interior coddles its passengers with plush leather seats, an ABUNDANCE of space in all rows, intuitive tech features and a wonderfully clear, 13 speaker stereo. I love the solidity of driving in our nasty Chicago winters while the terrain management system makes short work of 10 inches of untouched snow and my wife and I are treated to heated seats, satellite radio and warm cocoa. Summers are also a treat under the dual sunroofs. This car was designed heavily based on the Land Rover and I swear somedays I forget that it isn't one!

We just bought the 2013 Explorer Limited and I cannot say enough about this vehicle. The interior is simply beautiful, even compared against the luxury brands of Mercedes, BMW and Lexus. There have been a lot of complaints about the My Ford Touch system, however as long as you load the latest firmware update (via USB), then you will have no problems. Ride quality is very good, although it can feel a little firm with the 20 inch alloys than come standard on the Limited. The cabin is spacious while at the same time feeling very cozy. We have the captain chairs in 2nd row which makes access to the 3rd row much easier. Highly recommended. The 3.5l V6 really packs a punch with good fuel economy.

Really like the room & Technology of Sync & MyTouch on the controls. I know a lot has been said about Microsoft & MyTouch but it's easy and I have not had any problems. It feels like the future and using a new smart phone when playing with the navigation screen.

The 3.5 V-6 engine has plenty of power and the cabin is very quite & smooth ride with the 20 inch wheels. It's more than I expected when you compare the price with import luxury models.

 One Test Drive is all it takes !

I bought a 2013 for explorer LTD. was very happy to buy my first new car.
But, when I drove through wet weather, all the dirt and mud is getting inside lower portion my all doors. I guess the gaskets are missing or not properly aligned. I went to the dealer ship and was surprised to hear that "This is a common problem and that is how the ford has designed. You have to live with this." Who would like to see dirty doors every day when they open their new car. Atleast I am one of those. I called the Ford customer relations and all they had to say is they honor they dealers judgement. Wow......
They 1 of my tires blew and dealer didn't agree to honor the warranty & ford said the same as before.

I traded my wife's 2010 F150 for the Limited plus everything.
She was disappointed in performance of the V6 vs the V8 in the F150.
However even with her lead foot, she has managed to get between 20- 21 mpg.
Excellent compared to the 16- 17 mpg in the F150.
I have averaged 24- 25 mpg when I drive.
She loves all the features and has found the MFT (My Ford Touch) to be easy to use....
She struggles with the IPhone.
Overall great trade and no issues.

Purchased vehicle in Fort Myers FL and had accumulated less than 400 miles on same before undertaking our trek to extreme Northern NY... the car performed very well and the mileage improved as we drove.
Ride comfort and seating is superior.
The car has 302a pkg, so all of the toys and features apply...forward facing radar is truly impressive in high speed traffic situations.
The blind spot detection works very well and the lane minder too, had to play some to find out if it worked.
Had one incident with the closing rate detection on the radar as a panic situation occured in front of me, the heads up display and braking assist performed as they were designed, added to my feeling of safety
