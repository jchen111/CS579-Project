I recently purchased a 203 ford explorer.
This was my very first ford and will be my last.
Do not buy this car if you plan on driving at night on anything but a very well lit road.

It has been back to dealership several times, everyone
that drives it concurs that the lighting is an issue, but since Ford says it is a character of the car nothing can be done, even though they have received numerous complaints. 

The lights perform so poorly that my wife will not drive it at night. 

I am hoping this posting keeps someone else from making the mistake I did.
