Everything on this car breaks or is a "software problem" that Ford admits there is a problem but they don't have the fix for.
 Transmissons lights are on, does not detect the key, the My Ford Touch system is a joke and a waste of money.
They haven't been able to repair it for 4 years and now they are going to another software provider.
Bluetooth sound quality is horrible and I travel a lot for work and drive a lot of different cars.
Drive a GM if you want a reliable car with a simple bluetooth system that is crystal clear.
 This is my 3rd Ford and my last, their quality has gone down hill and they have no interest in improving it.

Much to my frustration the Explorer has been an epic fail on both. Even with the EcoBoost it averages under 17 mpg, and as for snow it is one of the worst vehicles I have ever driven in snow. 

I get stuck in my driveway with as little as 1Â of snow. I canÂt make it up an incline without the wheels spinning even though all my neighbors can get up the street with no problems. 

Even with the traction control off the car makes grinding noises when the wheels spin. And to turn the traction control off you have to go 4 menus deep.

I also have issues will it hesitating when pressing the gas and the GPS. Half the time is doesn't remember settings.

I have had 2 prior Explorers and a GMC Envoy SUV's. These were great cars but no where near is nice as this 2013 Explorer.
The vehicle is very comfortable, quiet, roomy, yet not that big. It drives and rides like a car and tows like a truck. We can fit our grand children's car seats in the second and third rows and still have room for the adults. The seats flip and fold very easy. It tows my 3500 lb boat with 6 people effortlessly. My touch-sync is great. Needed a couple of re-boots but now is great.
Getting 23 MPG highway and mixed driving 18, much better then prior SUV's. My 6'3" son in law was comfortable in every seat including the third row with his 5 year old son in a car seat.

I bought this fully loaded Explorer Limited through the Costco auto purchase program and picked it up at the Ford dealer in Helena, MT.
Drove it home (about 200 miles) then made three trips to the airport.
The "check engine light" went on after about 300 miles.
I took it into Ford and they told me they needed to completely dismantle the transmission in order to replace the defective torque converter.
This is a BRAND NEW CAR.
I don't want t new tiorque3 converter, I want a new car and so far nothing from Ford.
Buyer beware.
This was a known issue and my new car is sitting at the dealer.

I wake up every day thinking about driving this car.
The touch system is fantastic and understanding it should be fairly simple for anyone who has ever used a computer (or an ATM for that matter).
It flawlessly syncs with my phone as soon as I fire it up.
The interior is beautiful and well designed with a lot of forward thinking.
My kids love the adjustable ambient lighting.
I have the 2nd row captains chairs which makes getting to the 3rd row very easy.
My only complaint is that the gas tank (and range) seems small (and short).

I rented this car for a week and can't figure out who would buy one. We wanted a vehicle that could comfortably seat 4 people and 2 children in car seats. We could not install the car seats and have access to the rear seat. The middle seat does not slide. Rear seat too small to hold car seats.
My 6'4" son had to crawl in thru the liftgate. My Ford Touch System - Overly Complex. Transmission had a constant wine. Turn signals needed to be pushed 2 clicks up or down to stay on. Large Turning radius made parking a chore. I own a Mazda CX9 - this SUV can't compete with it. Check out and drive the competition before you buy this. Beauty is only skin deep.

This is my 4th Explorer Limited in 10 years. Ford has out done themselves with this one. I could not be happier with ride , comfort , performance , and all the new and latest technology. This one rates right up there with the very expensive foreign models. The My Ford Touch is a really addition to the electronics. I highly recommend this vehicle.

We go this car 4 months ago and in that time it has been back to the garage 8 times for them to try and fix the My Ford Touch/SYNC system. It still is not fixed and Ford dont know how to fix it.

The car itself is lovely but if you want the SYNC system to work then dont buy this car.
their solution to the navigation not working was to buy us a Garmin!!!

no buy back, no switch out and no cash compensation - very dissappointed with Ford and their technology that doesn't work

My previous car was a BMW 5 series. We wanted something utilitarian to support our lifestyle with two kids, visiting family, road trips to the mountains, beach etc. Minivan was out of the question. We could have spent $70K+ on a comparability equipped Benz GL or Audi Q7. We netted a fully loaded Explorer for $45K - a great value in my book. We have 5,000 miles on it over 6 month and it's been positive.
The car does not provide a thrilling driver's experience like the 5 series does, but that's not what you get this car for. We will put the $25k we saved over a benz/audi and put it towards a real drivers sports car as our other car.

I just bought a 2013 Explorer with a tow package with the intent of occasionally needing to rent a trailer as I had done with my previous vehicle (a 2009 Edge).
I found out after the purchase that U-Haul has black-listed all model years of Explorer and will not rent towable equipment that will towed by any Explorer.
This fact was not know by the dealer.
