I bought my 2013 Venza LE AWD last April, so I have almost had it one year. 
Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I liked the exterior design when they 1st came out several years ago.
The inside of the car is very roomy all around. The kids have plenty of space in the back and the car is wider than most. I am a pretty big guy, so I appreciate the width of the drivers seat. It also has a nice large trunk.
The electric steering take a bit to get used to (feels a little loose at first) and this car also rides pretty rough compared to most American-made cars. You really need to take it for a long test drive before you buy it. 
This car is absolutely amazing in the snow.
