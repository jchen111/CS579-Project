I have had my 2013 Venza for a month now.
It's a great car, but, two complaints.
The Buick SUV I traded in rode much better and was much quieter.
First complaint - the radio - my goodness, what a tinny sounding unit (not the JBL).
Tried all the settings with no great improvement.
My new Ford Escape has a much better radio.
Other complaint - rough ride and noisier than my American cars.
Sure seems like the much vaunted Toyota could do better than this.
Will probably go back to American brands after this.
If you are looking only at Toyota - look at a couple American brands - you might change your mind.

I just went over 1,000.00 miles on my 2014 Venza XLE FWD V6 after owning the car for 20 days. The most impressive thing about this vehicle is the 3.5 L V6. It is powerful, relatively quiet and works seamlessly with the 6 speed automatic transmission. I am averaging just over 20 mpg in mostly city driving thus far. I have observed up to 30 mpg on the computer in short highway trips traveling at 60 and 70 mph. (Hopefully these figures will improve even further as the engine gets fully broken in). 

The only negative that I need to write about is the jarring ride on rough pavement. Toyota must do a better job tuning the suspension to complement the 20 in. wheels. 

I like the roomy cabin.

I owned a 2011 Venza, 4 cycl., and purchased the new 2013 Venza, XLE, 6 cycl.,Nav. Leather,power rear door lift, rear camera, 20 inch wheels.
I love this vehicle, the ride has improved... My commute to work is 35 miles one-way, this vehicle is a joy yo drive.
The Nav., Bluetooth,

easy to handle.
The quality and interior workmanship has improved!!!!
