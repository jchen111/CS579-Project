I bought a new Traverse last month and I really like car, except for the headrest.
The headrest sticks out so far, it gives me a pain the neck.
There is no way to turn it around, or have it go far enough back to not cause the problem.
So when you test the drive, be aware of this and make sure you fit into the seat as it is designed.
