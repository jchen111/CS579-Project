The roof rack cross bars can only be installed 27 Inches apart!!!!! There is no other place to install the Toyota factory cross bar for greater spacing. There are no other aftermarket roof racks(Yakima, Thule, etc) that will fit on the roof because of the decorative chrome coated plastic roof rails. 

The Yakima roof rack(Q-Tower) can only be installed if there are no decorative chrome coated plastic roof rails. You could remove the decorative roof rails. LOL.

Toyota claims to have asked the public for input on the design. There is also the claim who uses the rack anyway.

The roof rack is fixed 27 inches apart only. The racks cannot be moved beyond 27 inches for a larger separation. 

I have not been able to find an after market roof rack that will fit on the roof for a greater separation.

Toyota claims to have researched this problem by asking people. Toyota also said no one uses the rack anyway. LOL.

If you need to carry bikes, surfboards, kayaks, canoes, etc. you will have to carry them with racks that are only 27 inches apart. Would that 27" separation be safe? Toyota must think so in their design. Good luck!

I bough a toyota Highlander xle awd 2014, and i have a issue 2 weeks after my purchase. When i step on the break, and release it, i hear a strange noise from behind. I send it to my Toyota dealer, and they said that all Toyota on the lot have that problem. It will be my last Toyota made in the Us. Do not buy Toyota people........

Accelerates fast (3.5 L engine) and smoothly because it has 6 speeds.
I would guess 0-60 time of 7.1 like 2013 model.

- Double wishbone rear suspension for better handling and wider 3rd row.
We hardly felt speed bumps.
- Shelf for cellphone, Bluetooth, hands-free
- BIG 8inch GPS TOUCHSCREEN and backup camera and apps like Accuweather, traffic. and computer is snappy
- side mirrors have turn light blinkers

the roofline.
Integrated rear spoiler.
