Probably one of the best SUV's out there right now. I bought my wife a bare bones SXT with upgraded 8.4 touchscreen and heated seats/steering wheel. She loves it and won't let me drive everywhere anymore. Comes nicely loaded and doesn't feel cheap even in the base SXT trim. If fact you have to hunt for any options it is missing. No one can tell it isn't a Citadel model. The 3.6 has the perfect balance of power and economy. Honestly I don't think the hemi is needed unless you plan on towing with it. It has a useable 3rd row. It comes down the same assembly line as the Jeep Grand Cherokee that has won all the best quality build awards. Also, it is on the Consumer Reports Recommended list.
