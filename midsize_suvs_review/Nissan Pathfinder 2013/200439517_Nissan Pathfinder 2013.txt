 2013 Pathfinder was rear ended with damage to the driver side rear quarter panel. Pathfinder has been at the Nissan body shop for six weeks waiting on the quarter panel. The insurance company has ok'ed ( without my knowledge) the shop to repair the damaged sheet metal rather than continuing to wait on the rear quarter panel. When contacted Nissan consumer affairs on assistance with rental car reinbursment and or possible making a payment due to the lack of repair parts. I was told the part was on national backorder. no assistance on the rental nor the payment. 

Nissan customer service has slipped from what it used to be as I have owned 8 other Nissans. This will be my last one
!!!!!

At least until the transmission issues with stuttering and surging are sorted out, avoid this one. The storage spaces are poorly thought out, can't get the glove compartment open if there's a passenger in the front. The center console screen is confusing and low quality. No Bluetooth music connectivity unless you spring for navigation, and the Bluetooth phone is really noisy.

After taking the SUV home I was over joyed . After about 300 miles I noticed a a shutter when the gas pad was applied lightly and it disappeared as the suv 's speed reached about 35 mph..My dealer Sutherlin Nissan was wonderful..They put a new converter as per the mother company"s policy and on the way home about 10 miles, the problem was still there.. I called them and they then took it to the next step and ordered a new tranny. Since then two long trips and 7000 miles on the Suv and now after owning this Suv for three mths,,I give it 4 1/2 stars overall..Sutherlin Nissan of fort myers fla gets 5 stars and they also give a lifetime warranty at no add.charge on the drivetrain. Very nice SUV.

Purchased on 12 Aug 2013.
Took it on a trip last week (30 Oct t0 2 Nov).
Experienced power surges when stopped, rpm jumped from 500 to 1000 .
Had to keep foot on brake.
Vehicle shuddered, once to the point that the whole vehicle shook.
Took it to dealer today, 4 Nov, they called and told me that the transmission had to be replaced.
The vehicle is 2 1/2 months old and has 2300 miles.
They also
told me that it was Nissan's policy to replace transmissions with remanufactured transmissions.
Immediately called Nissan customer Care, told them this was not acceptable.
Was told that my complaint would be expedited and that someone form Nissan HQ would call me.
Waiting for more info now.

New CVT Transmission has shuttering problem that Nissan doesnt have a fix for. they have tried replacing Torque converter with limited success. this Transmission is flawed, we paid $38K for a vehicle that cannot be fixed. NO more Nissans ever!

I had been looking at replacing my Subaru tribeca. I looked at the explorer, acadia, santa fe. and highlander. The explorer's interior felt cheap compared to the acadia and pathfinder and it was not as quiet also. The santa fe was a decent vehicle but did not really like it. The toyota's interior felt patched together....two information screens, and second row seats seemed to be a pain to configure. It really came down to the Acadia SLT and the Pathfinder SL. I could have bought either but the pathfinder was thousands less than the GMC.
So far I have put on about 2200 miles in two months. The ride is smooth and quiet. Interior is very upscale.

Purchased in April, the car has been to the dealership
3 times for repairs (over 30 days in the shop and counting, it is there now).
First visit was for a misaligned hood and pax airbag issue.
Second was for same Pax airbag issue and CVT, currently in for a new transmission due to cvt issues (stuttering between 15 and 20 mph).
We are invoking our state's lemon law to have Nissan buy back, we will see how that goes.
Great looking car, quality is the worse I have ever seen in my 30 years of purchasing vehicles.

Purchase the 2013 pathfinder march 2013.
At about 160 miles the shaking, shuttering with the cvt started and the car was losing power at 1200-1500 rpms during acceleration.. The dealer found no prob.
I was almost t-boned twice with my family in vehicle and so after 2 more trips to dealer and no fix I got nissan corporate involved.
Needless to say they were no help. They acknowledged that they had received numerous consumer complaints but no solution. I requested that they replace my vehicle for another new pathfinder and a week later they refused with no explanation. The dealer eventually replaced it for me but have same cvt prob with new one. Don't buy this SUV too many prob..shame niss!

I would not recommend the 2013 Nissan Pathfinder.
Wait until they get all the bugs out. I started having problems with the transmission a few days after buying the Pathfinder.
Took it back in to the dealer but they could not find anything wrong with it.
A month or so later I get a recall notice about the transmission.
Went in for the "fix"...and it began acting up on the way home, which means the"fix" did not work.
I live 1.5 hours from the dealership and I am taking it in for the third time after the recall "fix".
Dealership never can find anything wrong with it, but they only drive it around the block...no wonder. Very, very disappointed and now stuck with it.

So far I am enjoying my first SUV. Very good ride, interior and space for my needs.
It's actually a little more space than I really need.
Everything is easily accessible.
The gas mileage is very good.
I've had it three months and no problems to date.
I bought the SL Premium edition.
I read a few complaints here.
Unfortunately, every vehicle will have some glitches -- no matter what the make.
There's no perfect car.
I've owned Hondas, Pontiacs, Chryslers, Mitsubishis and Nissans and there wasn't a perfect one in the bunch.
