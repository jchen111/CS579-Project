With 2 kids now and carpooling I needed something with a third row. I love it because it's not totally huge but the inside (even the third row) is very roomy. I especially like the second row folds forward even with car seat in it.
We got the car in Dec of 2012. We got one of the first ones in our state and When we got there they were still cleaning it up and saw them taking stickers off some of the interior that said Infiniti on them.
Yes this platinum addition has the interior of a luxury car/SUV . Now on performance.
The car drives great!!!! I have had the car a year and a half and have over 10000.
I have had zero issues except for the recall on airbag and brakes.

My 2013 Nissan pathfinder has had transmission problems for months and I have repeatedly given Nissan the opportunity to fix it and have had the transmission replaced once.
Yesterday it stalled in the middle of an intersection with traffic coming in both directions and my two children in the car.
 I will not drive this car again.
I paid $43,000 for a car I am afraid to drive or put my children in.
Nissan needs to correct these problems and stop putting people at risk.

I purchased my 2013 Pathfinder in Nov of 2012, it began having the "shudder" fairly shortly after but I didn't acknowledge it for a while.
As it continued to worsen, I brought it to the dealers attention. I was told they were aware but did not have a fix for it.
I continued to mention it every time I brought the car in for service.
I was finally told to call Nissan which is a joke.
They sent me back to the dealer who has told me that for their protection they must be very careful with how they handle it. What about the $45,000 I spent.
Where is my protection?
I am considering hiring a lawyer....

I love my 2013 Pathfinder with the exception of the sputtering every so often.
I have been told that there is no fix and Nissan is working on one; so therefore there is no recall as of now.
It feels as though it will cut off when it does this.
I have been told that no Pathfinder with this problem has cut off so far.

I bought platinum premium pkg one week ago I was going to buy infiniti JX but I compere both of this car and has same feature and lot cheaper then infiniti JX and I save almost $6000 dollar I love the car. I bought this car at 640nissan Knoxville tn which provides 100K miles powertrain Warranty. Salesman were so trained and well-mannered not like other dealers who just want to push you even u don?t even like, chris miller was my salesman one of the best and educated regarding the car. I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anybody who is looking for a SUV better then Toyota Highlander.

For those complaining about the lack of multi disc changer in the Platinum edition...
It replaces the cd changer with a dvd player which means that you can watch dvd's on the main screen when in park.
You also can put all of your music from your computer onto a dvd and listen to 100 times the music of a regular audio cd.
My wife decided to get a 16gb usb drive ($10) to put all of her music onto and plugs into the port in console.
On top of that you can stream bluetooth audio.

We traded in a Honda Pilot and are very impressed with the improvement in handling, interior quality and gas mileage.

We purchased a platinum premium about a week ago...After going with the intentions of buying the Infiniti JX we decided to drive the Pathfinder and actually like the drive and ride of it better.
On top of that it saved us $10,000 compared to the JX, now we realize there are some options you cant get on the Pathfinder that the JX has but we could not justify the $10k difference...also its avg 22 mpg around town on the first tank!!!
