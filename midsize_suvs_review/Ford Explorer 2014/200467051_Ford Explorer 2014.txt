I recently traded a 2007 exployer sport trac for 2014 exployer. The is a major differents in the ride quialty from the 07 to the 14 . Gas milage has been very impressive on the highway my best so far has been 26.5
at a 77mph. cruise with 3 people & the air on. City has been pretty good at about 21. It rides very smooth & there is no problem when you need power to pass. I am very happy so far with my exployer.
