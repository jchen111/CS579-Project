We like our Limited Explorer quite a bit. Good daily driver and good on trips. I would prefer the larger Expedition but the Explorer is all we need.
Engine has to struggle to perform but it suffices.
I imagine the larger ecoboost performs better but it only comes in Sport model.
We paid just over $43k for MSRP of $50k - so good value for what it is.
It rides well and has lots of features - but there are downsides as well.
