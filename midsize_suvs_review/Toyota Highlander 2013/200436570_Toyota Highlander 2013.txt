I bought my highlander in october of 2013 as brand new. After driven 6kmiles,
in May of 2014, R/R struts got busted, leaking and noise. I only have two kids, and never loaded it yet with more than 5 people yet until today. So why the hell the struts failed? On 6k miles? Really? Well, I don't know why. It's on the record, i got this car at oak lawn toyota of oak lawn illinois. Repairs were done in oak lawn toyota under warranty. I'm giving it another chance coz I still do trust toyota, I guess I just got unlucky with that strut as a factory defect. It happens, but I'm really bit
worried. What if my warranty expires? Well i still do have two years? Crossing my fingers.......

Traded in my prius after I got into an accident and decided to go bigger, and after much research: tada : highlander. It was the perfect car that was not too big, and not too small. And with the addition of the plus package, perfect for the budget. Out here in CA, you can pretty much get this for about 30k or so before TTL. I think it's a pretty good bargain comparing the other choices out there. Mind you, the RX 350 has no 3rd row. People say it is for kids, but for short trips, it's definitely ok. For long trips, still possible, but you'd probably need to do some rotation. Plenty of cargo room. Very quiet ride. V6 is thirsty for gas, but very powerful for moving around on highway.

We purchased our Highlander 5 weeks ago and have 2200 miles logged. The comfort and practically of the interior is superb. It drives very well, quiet cabin, and we love the bluetooth and rear view camera. The V-6 has plently of power and average 24-26 mpg on the hwy. In mixed driving 22 mpg. There is also plenty of storage.
