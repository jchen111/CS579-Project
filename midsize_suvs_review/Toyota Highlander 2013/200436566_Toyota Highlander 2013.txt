Toyota has been a part of my life for 20 yrs. I love the reliability and in recent years, the stereo system are far better than other makes. The suspension and light weight power are impressive over my previous 4runners. Enjoy the room and captain seats in the rear. I saw reviews on the navigation, etc. Mine work just fine but there is a lot of stuff that requires 2 manuals for multiple options.
This is a fun vehicle to drive I can feel the engine power over heavier older SUV's I have owned. The sound system is better than ever and Toyota has higher quality systems in general. The only thing I don't like is how Toyota does not have paint durability like older models.

We bought our 2013 SE 4WD in January '14 to replace our '11 Murano as we had bought an Escape 17B trailer. It weighs appx. 2600 lbs. loaded, and the Murano wasn't really built for it.
All SE's have the tow package included- a must for anyone towing regularly to properly cool engine & trans oil. Ours also came with hitch.

The experience in towing is night and day. On paper both vehicles are somewhat similar, however with the 4WD (AWD really), and its extra curb weight. It pulls our trailer easily. Also, the Murano has a CVT trans, and am not sure about the durability of it with significant towing.

Took my new Highlander (with 2300 miles on it) on vacation to Hilton Head Island -
after arrival, started hearing a roaring noise from left rear tire area - stopped by Toyota dealership and they discovered the wheel bearing needed to be replaced.
Had to delay my scheduled return home for a couple of days, thus putting me into the midst of a tropical storm.
Very inconvenient and frightening.
After all the research I conducted before purchasing a new car, I was shocked that I became stranded while on vacation in my brand new car.
Needless to say, I feel uncomfortable about driving this car for a long distance again.
