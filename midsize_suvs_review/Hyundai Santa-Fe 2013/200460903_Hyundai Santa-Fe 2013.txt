I bought the Santa Fe in April of 2013.  I put a lot of miles on my vehicle with highway travel back and forth to work and driving my child to her activities.  Currently my vehicle has 40,000 in October of 2014.  I really enjoyed the vehicle at first, until the funny clunking sound started in the front end while starting off from a complete stop.  After my Hyundai ceritifed service department at Bob Brady Dodge proceded to tell me nothing was wrong with my vehicle and that they had driven it 10 miles, although the odometer had the same mileage as when it was dropped off.  When the service guy rode with me he did confirm it didn't sound right, although they convinced me it was just the AWD.
