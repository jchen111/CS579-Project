I literally test drove every mid-size SUV imaginable in my quest to buy my next vehicle. Coming from a Honda CR-V, I needed more interior space to cart around my large friends (All are well above 6ft tall) and my two large dogs, along with their crates. The Santa Fe was an option I was unwilling to consider, until I drove one. The ride is beautiful, and comfort mode steering helps tremendously. My small frame is a bit overwhelmed by the large seats, but the power seats and lumbar support make it more than comfortable. The options I have: heated steering wheel, front and rear seats, back up cam, navigation, Bluelink and leather seats for less money than a mid range Honda. #hyundaifamily

The new Santa Fe 7 passenger was everything and more. We loved the vehicle that we purchased in April. It provided a great car and towing capacity which suited our families needs. I was in heaven until Nov. with less than 6000 miles.

I am currently in discussions with Hyundai and the BBB since the car is considered a lemon. End of Oct my vehicles fuel injector went out. It has been in the shop for over 30 days because it had to brought in another 2 more times for seals on the fuel injection system that failed. Currently there is no repair date because the parts need to come from Korea and are on back order for a new rail for the fuel injection system. The car is not drivable now.

I traded in a 2010 Santa Fe Limited FWD which was fully loaded for the 2013 GLS AWD.
The car is a serious upgrade in every way.
The external styling is much improved.
 The internal styling is also lovely, with much improved materials, backup camera and navigation system.
 The biggest improvement is in the overall ride and quietness.
The previous model was quite noisy and you felt every imperfection in the road.
This model is as quiet as a luxury sedan and goes over bumps very smoothly.
Also, the previous model exhibited serious understeer when accelerating.
This one does not, probably due to the AWD.
So far, I'm getting better than advertised gas mileage.

I traded my 2002 GLS (that I purchased new and absolutely loved) for this new 7 passenger model. Although the interior and exterior are great there are a fewl things I'm not sure i can live with. 1. The gas petal is mounted from the bottom not the top as in a normal car and
I have yet to find a comfortable position. I think it will be impossible not to use the cruise control on a long trip.
2. Steering is terrible and floats all over the road (doesn't matter what mode). Just doesn't feel tight.
3. The drivers seat adjustment does not allow the bottom of the seat to be raised in the back. 4. The passenger seat cannot be raised and it feels like you are sitting in a hole.

I traded in my 2010 Santa Fe Limited for a 2013 GLS with AWD.
 I would have like to have gone for the
Limited but I wanted 7 seats, and not 6.


So far, I have to say that for the most part, the vehicle is much improved.
The exterior is much more handsome, although you lose a little rear visibility.
The interior is vastly improved, with much more comfortable seats, higher material quality, and hugely improved instrumentation and controls.


Most noticeable is the improved quietness of the car, and the vastly improved ride quality.
In the older version, you would feel a big jolt over minor potholes.
The new one adsorbs the impact so that they are barely perceptible.
