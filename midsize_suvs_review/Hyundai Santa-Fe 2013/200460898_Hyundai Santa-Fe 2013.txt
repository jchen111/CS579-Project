Shopped 6 months before deciding on the Santa Fe (LWB). Looked at the Flex, Traverse, Acadia, Pilot and Highlander, and dollar for dollar the Santa Fe could not be beat. I test drove it on two separate occasions and fell in love with it. Very compliant ride over our terrible city streets, the interior is nice and quiet and even in heavy traffic my son sleeps soundly in the back. Plenty of options and room for everyone and everything we need to haul around, plenty of power in the V6 and I'm getting 18.5 mpg city, which is the same as I got in my V6 Camry that I traded in. Very happy with my purchase thus far.

Just purchased 2WD V6 with Navi and 3 rows of seats.
Drove from LV to LA, 23.7mpg with ave speed of 67mph.
Very comfortable, great vision and no
real blind spots.
You still need to turn your head and look!
A/C worked great as temp in LV and desert 109F.
Great power, no problems going up any of the grades and able to easily pass.
Can't tell the difference between 70-90mph, so you have to pay attention.
Takes a while to learn the Navi system and it's not as good as the Honda Crosstour to learn or use (few more steps and a more difficult menu system).
Handles very car like and has a compliant (not mushy) suspension. Handles the Pasadena fwy curves easily at >60mph with some body lean
