The 2013 Santa Fe Sport 2.0T AWD is a good all round suv and does attain a fair gas mileage if driven below 70 with the econo engaged. I have one concern regarding the engine as it has happened several times where it feels like the engine has stalled and when you try to engage the gas pedal the engine does not respond. It is quite disconcerting when you are trying to cross traffic when making left hand turns and there is no acceleration. If you wait one or two seconds or feather the gas it will seem to engage the fuel system and you are good to go. It has also done this on the interstates when you are drivng without cruise and the gas pedal just goes dead.

Was drawn by the new design, & stopped by dealership for test drive!
Wow, my wife and I love this vehicle!
 Great power from the turbo, the features and extras make us not want to get out!
 I had the chance to drive on a very windy day on a major highway @ 70mph.
18 wheelers swaying, leaves blowing, but the Santa Fe was smooth and stable.
Handles nice,
braking is smooth, not spongy, and cockpit is stylish, and not cheap looking.
 Leather heated seats w/ 3 temps, Bluetooth & bluelink awesome, cup holder in nice position,
an eyeglass compartment that actually holds my sunglasses - big plus! Gas mileage on Eco, I was able to hit 26.


Nothing but love for this ride

This is my first Hyundai.
After driving Fords for 30 years, this is definitely something different.
The car has 10,000 miles on it, with 2,000 in the last week.
It was driven both on interstates and in the mountains and the performance was good in both locations.
The mileage could be better, averaged 27 on the road and 24 in town.
The interior is comfortable and well thought out.
With snow in the mountains the heated seats were a welcome addition.
Overall a great car for two people with room for two more.

I purchased the Santa Fe at Palm springs Hyundai and have two problems. The drivers seat was loose and when you drive away from a stop you felt as if you were going to tip backwards. It was resolved with a quick repair at the local dealership. The other problem is that the gas pedal does not work all the time. You get a dead feeling and there is no power when you go to pull away from an intersection or what ever. It is extremely discomforting when you are trying to cross a lane of traffic and the car does not respond to pressing on teh gas pedal. It seems to be happening more often than it first did. Anyone else have this problem.

I purchased a 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe (2.0 T AWD) in March of 2013.
I havenÂt owned a Hyundai since 1988 and assumed the brand had improved.
While in comparison to the 1988 Excel I owed, quality has made leaps and bounds, but this vehicle still falls short.
The steering is erratic no matter what steering mode is chosen.
Due to this, control of the vehicle, especially at high speeds, is a challenge.
On roads with bumps, the vehicle seems to jump when hitting one.
If turning a corner and a bump is hit, hold on tightÂyou may lose control of the vehicle.
This is a safety concern experienced by many other 2013 Santa Fe owners and to date Hyundai corporate hasnÂt addressed the issue.

Bought a Juniper Green with Beige AWD 2.0T at the end of July. Loaded with everything, save for remote start. This CUV replaces my old 07 SF LTD. This new version is sportier, better looking, tighter, and a lot more fun to drive. The interior is great, so much more comfortable than my 07. Everything is within reach and very easy to use. The Nav/Radio/Back up camera is really nice. The 12 speaker surround sound is concert hall quality. The 2.0 Turbo is a stout little workhorse that has plenty of zip. there's nothing i don't like about my new Santa Fe.

I bought a fully loaded Santa Fe Sport a few months ago and I am very pleased with my purchase.Not only does this vehicle have a very comfortable and quiet ride but it is also a lot of fun to drive,especially with the 2.0 turbo engine, it feels as quick as any 6 cylinder but with better mpg.Some owners have complained about the steering in the new Sport,I will say that it does have a different feel to it but nothing that you can't get use to after being behind the wheel for a short time,Hyundai like other car makers is now putting electric power steering in its vehicles so you will read this in other car reviews as well,but I will say that it can turn on a dime,and great for making U-turns.

let me start by saying that i've previously owned four straight Audis, the last of which felt pretty boring to me, so it was time for a change. after test driving numerous vehicles (including BMW, Porsche) i took a spin in the sante fe 2.0T AWD, and was frankly shocked at how nice it was. i've purchased one and i couldn't be happier -- it's quiet, refined, peppy, smooth, handles well and is actually fun to drive. very nice set of features, and of course an outstanding warranty. and all this for half (or more) of what i would have paid for a German counterpart. unless you feel obligated to impress your neighbors with an expensive nameplate you owe it to yourself to take one for a test drive.

I got the Santa Fe with a trade-in, and the total cost was about 29K (before trade) with the warranty/gap/taxes etc. Although I did not get a package like the sunroof, leather interior, rear view camera, gps, etc., I think the base model is still a great deal for the money I spent. I need an awd due to my location, and this vehicle is the best option out there for this price. I also checked options like Ford, Nissan, Mazda and Honda, and I would have to spend an extra 5-10K just to get the same level of comfort/performance from the other brands.

We purchased 2 SFS in November.
Mine is the 2.0T and the other is the 2.4.
Both are exceptional CUV's.
The AWD has been wonderful in the snow too.
The 2.4 get 22 in the city and the 2.0T has been getting 21.
Highway for the 2.0T averages stays between 26-28.
For an AWD CUV I am happy with the MPG.
I've had experience with the 2.0T in my 2011 Optima.
Though the HP is less in the SFS I am more than pleased with the power.
The only issues we have had is trying to decide which one to take!!
Absolutely love the purchases we made.
