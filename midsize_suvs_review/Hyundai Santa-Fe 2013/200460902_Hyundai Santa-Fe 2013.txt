Bought this version in August of 2013.
The dealer had put almost 500 miles on it when I bought it.
No problems until it rained hard.
There is a loud rain noise near the rear on the driver's side.
Dealer says they can't figure it out, although it persists.
A similar noise has started when the wind is blowing hard.
About two months ago I noted that the leather on the driver's side seat
is wearing
thin on the edge.
Don't know if this is unique to the saddle leather or not. Awaiting dealer comments. Rides well, otherwise very quiet, good pick up, great sound system with the upgrade and navigation.
Navigation maps are already out of date for where I live and it costs $250 to upgrade.
