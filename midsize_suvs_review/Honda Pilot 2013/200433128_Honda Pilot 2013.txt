..and that's saying a lot - this is my 9th vehicle, 4th Honda, and 2nd Honda Pilot. Had my first Pilot ('05 model) for 7 years. Just bought a 2014 EX 4WD. There is NO engine vibration when in the VCM (aka, ECO) mode. Honda has reduced exterior noise considerably from my first Pilot - this one has a very quiet interior. Very smooth engine and transmission - typical Honda. Fantastic amount of interior space and cargo room. Great looking SUV, unlike many of the so-called modern SUVs that look like ugly, glorified station wagons. I love everything about the Pilot. The USB port and bluetooth hands-free link are much appreciated. Thanks Honda!!!

Honda pilot is a great car, roome and comfortable.
To prevent engine vibrations in "eco" mode, which is only happens in cold weather,
use premium fuel in winter and mid grade or regular in summer.
Fill out a full tank with premium fuel and drive 75 mph on Highway with D3 on for about 20 miles and it's gone. Pilot is much beter choise that his rival's Pathfinder and Grand Cherokee, because they aretrue lemon cars with transmission problem's.

With the birth of our son we had to upgrade and get a family vehicle. I had Honda's before but I wanted a change to something different. Looked at the CX-9 and we liked it a lot, too bad Mazda has crummy leasing programs. I wanted no part of an unsafe boring looking Highlander and all the problems Toyota has nowadays. JGC was close but American reliability is no way close to the Japanese lets be real. The Pilot is safe. That is all that matters right now to me for our son, Safety. Cargo area is great, it really does swallow up stuff. Ride is comfortable and gas mileage is adequate it is a 4X4. People who buy cars who worry about gas mileage go hug a tree and get a hybrid. Pilot=Family Safe.
