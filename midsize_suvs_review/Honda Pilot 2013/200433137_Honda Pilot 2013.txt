I traded a CRV for this 2013 Honda Pilot 4WD Touring. The Pilot came home and immediately had a moonroof leak that soaked the interior. The drain tubes were disconnected from the factory. That should have been a sign. The MPG never made it to 25 on the highway, and averages
of 15-17 were common in mixed driving over 7000 miles, even with minimal passengers. The VCM was horrible. Sometimes it felt like a bad torque converter, other times it stumbled on flat ground regularly while activating/deactivating cylinders. The only way to tolerate driving it is to drive it in D3, which shouldn't be necessary on a 40K vehicle. We traded back into a Camry SE V6. Honda has VCM troubles.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got my 13 Honda Pilot 5 months ago, 17k miles, at about 10k the known and accepted (By Honda ) Shudder Vibration in the VCM started, Since I drive so much it is not a characteristic I can accept, it shudders and vibrates at about 1500-2200 rpm.
I will write to Honda but don't expect anything back since
the dealership is aware, so should be HONDA. If you don't care about long trips being disgustingly frustrating, buy it, if you want a reasonable
ride ,stay away until Honda get its right. ALSO Bluetooth Microphone is from the dark ages ( Toyota fixed theirs years ago) it doesn't work well with cell phone. I think I trade for a
better ride,but it will hurt because may features are nice

I have bought 4 Honda's in my lifetime, including the 2013 Pilot touring 4wd.
Only some minor issues thus far, but for sure the dealerships and Honda corporate are always trying to downplay the problems or consider them "normal". Honda has lost me for life.
My other complaints are related to the ergonomics of the vehicle. 
1) Can't load MP3 or WMA files on the hard drive. CD songs only. 
2) Navigation doesn't show as much info as even a $80 GPS and you have to pay $150 for map updates.
3) No always on compass. The only compass is the navigation and it only points toward the north. Doesn't show you what direction you are heading.
4)Climate controls are ridiculous and hard to find/use.

Okay, I bought this car for my wife and now I want one.
Drove everything in this category, CX9, Stretch and non stretch Sante Fe, GM moon rovers, explorer.
Big fan of explorer looks and big Ford fan in general, but it drove (actually rented) too big and sadden to say, My Touch is out of touch.
This pilot was very well equipped and drives fantastic and the Consumer Report parking lot handling quips are BS - it handles them with no problem.
Everything inside is just right.
But most of all the wife "loves" her pilot and for me that is all that matters.
 BTW those that don't like the boxy look try a few add-ons (eg.visors) , they sweeten the look. You don't drive the look.
Great product!!

Go on a long test drive before buying this vehicle and tell the salesman not to talk so you can listen and feel without distraction.
This vehicle has a pronounced vibration in echo mode which can be felt and heard.
My vehicle also developed a very suttle ringing and I only have a few thousand miles on it.
The dealer says it is just part of the vehicle design and that their computers say nothing is wrong.
So I'm SOL.
I loved my first Honda Pilot but I won't buy another Honda product after this experience.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looked at several different SUVs including the Volvo XC90. The Volvo XC90's ride was too rigid and the design was very outdated. Also, not a lot of space. Saw the Honda Pilot at a local auto show and fell in love. Had all of the features you could ask for. Not to mention the Honda's reputation of being very reliable. The Pilot does not feel like a large SUV when driving, but the cabin space is huge! Plenty of room for 8 adults with plenty of storage. Took it on a long distance trip that was about 7 hours and was completely satisfied with the comfort and drive. Love the navigation, rear entertainment system, backup camera and hands free bluetooth. Overall a great vehicle.

Traded my 2011 2wd touring for a 2013 4wd.
Just paying $25/month more on 36 month lease.
(Now its $525/mo) I like the 4wd model much better.
2wd tends to spin front wheels on acceleration and pulls hard to right from stop.
Like the 4wd much better, plus it can tow 2x more.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I love about this vehicle (2010), is how it works so damned good in the real world. As mentioned in the article, its boxy shape means large items go in without any worries, unlike the RX330 we traded-up from and all of its slopes. It's third row accommodates even my large body (5-10, 235lbs), and 8 people can travel in comfort.

The fuel mileage is excellent too- nearly showing 25mpg on a week-long trip a couple years ago, and needing only about 2 tanks of gas to travel from TN to MS and then AL, and back, with a lot of driving in between (and on regular fuel), really impressed me.

No, it doesn't have Suburban-class towing, but I don't need that. And it's not a large vehicle!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We trade our '08 Ex-L in on a '13 Touring model. So far, we love it. It's very smooth and comfortable on the road. We've not experienced any of the "chugging" sensation when in cruise mode, as others described on the '12's. And I really don't understand why people complain about the Pilot's acceleration - it's MORE than adequate for soccer moms. I have a 330 HP BMW sports car, and I can tell you I am VERY pleased with the acceleration of the Pilot. Only drawback so far has been the navigation system. It's ok once you get used to it, but it's not real intuitive. It would also be nice to have remote start (not on a $40k car?!), but that's a bit nit-picky. Overall, another solid Pilot.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my second Honda Pilot. Honda is very well known for producing reliable vehicles. This Pilot is no exception. Very roomy from inside. Smooth drive on highways. Acceleration is sluggish. You also feel like driving a truck rather than an SUV. I used to own a Murano before my new pilot, which was more fun to drive. I like the boxy exterior which makes it more unique than current SUVs in the market today. Seats are comfortable. Excellent sound for the Touring although does not carry a brand sound system like the majority of other SUVs. I am getting about 24 MPG on highways but about 14 to 15 MPG in the city.
