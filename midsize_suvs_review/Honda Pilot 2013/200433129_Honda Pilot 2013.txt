We have a 2011 Pilot EX-L and it has been great so great in fact that I purchased a second one.
If your looking for a car ride or a station wagon SUV than this will not be your car.
However, it excels at what it does and that is being a SUV that can carry anything and everyone.
We comfortably fit all three of our kids in the middle row (2 car seats (3&4 and 11 yo).
It is not the quietest SUV but that is what the radio is for ;-).
The reliability and safety is awesome.
Also, the value is hard to beat - I looked at all the competitors but the American SUV's just cost to much to get the same features that we wanted (leather & sunroof).
Didn't like the lower seat height of the CX-9
