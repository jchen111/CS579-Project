My wife had this vehicle for a month.
While driving, when the engine went into ECO mode there would be a stutter and hesitation.
The entire floor would vibrate.
I researched this problem and it seemed that a lot of people were having the same issue without a fix.
I traded the vehicle in instead of dealing with this.
Bought a highlander and it runs much better.

Well....don't look any further.
If you have not owned a Honda (my 5th), you don't know what I mean.
Honda reliability, over all comfort, safety, service, price, ( did I mention reliability & safety) and the best dealers around...it's a no-brainer!
I get a soild 22mpg all the time and get a 25mpg on cruise, level ground, at 65mph.
Beat that anywhere.
You are also riding in the safest vehicle make on the market!
We live were it snows... no worries it performs great!
The 8 passenger capacity will haul the gang in style, without leaving that "one" behind.
Just go and drive the Pilot you will come home with it!
Financing has always beat the others hands down.
Go see for yourself!!

After owning 5 Hondas with no problems the time came to pull the trigger on our biggest purchase to date..a new 2013 Pilot EX-L 4x4, to accommodate our 3rd child.

We purchased our pilot in September of 2012. I immediately noticed a bad vibration in Eco and have taken it to Honda 2 times now. I have also had a problem with the brake pedal being squishy. Honda won't do anything about the vibration, and they bled the brakes claiming there was nothing wrong with them.
The dealership is also stating that Honda says the vibration is normal in my make and model..WHAT!!..NORMAL!!!!
This is a $37,000 vehicle. Honda I'm opting out of the class action suit and suing.
I suggest others do the same.

I would not have bought my Pilot if I had known that there was a "normal vibration" when cruising in ECO mode.
Mine is very noticable at 1500 RPM and even according to technician, it shouldn't be there.
My car has 5K miles on it.
I would have spent my $38K on a different vehicle if I had known this.
If you are considering buying a Pilot, test drive it thoroughly at 1500 RPMs!!!

This is the second Pilot I have purchased.
This is the best vehicle I have owned.
It is reliable, safe, great in the snow and multifunctional.

Love the pilot for the interior space, real SUV look, solid feel while driving on freeways. 
Amazing interior space. Fits what ever you wanted to haul.
The reality is, there is no competitor with ability to fit your family or things like the Pilot.
We tried everything, and if you want third row to fit three people, there is really nothing out there that has that room for legs (armada, sequoia, all horrible).

This being my second new Honda Pilot in six years I would have to say I'm somewhat disappointed. Even though the 2013 Pilot has been totally redesigned from my previous 2008 Pilot, I've found serious flaws with the engine and transmission. The 2008 Pilot never had any noticeable "spark knock" whereas the 2013 definitely does. Also, there is a distinct vibration while in ECO mode when traveling on relatively flat roadways when applying light fuel pedal pressure. Lastly, the molding over the rear door is noticeable uneven. It appears (with the exception of the molding) these are things I will have to live with as the Dealership says they are natural characteristics of the vehicle.....
