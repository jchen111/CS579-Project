We purchased the LX. This is my first actual "new" vehicle purchase so it could be that I'm just overly excited about things that the rest of the world who have actually purchased new cars before consider normal, but it seems to me that the base model is actually pretty well loaded. So much so that I could not justify spending the extra money on another trim. It drives smooth, has plenty of room even in the back seat, suprisingly and while it would be nice to have the navigation and entertainment system, considering the difference in price, I'm very happy with the features on the LX.

I purchase my 2013 Pilot LX having some regrets for not getting the 4wd model and a sun roof. I have since changed my mind. I like the spacious interior, solid ride and more than adequate pick up on the highway or when I need it.
The seat adjustment gives me a high ride and excellent visibility. Spacious cargo space with the seats down. I love my Pilot.
