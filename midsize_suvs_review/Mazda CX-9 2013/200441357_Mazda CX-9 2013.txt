I came from a 2009 Mazda CX 9 Sport AWD which I absolutely loved.  Not a single problem with the 09.  I knew that the '13 was almost identical to the previous model year 9's but with more technological safety features.  I had to have a rear view back up camera.  The Blind Side Monitoring system is wonderful.

Although the New Grand Touring (GT) came with 20 inch wheels, I didn't really feel a big difference in ride quality.  The wheels are stylish but not chrome.  As another reviewer stated, the sheetmetal is not as it was in previous years and easily prone to dings.  The newer model's glove box has no locking mechanism and the coin storage drawer is gone.

This car is fun to ride and very comfortable. Fuel consumption a little high. Worst by far are the Navigation System, voice recognition and the electronic interfaces, such as the Sirius radio and Bluetooth. Those do not seem to have even been Beta Tested, such a poor design that makes you wonder about the rest of the car. Sad part is that it it is just poor software, which needs an urgent upgrade.

My previous car was an '06
BMW 530xi. Needed to go to an SUV to haul grand kids and golf gear.
3 seats were a must, and I wanted a quiet and enjoyable driving experience, up to date technology and now that I am retired, a reasonable price.
 The Audi was too $$, BMW was too small and $$, Kia and Hyundai looked & felt cheap, Nissan had poor service record and Honda Pilot was ugly.
That left the Toyota Highlander LTD and the CX-9.
I took long test drives in both cars in various driving and weather conditions and the Mazda CX-9 was a no brainer.
Quieter, more responsive, stylish in and out with a cleaner looking dash and instruments.
Technology is more advanced and much easier to use.

I shopped around and looked at a number of reviews and test drove a number of vehicles before deciding on the CX-9 Grand Touring Tech to replace my '04 Highlander. 

Great vehicle for the price. The ride is very nice and although the 20's do make the ride a tad rougher (as reviewers have said), overall the ride is more than acceptable. Vehicle has good power, which is helpful as I live in a hilly area. Gas mileage is right at 18 in a mix of city and highway driving short distances each day

Finish is great, quiet, tech package is very good and easy to operate. Very happy with the car.

I just purchased my CX9 and let me tell you, I am loving it.
I did not want to get out of it after my first drive to work.
The interior is very comfortable and the small touches that Mazda has added are really nice.
For instance, there is a little well in the center console for your USB or charger cord to rest in, so that you can fully close the console.
The all weather mats were standard on my model and I love them too!

I drove others, such as Ford, GMC, Chevy, and never felt like I was LOVING driving them.
Once I saw the CX9 reviews, I thought I would try it, and am so glad I did.
This car is VERY fun to drive.
I am so ready for my first road trip in about 3 weeks!

I have about 500 miles on my 2013 CX9 AWD Grand Touring SUV. I wanted reliability, a good array of technical options, comfort, quite ride and seven seats. I looked over a variety of options - the GM suite of products (Enclave, Acadia, Traverse), Toyota Highlander, BMW X5 and Acura MDX. I added the CX9 to the list after seeing its consumer rated reliability index was a 92, higher than the Highlander. My decision came down to the Highlander and CX9. Did not trust the GM products, Acura MDX is too expensive, same with the X5. Compared to the Highlander Ltd,
the CX9 GT has a better middle seat, better technical options, a better ride, and is a much better value. Paid $37k out the door for min

CX-9 is a great car. Very good quality, great Value. Compare it to all 7 seaters- CX 9 is the best value.

I got my for $34,000 - Grand Touring
- best value on the market
I was very disappointed with Byers Mazda - Columbus Ohio - actually with their service department.

The outside mirror is shaking
a lot, so I went there to ask the to fix it. It's bean almost a 6 months and I have been given all kind of excuses not to fix it - very disappointed.
