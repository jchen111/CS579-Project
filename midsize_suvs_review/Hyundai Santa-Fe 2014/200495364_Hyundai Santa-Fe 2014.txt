On a follow up to my first review, I thought I would tell you about our recent road trip. My wife and I just completed a 4,000.8 mile trip up to Vancouver Island, BC and back to central Nebraska. Our Santa Fe performed flawlessly all the way. We drove 69 hours and 17 minutes. Beautiful scenery and a great auto. Never once did either of us get tired butt, not once did we have any issues with our Santa Fe. We spent 11 days out, 10 nights. We stopped in Billings, MT at the brand new dealer facility for a quick oil change. Super comfortable ride and drive all the way up and back. We averaged 24.6 MPG driving 3-7 MPH over posted limit, with quite a few miles logged with 80 MPH limit.

We searched for a replacement for our 2006 Toyota Sequoia, wanting to go down in size. We looked at Toyota first, not finding the Highlander very appealing to us and dealer selection was awful. We also looked at Buick, Ford, GM and Dodge. We were very surprised when we began comparing features, options, overall cost and warranties of all the above. We found the Hyundai to be the best overall value by wide margin. Love driving it and the features are great. We had to drive a long way to find the one we wanted but well worth it!
