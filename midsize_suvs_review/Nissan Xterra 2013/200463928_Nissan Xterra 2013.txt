A month after I bought an Xterra, I took it through the car wash and water came through the roof.
I took it in to get serviced and it ended up needing a major repair to the roof.
Nissan ended up offering to repurchase the vehicle per the terms of the CO lemon law.
They subtracted $945 for usage which I thought was a lot for 2 months of driving.
They also refused to refund a few items on the purchase agreement saying they were Ânon NissanÂ items.
The arbitrations woman, Denise C., claimed that Nissan and the dealership were different entities and was very rude and difficult throughout the process of me trying to recoup my money.
