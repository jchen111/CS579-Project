Had heard about the shuddering challenges, decided to purchase anyway - alas, at low miles it started to shudder, talked to my dealer and was told it was nothing ..... 

On a road trip to Canada it got to the point I was ready to return the vehicle once we got home. Called Nissan directly who directed me to the nearest dealer, who identified, addressed and fixed the problem within hours! Only have good things to say about them.

LOVE this car, it offers everything plus more! I researched the rest, then purchased the best! Ride, comfort, features OUTSTANDING.

Like many posters here, we're having serious issues with our Nissan Pathfinder transmission.
At low RPMs the entire car shakes.
We've had it in for service several times.
The issue has yet to be resolved.
There are less than 10K miles on the car.

I bought a 2014 Nissan Pathfinder Plat with Premium options and the vehicle had 9 miles on it. I drove the vehicle 50 miles to my home and the next morning there was an i-Key system error or similar.
A little later the check engine light came on. OBD code was P0850. I was told there was a fob programming but it turned out to be a shifter assembly part needed to be replaced. Needless to say, I had to bring the vehicle back to get it fixed. A couple of days later my wife was sitting in the passenger seat and I noticed the passenger airbag was off. Back to the dealer and I am told the seat was not calibrated. They fixed it, yesterday the issue with the airbag is back.

We were so excited to finally purchase our new Pathfinder.
Three days later it started sputtering.
We took it in to the dealer and they said it was the tourque converter, it took 2 weeks to get the part in.
When we got it back it was still doing the same thing.
We took it back in and they said it was the transmission.
They replaced the transmission with a "re-manufactured" part.
The dealership has been fantastic, but trying to get through to the executive Nissan office has been a nightmare.
We are really afraid of what is to come.
