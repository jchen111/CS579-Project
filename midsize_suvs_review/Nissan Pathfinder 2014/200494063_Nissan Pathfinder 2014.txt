I like how smooth the ride is in this car.
Also, compared to the 2012 Nissan Pathfinder I just traded in, this car is roomier inside.
I look forward to seeing the types of gas mileage savings I will be able to realize.
The 2012 Pathfinder was on a truck frame, but this is not and as a result, it is a sportier ride.
