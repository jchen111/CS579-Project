1. Affordability - Priced $10k to $20k under all other premium based Hybrid SUVs.
2. Luxurious - a very quiet and smooth ride. Leg and head room galore. Has everything even the heated and cooled leather seats front and heated seats back. 
3. Economical- Rated with an all around MPG of 26. First tank full of gas resulted in a city/highway drive mix 29 MPG.
4. Stylish- The Pathfinder just looks good! 
5. I am still amazed and surprised with all the appointments. I love this car! I am Happy! Happy!
