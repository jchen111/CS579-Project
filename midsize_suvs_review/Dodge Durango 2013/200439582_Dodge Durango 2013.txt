We had a 2011 Traverse LTZ that we were very happy with.
Liked the dependability and the room.
We were just looking for something nicer inside and with a little better ride and quieter.
We looked at Acura MDX (too small even the new one); New Traverse and Buick (mild refresh not too exciting); Infiniti QX60 (nice, a little slower and would have been $10k more than our fully loaded Durango Citadel.

From the first moment I drove the new 2014 Durango I was impressed by the handling; how solid and quiet it was; the ease of use of the Uconnect control system, and the performance.

We got a fully loaded Durango Citadel with with 5.7 L Hemi V8.
