This is the 4th R8 I have owned & it is by far the best . Dumped my 012 V10 R-Tronic
black optic edition for a 2014 V8 w/ S -Tronic . I love this car , smooth , powerful & sounds great . Comfortable for longer drives it is like they say.. an every day sports car .
Gets a lot of attention when I park it , people love the car .
