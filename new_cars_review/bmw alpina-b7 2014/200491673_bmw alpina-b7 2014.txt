great car with excellent pick up & effortless driving. comfortable and luxurious. 
however horrible set of oem tires. they are high performance summer tires totally unsuitable for cold city roads. they will burst on any pot hole contact. pot holes are almost standard in new york city after any snow storm. 
the tires are not available at any bmw dealer or tire shop and have to be ordered. bmw does not give a spare tire. 
beware! this makes the car extremely unreliable as there is no solution or help available
