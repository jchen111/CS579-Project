Test drove and got over 50 mpg consistently.
The car
has decent low end torque, so will pick up if you want it to.

The stereo system is fairly good quality.
Hatchback opens easily.
Nice storage.
Has spare tire.
The drive is very silky and smooth.
The best CVT I've driven.
The turning radius is incredible.
Will turn on the dime.
Handles beautifully around curves.
Suspension very sturdy with bumps.

Cons:
The major con is the incredible uncomfortable driving seat.

I compared several vehicles that met my requirements in a new vehicle and the Insight showed up. I had never heard of one before. Perhaps it is so unknown because Honda does not promote it. Few people are familiar with it but it meets my needs perfectly. I do not think most of the criticisms of it are fair. It is not noisy. It is comfortable. It runs smoothly and the gas mileage is terrific. The AC does turn off when the engine stops at lights, etc. but that is overcome by moving the car into Park which I do in our recent 100 degree weather. It is fun to drive. I am not a car nut. I expect my vehicles to get me where I am going as cheaply as possible. The Honda Insight LX does that.
