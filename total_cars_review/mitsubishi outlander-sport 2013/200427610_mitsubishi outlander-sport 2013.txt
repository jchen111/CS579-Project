Great for the budget minded who no longer need a van, but have teens at home, and kids in college to pay for. I have owned this for a year- looks & performs like I just drove it off the lot.

Phenomenal handling in torrential southern rain. Ice cold air.

Very comfortable for long distance college runs, even for my husband and college football player.

Kids argue over who is going to drive it- all phones ( iphone & android) hook up & function well with the FUSE system.

No one is taking this to school- it's mine :)

Where to start...rattles galore on a brand new car, idle that wants to destroy itself by jumping into the 3,000 rpm range after the first clutch engagement, that obnoxious chime that you can't disable when the temp hits 37 degrees.
Oh, and come to find out my "new" car was damaged in transit, repainted, and the damage was not disclosed.
When I called Mitsubishi about the body damage they wouldn't tell me how much they paid the dealer to fix the damage or sanction the dealer for non-disclosure; in fact, they were no help at all.
In my opinion Mitsubishi deserves to go the way of Suzuki and disappear from the American market.

I am having this great car for 2 months and got 4000 miles on it. It is so far so great and I am totally satisfied. Especially when you think about the vehicle's price, this is the best value you can ever get. It is very roomy and cozy for long long drive. We drove down to Vegas from San Francisco and to Los Angeles and again drove back to SF (it's about 1k mile) with 3 people and one cello case (which is bigger than golf case) and 2 big luggage and few bags and waters etc in the car.
Car was running very good at hills with 3 people and such load in it. And since this is manual transmission, you get more power than cvt and probably more mpg if you put little more
effort on it.
