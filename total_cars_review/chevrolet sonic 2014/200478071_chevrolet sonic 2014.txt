I have one whale of buyers remorse. Seems it wont go away. Maybe Sonic needs to go. Transmission works when it wants to, fails to downshift into lower gear when its needed. The automobile has the worse value for a car with 12 thousand miles on it and new Michelin Pilot tires
The roof has been painted, suspension parts have been replaced. Car runs ruff in neautral as well in drive idling, have rectified some of ruff idle I use 93 octane seems to help somewhat also synthetic oil has helped to. Gas mileage is just a couple of MPG than my 2000 Nissan Truck, and the truck you couldn't tell it was running. The Sonic idles like the 4 cylinders of 20 years ago. GM should be shot. Selling such junk
