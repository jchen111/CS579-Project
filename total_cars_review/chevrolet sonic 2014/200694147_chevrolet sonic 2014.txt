When I started looking for a commuter car, the sonic wasn't even on my radar.  I read the mileage posts and the reviews.  Well I happened onto this sonic at a dealer who somehow happened to have 2 of the only turbo 6 speed cars in the state. Yes, 1LT is the model, sedan 1.4L turbo with a 6spd.  When I took it out on the freeway and hit 52mpg.  I knew the turbo was the car to have.  I commute 120 miles round trip each day.  Solid 44.3mpg with premium gas at 80mph with A/C on.  52mpg at 50mph and A/C on.  The 44.3mpg is normal in this car.  38-41 around town in stop and go traffic. Also I have over 10K on my car since july.
