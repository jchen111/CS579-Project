We bought the Dodge Journey because it was a great value, it was big enough for our family of six and it got better gas mileage than a mini van. The seats are very versatile, but with all seats up, the car's blind spot doubles.
The rear-most seats combined with the middle seat, block more than half of the rear window and all of the side windows.
And the middle seats are difficult to return to an upright position when someone has to get out from the back.
The stow bins are so shallow and small that they are practically worthless.
The car seats are not the most comfortable, mainly because the headrests are too far forward.

I just purchased the base American Value model, and don't regret it a bit.
The RAV 4 and the CRV were close to being the winner, when I gave Dodge another look.
I don't feel short changed at all, except I saved thousands off the sticker compared to those two.
Beautiful inside and out, with great build quality.
My kids love the back seats that move and recline, great for long trips.
The rebates the other guys did not offer really made it a no brainer.
Living in S. FL I didn't need or want a sun roof, so don't feel cheated out at all.
Runs smoother than the other options, less get up and go with the 2.5, but will save on speeding tickets.

This American Value Package is a deal.
You get options included that cost additional from other manufactures.
The car is great in the City and handles the Interstates well.
I can't think of a better car with options for this price.

We did not take the third row seating as it eliminates all the storage in the vehicle except for a space about the width of 1 suitcase standing on end.
We are only two people and use the car to transport ourselves primarily.
However, we take 2 grandchildren on occasion and need the storage behind the seating.
I am not sure haw this effects the acceleration but mine get up and goes pretty good!

Me and my wife purchased a 2013 Journey 4 cyl. about 3 weeks ago, and absolutely love it! We got it out of neccesity as we took in our 2 nephews and 1 niece, on top of our daughter, so we needed a vehicle with 3rd row seating. We don't want to spend a boat load of money, and we really didn't want to take a risk on something used. So after much research I found the Journey is the most affordable new SUV with 3rd row seating on the market. Dodge is definitely on the way up, and this vehicle doesn't disappoint with features of interior, even in a base model. It has touch screen interface, keyless entry and keyless engine start. Plenty of storage all things considered with the 3rd row.

I bought the 2013 dodge journey and fell in love with it but after about 300 miles on the odometer the vehicle started pulling to the right . My first thought was that the tire pressure was the cause but tire pressure was ok. Also the vehicle started riding rough and so I took it back to the dealer. 2 days later I picked up the vehicle from the dealer and according to the work order description some adjustment had been made to correct the problem. But as soon as I drove off the dealer I realized that the problem was still there only this time was not as bad as before. 

I bought a new vehicle to avoid going to the mechanic but ironically I'll be going back a second time already.
