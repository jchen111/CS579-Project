I purposely looked for a "base" XLE without Navigation/Entune or rear entertainment (DVD) to get the more comfortable leather seats (front only, rear softex) and minimize options which would be expensive to repair after warranty. This is my second Sienna, with a 2011 Odyssey purchased in between. I've read comments about the Odyssey being a better van, BUT my 2011 Touring ended up having transmission and engine issues, and it was an expensive vehicle. The Sienna has a great engine/trans combo, and the interior is very comfortable and spacious.

Cheap plastics, fabrics (floors), finishes in cabin makes its interior look cheap even though I've got XLE+Navi option. Comparing to previous Sienna model with same trim option, it has less leather surface than older models to save its cost. You will find other cost saving effort from Toyata, unless you are paying $40.000+ for limited edition. 

Check its keyless remote, interior finishes, XLE's leather finishes/quality, they are lower than average car. Especially you are also considering Oddysey Ex-L+Nav

I chose Sienna because of its smooth engine feel, but now regret.
In sum, $ per value, Odyssey is much better even though you may find Honda's MSRP is higher.

It was difficult deciding among Toyota, Honda and Kia. All have their good points and drive well. I bought the Toyota four weeks ago, and I am happy with the decision, though I'd probably be just as happy with the Honda and Kia. I have the blind-spot monitor option ($500) and like it a lot. On the Sienna it is on both side-view mirrors; on the Odyssey, it is only on the passenger side. The long-slide 2nd row seats allow for almost 19" of leg room in the 2nd row, though that would leave almost no leg room for the 3rd row. Both 2nd and 3rd rows have shades. Entune and navigation system are great. Lots of cargo space behind 3rd row. 3rd row seats store easily, but not as easily as Honda's.
