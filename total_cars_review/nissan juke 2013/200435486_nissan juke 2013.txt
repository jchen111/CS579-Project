A
manual Juke is a blast to drive. The clutch, shift linkage and synchos are top notch, and give a sport car feel to the vehicle.It handles well ( moderate lean on aggressive cornering) for a CUV, and the steering is quite quick and precise.Brakes have a good feel as well.There is little cargo area, with the seat up, but when I need to haul something, the seat quickly folds and it is adeqaute for normal Home Depot and Costco runs. If you want to tote a 4X8 sheet of plywood or an XMAS tree, get a truck.I wanted a sporty driving vehicle, with a little cargo capability (our BMW Convertible is no help there), so the little Juke is perfect. No CVT for me, it would spoil the Juke's character.
