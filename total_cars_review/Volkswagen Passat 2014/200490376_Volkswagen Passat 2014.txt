We were looking for a car that had an upscale feel and appearance without the upscale cost. We were also looking for a car that was fuel efficient and did not want a hybrid.
The 2014 VW Passat Wolfsburg met most of our criteria.
It looks great and handles well on all types of driving conditions. The 1.8 turbocharged four cylinder engine gets decent MPG but feels a little underpowered.
However, it is quick enough to safely merge onto highways with adequate power for most situations.
My wife and I really love this car and would recommend it to others.
