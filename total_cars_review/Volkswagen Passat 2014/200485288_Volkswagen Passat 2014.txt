My love of cars has spanned a fair number of years and over two dozen cars. This is my second VW. I traded in a 2008 BMW 535xi Sport for this car, which had replaced a beloved 2002 Audi A6 2.7T.  The Passat has reminded me of the many reasons I am a fan of VW Group cars. I was concerned that the transition out of the driving experience of the BMW would be rough, but I was wrong. The Passat is  comfortable, spacious, well-appointed, reasonably quick, and sneers at gas pumps (I drove from NJ to Boston and back on one tank of regular fuel). It is not going to win stoplight drag races or autocross rallies, but as a large family sedan, it's really tough to beat. Glad I ignored the naysayers!

This car is fun to drive and gets good fuel economy.
However, it has a loud cabin and wind noise is loud.
The fuel economy is great.
However, the back up camera and audio system are so slow to respond, you want to just punch the system in frustration.
My Ipod cable doesn't work after two cables were tried, my back up camera takes 15-20 seconds to kick on when I put the car in reverse.
Lastly, for a vehicle that is fully loaded and MSRP's in the $32K range, it doesn't come with a USB Port?
Even a work truck Silverado comes with 2 USB ports.
Overall, I can't wait to get rid of this car.
I will never buy or recommend a VW product after this experience.
