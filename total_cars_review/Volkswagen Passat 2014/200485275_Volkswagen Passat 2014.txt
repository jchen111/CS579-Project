Cons.  Everything else.  Radio/GPS is the worst I have ever had.  Often when your first turn the car on the radio/nav won't respond to commands for 1-2 minutes.  When I put the car in reverse the backup camera doesn't come on for 1-2 minutes also.  By that time I am long out of a parking space.  Worthless.  Navigation won't allow address entry for the first 1-2 min.  The Nav entry system is cumbersome and just poorly designed.  Remote start is also designed by a moran.  You have to start the car and then restart the car when you enter it.  VW-carnet is worthless.  It is as though Vw just threw somethin
