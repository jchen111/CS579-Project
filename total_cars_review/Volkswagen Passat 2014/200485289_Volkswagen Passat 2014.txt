Having gone through literally a dozen or more of newer type cars over the last decade I can safely say that this car lives up to and exceeds expectations.
No car is perfect and there are a couple of annoyances such as the traction control (too intrusive), or the slow navigation unit; but car is fantastic.
I've had it 2 months and average right at 40mpg all the time.
I just took it on a 1100 mile trip and averaged 42mpg going between 75 and 84 mph.
Also, acceleration is great all around.
This is only the third car I've owned that exceeded gas mileage (others were 2013 Mercedes and 2008 Golf GTI).
Overall the car is solid with no rattles. It's an excellent family car. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Researching The Cost:
I researched and test drove many vehicles, including Ford Fusion Hybrid, Lincoln MKZ Hybrid,
Lexus Hybrids, Honda Hybrids and even some fuel efficient Buicks.
I considered that if I was going to get a car that had great gas mileage, then the sticker price had also better make sense.
I didnt want to pay an extra $8k for a car that would save me only $2k in fuel costs.
So, it had to make sense base upon sticker price, residual value and fuel economy.

The Passat came out ahead because the car was less expensive than the others (even loaded), and had an acceptable high fuel economy.

Like the title says, this really is my dad's Volkswagen. I traded in my '12 GolfR for this after my dad's glowing review of his '13 TDI SE. This is my 4th VW, and I'm as happy as ever. Build quality is top notch, with a lux leather/suede combo for the seats, and upgraded faux woodgrain for the '14 model. Gas mileage (why we buy these) is better than advertised. On 85 miles of mixed driving yesterday, I averaged 43+mpg when I parked at my door. The Fender sound system is great, and Bluetooth seems more clear than in my GolfR. The leg room in the back is incredible, and there's quite
a bit of trunk space (though not as much vertical space as you might hope). Overall, I'm thanking my dad.
