Bought this earlier today to replace an 03 Camry. I tested this vs the base Santa Fe Sport. While the Sport was a smoother ride, it was slow and the standard options were underwhelming. 
Next, I drove the Tuscon LTD FWD. Even though the ride is stiffer, the little 2.4 ltr engine has plenty of get up and go. The standard features on the LTD are plentiful and useful. Options added,
mats. cargo net, cargo tray, first aid kit, mudguards and wheel locks. I got the Garnet Red w/ Taupe leather int. It's a sharp looking car. I got an awesome deal on the car.
Very awesome vehicle for the money in today's market. IMHO This is my 2nd 2013 Hyundai purchased with the last 30 days. I love Hyundai.
