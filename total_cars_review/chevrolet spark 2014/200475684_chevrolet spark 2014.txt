I test drove a 2014 Spark at my local dealership, I noticed the "check engine" light was on when the salesman and I returned to the dealership.
I like the car's build so I purchased another Spark, one with more up grades on it, It had only 11 miles on it.
I bought the car and after just 3 1/2 weeks, the "Check Engine" light came on in my new Spark while on my way home from work white smoke poured out from under the bottom of the car.
I am very disappointed because I was so proud of my little car.
 I am in a rental waiting on GM to send a new motor
