After looking for a high mileage, low cost car that has a real backseat or can fit 3 dogs with seat folded down, Spark was the best choice.  Test drive was impressive.  But, the honeymoon is over at 14,000 miles.  2 recalls being done (a/c that is very anemic and PVC), the car hesitates at times so bad, you press the accelerator and it just sits there...scary! (CVT)  It lurches, especially at slow, parking lot speeds.  "Quirky" at first, now it's annoying and more pronounced.  Sound system is crappy, though touch screen is nice.  Various int. noises come and go.  Build quality for the long haul appears very questionable.
