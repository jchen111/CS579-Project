My wife loved the looks of the new explorer so..she  got a 2013.
From day one I thought it a slug, noisy on the highway and just plain mediocre. AT 30,000 mi the paint started bubbling on the aluminum hood, I brought it to ford at 36000 so it would be covered by warranty.The dealer said it was obviously a defect but Ford wont cover it.They don't have to, read your warranty it is only covered if it perforates the body panel. Besides the leaking gas tank that was pouring out all over my garage my other complaints are mpg like a v8 with 4 cyl performance. Terrible slushbox tranny

The only issue I have is the Third row you can only on get in on the drivers side.
Not much room back there. 
Wish I had mode lighting on this one.
Gas is not as good as my Edge but I knew this before I got it.

I wish I had rented this car for a while before I purchased it.
I was looking for a car that had capacity similar to a minivan without being one.
For storage, it is better than most SUV's.
On the down side, the visiblity from all perspectives is poor due to the design of the small windows.
This is just dangerous.
The hood of the car also sits high and is more difficult to see over compared to other, even larger, SUV's.
And I don't what they were thinking when it came to the drink holders.
They are few in # and quite nonfunctional, ie, no mug handles and too deep so you can't pick up your drink. The rear holders are at your feet.
Yuk.
They forgot comfort, convenience and even safety.

Ford Xlt v6 with leather and bench seat.
Wife bought car while pregnant but before we had car seats.
We had twins, so two car seats britax. With car seats install driver and passenger knees are against the dash. I am 6 ft, wife is 5 ft 10 in. Traded with mother-in-law for her 2013 gmc Acadia. 
Nice exterior lots of good comments 
Interior looks nice
Sync system voice recognition is slow (as compared to my Hyundai genesis coupe)
Leg room is poor with car seats
Drive is more responsive a better than the Acadia

We traded in our 09 Odyssey that was starting to have Tranny issues at 31,000 miles. Honda stone walled us so we went looking. Almost got the Highlander limited but tested the Explorer, liked it more, and got a good deal. About an hour after getting home I couldn't get the Navigation the Salesman said was on the vehicle to load up (like on a different explorer we test drove to get the feel, got a different color one). I called the dealer and they said I didn't have the voice touch screen Navi, just the Sync one. P'Od is all I have to say, Sync is horrible and my now "deal" looked normal to overpriced.There is also a high pitched chirp/whistle from the engine 3.5 V6 Returning it tomorrow!!!

Was in the Market for an affordable Mid-Size SUV, the Nissan Maxima was getting a little to small for our family. Looked at Honda Pilots first, was not impressed with service but interested in the Pilot. Went to Ford, just for kicks. Very surprised at how nice the explorer was when test driving. VERY COMFORTABLE!! Told the sales man that we were still going to go back to Honda and see what kind of deal we could get. He encouraged us to take the Explorer home for a night, then take it to Honda the next day. In his words, " If you drive this car a night you will like it way more than the Pilot." He was right. Handles great, Features are Awesome, Just enough room for us! Great Buy So Far!
