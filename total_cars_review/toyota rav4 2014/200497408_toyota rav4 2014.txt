I was having several problems with my 2013 Ford Escape, needed something reliable. I had always owned Chevrolet and Ford.
Decided to give Toyota a shot for reliability. I am very pleased with my purchase.
The transmission is smoother than the Escape.
Voice commands are much better than the Microsoft Sync System.
Interior room is wider and back seat leg room is bigger.
For the value, the XLE comes with sunroof and several other features standard.
The APPS button on radio is great, Weather provided by Weather Channel, along with traffic.
Works in areas with HD FM signals, I did not opt for the Navigation.
MPG much better than Escape.
I would highly recommend the Rav4.
