I really love my Sonata, turbo.
It is very stylish and gets great mileage. I drive to the Jersey coast during the summer, it's a flat, straight drive at 65 MPH standard which means everyone drives at 75. I can get 37 MPG at 70 MPH in cruise control. I've checked this a half dozen times already. I'm positive this will improve with a K&N air filter.
It's very responsive, can hardly hold it back. I thought I'm really going to get in trouble speeding on I-95 with this car but so far I lucked out. Love the price and warranty. Last car was a 07 Tucson which I also liked but not the mileage. Owned it a year now and no problems. Two thumbs up and a smile.

This is my third Sonata, a 2007, 2010, now a 2013.
Each is better than the last.


I have the Limited with the 2.0 Turbo. It is as fast as the old muscle cars, but smoother and more conomical. 

Interior is nicer than in the past, dash layout is good and the instrument panel lighting is very sharp.
Seats are comfortable and both front and back are heated.


Compared to my V-6 Sonata, I'm getting 3 to 4 mpg better milage and with better performance.


As for reliability, none of my Sonatas ever needed warranty service.
The style is better than cars costing twice as much.
Every time I park next to a luxury car, I still prefer the Sonata styling and the high quality of the pain

Bought my "Sparkling Ruby" Sonata on 5/26/12 and just don't want to park it!
It's so fun to drive and very smooth.
Great deal for so many options.
Would definitely recommend.
