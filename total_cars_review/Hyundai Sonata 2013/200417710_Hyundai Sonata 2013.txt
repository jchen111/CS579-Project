The 2013 Sonata is a very nice looking car.
I traded in a 2010 Elantra for the Sonata.
The Elantra is a much better car than the Sonata.
The Sonata has a very rough ride, especially at highway speeds.
I expect this to lead to abnormal tire wear.
The GPS/Radio/Bluetooth/AC combination is poorly designed and difficult to use.
The combination design gives you control over one function at a time.
For example, when the navigator is active and you receive a call, the navigator goes to the background.
If you are on the call when you need to make a turn, you will miss it.
The voice recognition feature is absolutely horrible.
I have gone to using an external GPS and avoid using the built-in

Bought a new 2013 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.4L 4-cyl, 6-speed Automatic. Got black exterior with chrome accents. Under $22,000 delivered with Hyundais Presidents Day incentives (which was about $6,000 off MSRP). Need to drive from around Gettysburg, PA to Virginia twice a week for work.
Need a car that is good on the Interstate, stop & go traffic, and curved roads along the Potomac River.
The Sonata has more precise steering and more power than my 2007 Camry LE. The 2007Camry has more of a luxury ride. Both average 30 mpg. 2013 Camry doesn't have luxury feel like my 2007. 2013 Altima has quality problems. 2013 Ford Fusion needs 305 hp Mustang V6 and better discounts. Sonata wins!

I have only had this car a month but absolutely love it.
The gas milage is great. You can't get a better car for the money. No complaints.
