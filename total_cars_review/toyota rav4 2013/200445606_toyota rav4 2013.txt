The air conditioning is awful in this car. There are no vents for the back seat and therefore my hands are numb from the air conditioning while driving yet my daughter in the back seat is dripping in sweat. We bought this car in the winter and wish we had been aware of this. We asked Toyota about it and all we got is the car is small enough the vents weren't required. Well they went the cheap way and therefore it is awful to drive with passengers in the summer. 

We also had both metal bars that adjust the seats break already. You would think with a semi nice car the seats could be motor controlled. Other than these 2 big discomforts we like the car a lot.

The dashboard/speedometer is set back into a tunnel. In any other car when you turn the ignition key on the dashboard/speedometer illuminate. Not the case in the RAV4. It stays dark. So dark, that when you are driving downa tree lined street or on a cloudy day, its almost impossible to see the speedometer. This is a design flaw in the vehicle. I have to turn my night time lights on during the day to see the speedometer clearly. A very dangerous situation! I have tried talking to corporate in California and they will not do anything about this problem. I have not contacted the BBB, The Dept. Of 
Consumer Affairs and the Attorney Generals office.

For starters ... I rushed to upgrade from a 2011 Rav4 model I loved to a 2013 model I don't like very much.
After 5000 miles of city and highway, this SUV consistently disappoints.
While many overall improvements have been made as listed in great details throughout the other reviews, the fundamental issues are the power/train. combo and also the tire change up in this new model.
This is not a fund vehicle to drive (unlike the 2011 model).
The car feels sluggish, hesitant and often puzzled as if it doesn't know what gear to go into and when (automatic version and AWD).

I owned a 2006 Rav4 (V6, 4-Wheel) and put 135K miles on it before purchasing my new I-4 Rav4 2013. ItÂs been a love-hate relationship with the new. I loved the old one. I have 3,500 miles on the 2013, which I purchased on 5/21. Today is 7/24/13. I bought the all-wheel drive and have been getting 28 mph, doing mostly highway/thruway driving. I tend to use ECO for long hauls on interstates, Sport for short bursts up hills, and the regular setting for other times. What I dislike is the odd placement of the ECO and Sport buttons, which must be activated way under the radio and NAV system. ItÂs hidden, inconvenient, and dangerous. The black bumpers streak terribly when washed.

I'm one of those people that need to research everything to the nth degree before I purchase. I researched and test drove many small SUV's....... For the price, features, ride quality, performance, and overall bang for the buck you can't beat the newly designed 2013 RAV4. I honestly could not be happier with my purchase and absolutely enjoy driving this vehicle. The XLE trim level has the most bang for the buck with many standard features you'd have to either pay more for or purchase the top trim level to get it in other SUV's. Completely happy with purchase.....you can't go wrong with the 2013 RAV4!"

We started our car shopping with about 30 cars of various van, sedan, hatchback, and SUVs on our list.
We tracked everything in spreadsheet from safety, mileage, price, everything.

After several test drives and reviews the 2013 Rav4 was the winner with the most features, cargo capacity, mileage, safety, and driving performance.

The Honda CRV 2013 was our 2nd choice but it wasn't fun to drive, felt sluggish with no "go" feeling.
The Rav4 has the acceleration, handling, and styling that the Honda does not.

I traded in my 2010 Tundra for the all new Rav4 and couldn't be happier! I LOVED my truck, but I DIDN'T love parking it, filling it up with gas, paying the $500 car tags every year, so on and so on. I am really loving all the money I have already saved, how easy it is to park and I am shocked at how comfortable the car and ride is in comparison to my Tundra (which I consider to be the best I've ever experienced). I am so happy I got the Rav4 and totally recommend it!
