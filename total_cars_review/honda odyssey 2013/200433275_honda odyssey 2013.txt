All-in-all the 2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite is a fine mini-van.
We traded in a 2010 Cadillac Escalade for the Odyssey.
We are exceptionally pleased with the overall comfort and flexibility of the seating configuration.
I wish the passenger front seat offered 10 way adjustments for longer trips & comfort.
My biggest issue is with the navigation system. It only displays a few street names when zoomed in on the map.
This is a first of any car we owned with navigation.
Shame on Honda for not updating their software to be on par with almost all other NAV systems currently manufactured.
Honda tech support is aware of the issue.
Besides these two minor issues it is a great mini-van.

This is our 2nd odyssey , first one is 2005.
It is a much improvement, very refined quiet, very comfortabe, and fun to drive. it takes the curves better than the old odyessey, despite of the reduced road feel secondary to the electric power steering. The driver seat is very comfortabe. I choose this over the Mercedes GL 450, essentially I have every thing for 1/2 the price and Honda reliblity and good resale value.
the car does not lack any horse power, push the gas and vtec kicks in at 4000 rpm and the car flies, most of the time you do not need that with family and kids. It realY feels liKe a sedan. 4000 miles no problems.
Gas consumption much better than my old odyassey.

We traded in our 2006 Odyssey for a 2013. My first impression is its much quieter than the old model. Gas mialage seems to be better as well.Front legroom seems a little less though. Hopefully this one will be as reliable as the last.
