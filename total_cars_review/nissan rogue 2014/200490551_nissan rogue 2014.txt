We got hustled into buying a 2014 Ford Escape SE. Traded it two weeks later for the 2014 Nissan Rogue SV w/ premium package. Best decision ever! The only issues we've had are 1. the nav screen will say loading & you have to cut the car on & off a few times to get it to work. 2. The air takes about 5 mins to get cool. We live in a pretty hot place but even when the temp drops, the air still takes awhile to get cool. Asked the dealership about it. They did nothing. For a brand new car 5 mins to have COOL (not cold) air is ridiculous. Anyone else have this air issue??

I bought a Nissan Rogue 2014 SV full package with moon roof, on December 2013.
Since than I had to come back to the dealer few times: 
First it was missing All wheel drive Harness, they simply forgot to install it on my car. There was no AWD nor Hill descent, the part was ordered and installed.
It kind of makes you think, what else did they forget to install?.
But the best one yet, I noticed that area under passenger seat is moist,I thought it was spilled water and ignored this at first, but it kept coming back more and more, took it to the dealer. He said it was clogged sun roof drain, that he fixed, few days passed
to my surprise I notice around 1" of water under passenger seat today.

Had the car only for a week now but purchased other Nissan vehicles in the past so I can pretty much attest to the quality. We looked at the CR-V (read about dim headlight issues) and the RAV-4 prior before purchasing the rogue. The exterior of the RAV-4 is bland and the interior is downright horrible and cheap looking. The Rogue is just as comparable to the RAV-4 in terms of cargo space but is dare I say.. slightly luxurious in regard to interior! We have the black cloth seats along with the moonroof which are simply beautiful. High quality interior materials, ample space, sleek exterior, quiet, simple controls, good gas mileage, and just a comfortable ride. Get it!!

this vehicle has a luxury vibe, even without leather seats. great interior, with pano roof. very smooth operator overall. gas mileage is never what they advertise, except on my altima, which is at least 32 overall. bottom line, technology and manufacturing methods have trickled down to the point where lower priced cars are just as good. had 11 lexus cars and this rogue rides as good as any of them...enjoy!

We looked at a lot of suvs used and new, when we added up the standard features the new gas mileage, the features and the package option that added a lot more for less than 1500 dollars this wa a no brainer.
the safety features are great and at the price of the vehicle this is not even available in comparable suv's.
the MPG in the 2014 models is enticing and makes you fell better buying this vehicle.

The 2014 rogue rides very smooth and I personally find it fun to drive.
The car comes with a lot of amenities such as signals on the mirrors, push button start and access, single action fold down seats, LED daytime running lights, etc.
The SV trim also comes standard with dual auto climate control and color radio screen.
I got the premium package which has a nav system that works well enough.
The interface can be a little quirky, however.
The interior of the car has a very upscale feel to it especially considering the price point.
It feels like you are in a much nicer car.
I have not had the car long enough to really give an accurate review on reliability or gas mileage.

Just bought my 2014 Rogue SV with AWD a few days ago.
Overall I really like the vehicle and think styling inside and out is much improved from the 2013 version.
I am a pretty dedicated Nissan owner but also checked out the Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4, and Chevy Equinox.
I was sold on the Rogue's interior - looks and feels very upscale, better than its competitors, and the cabin is huge.
The Sirius XM radio is awesome and Nissan gives you a 90-day trial to test it out.
Mine came with dual climate control (have never had that before and love it!), pushbutton start, backup camera, and an extended power moonroof and it listed for just over $28,000.
So, I feel the value was great.
