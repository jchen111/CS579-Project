I traded in my 2006 Jeep Laredo for a 2013 Malibu. I was skeptical in the beginning as I'd never owned a Chevy and hadn't owned a sedan since my Honda Accord over 15 years ago. I was seeking something that was fuel efficient (better than my Jeep, which was horrible), that looked good, durable, and didn't hurt my pocketbook. As a teacher and single mom with two kids remaining in my budget is essential. This car does it for me. I love the look, the smooth ride, and my monthly payment. My kids love it as well! Even though I've only had my new car for three days, I can already see that I will be saving on gas. Oh and love the automatic start button!

Yes...at 2333 miles ya'll! I was in the middle of 5pm traffic in Little Rock, AR and when I went to make a left turn at a VERY busy intersection, my BRAND NEW 2013 Malibu would go NO WHERE! Luckily I was less than about 100 ft from the dealership where I "leased" it.. Long story short...being it was a lease, it went BACK! ASAP!!! I dont know if anyone else has yet to have this horrible experience yet, but I can definitely feel yet another recall coming on for these cars... I loved that car too!!
