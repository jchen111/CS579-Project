 This is the third Malibu we have purchased since 2004 (from the same dealer and the same sales representative) and each model has been better than its predecessor. The 2013 model has an excellent power train  the 2.0 liter turbo charged 4-cylinder engine, coupled with the new 6-speed automatic transmission, performs better than the 3.0 liter V6 engine in our previous 2008 model.
The interior and exterior are both well designed, the interior is comfortable, and the car drives and rides well.
I have only driven the vehicle 200 miles to date so cant comment on fuel economy yet, although my first top-up suggests that it will meet the EPA city mileage estimate.
