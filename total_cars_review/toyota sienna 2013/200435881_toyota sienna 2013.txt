We like the seinna in general. Its comfortable, best driving minivan we tested.
 Lots of space.

What we dont like is the navigation system is one of the worst I've ever used. Its voice entry is slow and error prone, it's display is cluttered and hard to get what is important, it is hard to follow in a city with close turns.
Its just bad.
My $100 garmin is much better.

Not only did I spend 15x that for this system, but they also take out the XM capable radio to do it. 

Other complaints are gas mileage is only 18-21, the heated seats dont let you turn on back vs legs, and in general the seats are not as comfortable as I would expect in this class.
And the tires are expensive!
