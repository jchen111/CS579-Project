I bought a 2013 Toyota Sienna in January 2013. It is currently below 2000 miles. . At 60% weight load capacity, the ground clearance goes down to about 5 inches.
I get honked on highway asking me to pull over and check-out the rear. The weight load capacity specified in the Toyota User Manual is 1355lbs. Even the dealer is suggesting me go buy an aftermarket solution to fix the issue. This is a true safety issue. DonÂt even think about installing a tow hitch for a bicycle etc. The vanÂs rear suspension is too weak to handle a tow hitch with the weight of bicycles.

I test drove the Grand Caravan, Odyssey, and Sienna before buying.
The Dodge felt cheap & rough, the Odyssey was good, and the handling was tight, but it felt like a sports car - transmitted every little bump thru the suspension in a violent way.
Also, as I test-drove a 5-speed Honda, the Sienna had noticeably better acceleration.
The Honda had less comfy armrests, and no available center console on the base model.
For the same price as the base Honda, I got a Sienna LE with power seat, power doors, a nicer ride, satellite radio, and a better reliability record.
Only complaint for the Sienna is the driver's "dead pedal" area on the left is too close for comfort.
Awesome car & purchase.
