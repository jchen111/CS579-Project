We bought the RAM 1500 in Feb 2013.
It ran great for 9000 miles, averaging 22 mpg city/25 mpg highway.
On a trip to the Florida Keys, the "check engine" symbol was displayed
flashing and the truck automatically shut down while we were traveling at 60 mph on a busy highway.
VERY unsafe condition. We finally were towed to a dealership.
They replaced an ignition coil.
Five miles later it happened again.
Had to get towed once again.
Dealership found that it was a short in the wiring bundle.
Problem finally fixed.
Overall cost to us - $400 (rental cars, hotels, etc.).
Called RAM to see if they would provide some compensation, and they said sorry about that.
Nice support there.
