Have had this car for 3000 miles in 3 months. Happy with my choice so far.

I am 6'-2" and I have two toddlers. My wife is already driving a minivan. So, i was looking for a car that can fit the whole family occasionally, yet compact enough to fit the short street curb between driveways in san francisco, versatile, two car seats, good looking, satisfying to drive, sit high, around $22,000 (out of the door), good mpg for my long commute and respected. I have found all these in my new cx-5.

I was not considering mazda. But then, i got a chance to drive a mazda3 rental with a skyactiv engine. I re-discovered the driving experience I loved so much with my old BMW 3 series.

I was looking for a new vehicle to use for work.
My wish list included 1. Plenty of room in back for sales materials 2. Combined EPA mileage of at least 27.5 mpg (company requirement to get an extra $100/month in car allowance) 3. Manual transmission 4. Sporty handling & fun to drive. I researched a LOT of vehicles, and the CX-5 was the only one I found that met all of my needs. I have already put over 10k miles on it in 3 months.
Fuel economy in mostly highway driving has been over 30mpg. I drive around 78mph on the interstate.
In 6th gear the rpms are 3200 at this speed.
It would get even better mileage at 60-65mph.
So far it has performed flawlessly. I'm very happy with my choice!
