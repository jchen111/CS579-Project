The car is good - a little more sluggish than I expected, but still cute and fun.  The problem is the technology package.  After 4 months, I can say that I have given it my best shot, and it sucks.  We have another car with similar features and this one is so sub-par.  The touch-screen is so painfully slow, the features are clunky, entering in an address is horrible, and you can only do it while stopped - even if you are the passenger, so plan ahead!  The voice control is totally useless.  The Sirius radio loses the signal if you drive under a thick tree.  And the phone bluetooth hook up keeps crapping out. If the technology package is important to you - look elsewhere.

Just a tremendous car if you appreciate handling and enjoy driving.
Has me looking forward to highway on-ramps and off-ramps.
So stable and planted in corners!
Good power, nice 6-speed Auto Transmission (love the paddle shifters on the Grand Touring), mileage is excellent -- easy to get between 35-40 on the highway at normal speeds, and even in-town, it usually gets around 30.
It rides firm, no question:
if you want a cushy ride, this isn't your car.
But it rewards you every time the road starts to curve, and always delivers really good mileage.
Good interior space, nice flat trunk, nice back seat.
This is absolutely a must-see if you're considering any of the other family sedans.

have had the car a little over a week, 15 GT in Reflex Blue with the almond leather package...and people on the street ask about it everyday...the car is just so dang beautiful that people want to know more about it....I don't have time to tell people about how great the car is...its great in every way so far! 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't had the car a week yet but so far so good.
I agree with the others that it's arguable one of the best looking cars on the road today.
I also like that I'm not lumped into the "Camry and Accord" group. There simply aren't that many Mazda 6's on the road so it's nice to be a little different.
I can see why they charge more for red or white.
I went with white since so many of my friends have red cars.
It looks great! I traded in a Corolla for this car so naturally it feels super loaded to me and it is.
It's got literally everything.
I've had several BMW models in the past and I like to feel the road and that's what you get with the huge 19" wheels.

After placing an order in March of '13, I got my vehicle in August and I now have 16K trouble free miles on it. After reading virtually all of the available reviews on affordable mid sized sedans and driving those that I was willing to consider (Honda, Toyota, Chevy, Hyundai and Subaru), buying a 6 was an easy decision. The car has met all of my expectations for a fun to drive sedan that gets solid gas mileage and that does not look like everything else on the road.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the best car I've ever owned. I've owned Acuras, VWs and Toyotas. This car is hands down the most comfortable and fun to drive of all these cars. Also gets the best mileage, a really remarkable event in a car this size. 29mpg 60% hwy, 40% cty.

We are all aware that the 6 does not have the largest nor highest res nav screen. Those who need a large nav screen so they can pay less attention to the road have many choices.
I prefer something simpler and have found the 6's easy to use, with excellent turn-by-turn in particular.
 If you want a car with two meaningless chrome rings in a loopy center stack, and a geriatric speedometer, I'd certainly recommend an Accord.

I am so pleased with this car. It is stylish and sleek. The design is distinctive. It rides very smoothly and gets great gas mileage. I like to drive, and in this car, I feel very connected to the driving experience. The steering is responsive, the fuel economy is great, yet the power is there when you need or want it. Interior is comfortable, ride is quiet, Bose stereo system is great.

I drove an Acura TSX for 10 years and 175k miles and it was hard to let go. I researched for a year and narrowed down to 4 cars: Mazda6 GT, Honda Accord EX-L 4-cyl, Audi A4, and BMW 328. I quickly deleted the German cars because I didn't want to pay for premium fuel. Nothing wrong with the Honda, just a boring drive, but great features.
When I sat in the 6, I knew I was home, great overall experience with all the creature comforts and Great MPG's. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had a 2005 Mazda6 Hatchback and loved it but the 2014 takes the 6 to a whole different level. I fell in love with the exterior styling as soon as I saw it.
When I had the opportunity to test drive it I was blown away, the car drives and handles wonderfully and the interior quality is second to none.
I do agree that the navigation system seems a little cheap but it works and everything else is so fantastic I don't mind it at all.
I read somewhere in a review "If Porsch made a car under $50,000 this would be it".
I couldn't agree more and I only paid $28K for the Grand Touring Edition (it was a demo the sales manager was driving).
Oh yea and the fule economy is excellent! 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted a five-passenger sedan that is agile, stylish, fuel efficient, equipped with the latest safety technology, and available for $30,000.
After much research, I found one vehicle that meets these criteria IMO: the 2014 Mazda6 GT.
 The Mazda6 is widely regarded by professional and consumer reviewers as the drivers car in its segment.
Its good looks are perhaps rivaled by the Fusion and Optima, but personally I find the 6 more gracefully sculpted.
MPG is great at 28/40.
The suite of available safety features (listed below) is incredibleagain, the Fusion comes close, but for more money.
As for price, I
paid under $29,000 after dealer discount and Mazda rebates (+ .9% financing).
