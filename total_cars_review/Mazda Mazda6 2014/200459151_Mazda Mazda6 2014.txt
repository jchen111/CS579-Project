Have managed 32.6 MPG over 45k so far.  Love the handling-it is a blast to drive.  Could use a bit more HP.  The transmission is flawless.  It's nice to actually have a 6-speed instead of a CVT junk.  Stock tires are junk.  Opted to get 18" rims and 245/45/18 tires instead and the ride quality has improved a bit.  Just a blast to drive and the MPG is a huge bonus.  Have gotten a best tank of 578 miles and 37.9 MPG.  Would be happy to answer any questions as I have one of the highest mileage 2014's out there according to www.fuelly.com from what I have seen.

The car has a great appearance and seemed to be a decent value, but the fuel economy has not even come close to the averages seen on the window sticker.
The sticker averages were 26 mpg in the city and 38 mpg on the highway.
My car is averaging 24 mpg and I drive mostly on highways.
Would not recommend!

If you like the handling of German cars but not the frequent repairs and upsized price, this may be the car for you.
The ride is comfortable but definitely firmer relative to Accord, Camry, etc.
My most recent cars were Audi A4, BMW 328 and VW Passat.
This car is larger than the first two and gets better mileage than all of them...for thousands less.

I checked for road noise at highway speeds based on many reviews and also, rough downshifts.
I have not personally experienced issues with either.

Wow how many superlatives are there in the English dictionary? I've had some pretty nice midsized cars in recent years - '11 Optima EX, 12 Sonata 2.0 Turbo limited (nice turbo power) & even an 09 Mazda6 Touring (which like a great indie film excellent but under publicized), but great as these all were in their own respects, none evoked the level of pure joy my meteor gray 2014 6 touring w/tech package has! Looks are subjective but I literally can't stop looking at it & snapping photos haha! Ride remarkably smooth despite 19" rims & tight suspension. Cabin dead silent at idle road noise not that bad. Great acceleration close to Sonata turbo despite 90 less hp. Fantastic car!!!

I've had Honda, Ford, Acura, and Hyundai's, but I love my 6!
I feel like James Bond in it, LOL!
The exterior styling is extremely stylish.
Just love, love, love this car in and out!

I have deep buyer's remorse. I agree with most of fawning reviews concerning the car's style and how it drives. But oh how I wished I'd examined it more carefully for practical lifestyle needs, when I went for that test drive. Subsequently, I was bummed to discover the only way to open and then lock the doors and trunk is to dig my key set with the key fob out of my pocket, rather than pushing a little button.
A couple days later I was shocked and mortified to discover that I cannot secure my identity papers or anything in the glove box or the trunk, because there's no valet system whatever--not even a key. I live in Los Angeles, and now I cannot valet, without removing a bunch of things?

Every review on here seems to be written by Mazda's PR dept.
This car has a major issue.

Everything about the car is excellent, except for the transmission.
It is flat out terrible.
Read the reviews at cars.com, this is not isolated.
In their attempt to save gas, Mazda has created a transmission that will not shift down unless you floor it, and then the pedal engages some sort of performance button imbedded in the floor and the car lurches forward unsafely.
Real world driving is miserable.
Every down shift is met with a delay sending your body forward, and then the car lurches forward a second later.
Simply awful.
Test drive in traffic, around corners, change speeds...you'll see.

Have a 2004 6i auto with 120K, and replaced a 2012 Golf 2.5 with the 2014 6. Very happy so far. No issues. Lots of good cars out there, so small things make big differences to us, like the shielded trunk hinges, covered cup holders in the console, and steering wheel controls. Controls are well designed and easy to use. Interior storage could be better: compared to the 04 6i, the dash pop up is gone, the door storage holds less, and the console loses the dual level storage. For us, the garage door opener sits in the dash cubbie, the book on CD goes in the passenger door cubbie, and the charging phone sits in the top of the console cubbie. That doesn't work in the 2014.

I owned the 2014 Mazda 6 Touring for about 1 month.
Love the exterior styling (grey) with the bright Sand interior.
Smooth shifting automatic even if the car is too eager to up shift.
Wish there
was a sport mode to keep rev higher but you can switch to manual mode.
The seat is a bit on the firm side.
There is a little more noise than your typical Honda or Toyota.
The 19" standard wheel looks great and help with the handling.
I owned a
V6 Maxima before so I do missed the extra horse powers.
Love the MPG, getting around 30-31 mpg on heavy foot.

Everything said here is true - this is an amazing car particularly for the money.
But the low engine speed throttle response concerns me.
After driving for 6 months and 5,000 miles I've consistently, but randomly experienced a problem that does not seem to be fixable.
About every fourth time I try to accelerate with the engine running 1000-1500 rpm, like making a turn from a light, the engine does not respond at all when I push on the accelerator.
It also seems like it wants to stall.
But after 2-4 seconds the car finally realizes that I want to accelerate and it springs forward.
Above 2000 rpm the engine revs just fine.
Like turbo lag the dealer service said. Great car, but for this.
