This SUV has solid power train. Would rate it higher if I purchased premium or limited.

The power train has little difference from the basic to touring. But extras are definitely not worth $10k.

Nav is a joke. Slow response. Hard to see the screen under sun. And no steering information from the vehicle?? Use your phone instead, because that's actually a better nav system. 

Mpg. You get 30+ mpg only when driving at 50 mph. At 70~75 mph, you get about 24 mpg.

Safety. Eyesight doesn't work well when facing sun or in the dark. So it doesn't help when the driver really needs some help. Also extremely sensitive gas pedal, and extremely insensitive brake pedal.

I test drove all of the small SUVs on the market and the Forester was far and away the most comfortable for me. I am 6' 5" and 225lbs and none of the other ones had anywhere near as comfortable a driving position. The visibility is great due to the big windows, especially in the back where the competition seems to have all put large pillars in the way. It is quieter than the Highlander that it replaced and I have been getting a combined 27 MPG commuting and as much as 32 on highway travel.

Over the past 15 years, my family has owned Rav4, Honda CRV, Hyundai Santa Fe, Lexus RX330. This car is the most "friendly" of the bunch. Mileage at 29 for combined city/country. Plenty of power going up our hill at 7400 ft. Love the lack of shifting jerks common in 4 or 5 speed transmissions. Ride is stiff/responsive, but I wouldn't characterize as "jittery" at all. The voice recognition is way below the Lexus or Hyundai and the computer interface is not particularly user-friendly. The eye-sight works very well and is fun to use. Friendliness comes from the keyless lock and ignition system which turns on a light in the rear view mirrors as you approach, and makes it incredibly easy to lock.

I test drove 30 awd's out there and due to a family balance disorder, the ride requirement was the following: Highway smoothness, near zero body roll, zero cabin pressure (Suv must be vented properly) unlike VW tiguan, and no road vibration through the steering and seats. The 2014 was a clear and easy winner.
I have owned the forester for 2 months in the NE winter and this thing proves itself every day of my 70 minute tristate commute.
Coming from a BMW x5 I thought I would be unhappy - but this SUV is really a swiss army knife.
Insane in the snow/ice - great comfort, a kickin' stereo system. Computer readout of everything + X-Drive! + 27mpg avg + rock solid reliability LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!

I leased a 2014 2.5i Touring with Eyesight back in October and have now driven it 3,000+ miles, 2000 on a road trip.
It's my 2nd Subaru, and I'm impressed by the amount of boxes they can tick for interior space, design, capability, etc.
I'm a 6'4" guy so space and comfort are big points for me.
My only complaint with this and our last Subaru (same powertrain, 2.5 w CVT) is the MPG.
Both of my Subarus were rated at 24/32.
Our Legacy came in at 26 average across the 32,000 miles we drove it last year.
Thus far with the Forester we're at 23.
On the highway going the speed limit, I'm not able to break 27 with either car.
Going below 60 is the only way which is dangerous for me and others
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am 6'5" and my wife is 5'3" and we wanted something that we could adjust to both be able to drive comfortably. We tried a Forester last year, but the visibility was nowhere near as good and the interior seemed very cheap. The 2014 is a huge improvement.

I don't have to adjust the seat all the way back even with my 35" inseam legs. Visibility is much better due to the larger windows all around and the relatively straight roof line, unlike a lot of the competitors. After about 400 miles I am getting about 29 MPG of mostly highway driving. Overall I like the look and functionality. It isn't flashy, but is the most comfortable and practical of the crossovers out there.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I already have 8,000 miles on my Touring model with Eye Sight. I live in Houston but also own a home in Colorado. I have owned everything from Fords and Buicks, to Toyota, Honda, and Hyundais. The build and design quality of this Forester is truly outstanding in every way. The room inside relative to the size of the exterior is amazing. Seats are extremely comfortable, and I have back issues. The vehicle has a very pleasing tight feel.

This is our
2nd
foester- we have a
2011
Touring model as well as
the new 2014
Touring
model
(
i vesrsions) The
cars are very
differant, might
as well be made
by 2
differant
companies , they
so unalike- The
major
differances
 are
improvements
 to the
tranny
(now
CVT)
smoother
than the 4 gear jobby of
 our 2011--
beter gas
mileage
(3
to 4 miles
per gal improvement)
We have the
A/C on
continually ,
so do not get
EPA standard
ratings( 24/32 mpg)_pay
a penalty of
about
4 m/p/g
 less on average-
BUT
 the improvement of the
2011
Touring
model is a
average
of
3
to 5 m/p/g -
__
Interior
very
roomy- STARK

Just bought mt first Subaru this wekend.
We were set on the CRV but wanted to at least look at the Forester.
Well, we drove it home, done deal.
I will come back and post more once we get used to it.
So far it seems like an amazing little SUV.
A bit of electronic overload setting up the audio, but we have it all figured out now.


Good buying experience here with Heuberger Motors in Colorado Springs.
2.5i CVT Touring with mirror and rugged packages for $28,244.
Great people to work with.

I took delivery of my Forester on March 21.
I have about 4K miles on the car to date.
I traded in a 2005 Honda Element.
Boy, what an upgrade this has been.
The car is fun to drive and handles great.
I have been averaging about 30 MPG with a mix of highway and city.
The radio and navigation system are not difficult to operate as other reviews have pointed out.
My 10 year old daughter had it figured out in no time.
The nav system works great.
I had to meet some work colleagues at a supplier about an hour away from home and I was the only one who made it to the right location.
The others used the iphone and got lost.
