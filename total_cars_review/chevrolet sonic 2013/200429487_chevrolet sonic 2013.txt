This vehicle was my first new car.
Being a single mom and having to drive two young children around I wanted something reliable.
I didn't try and have my children attempt to get into the vehicle before purchasing but the rear door handles are up too far for my kids to reach.
Secondly, and more concerning there is an issue with the ignition.
My keys don't seem to want to go into the ignition.
And IF they manage to make it in they get stuck in the ignition.
I was stuck at the grocery store for ten minutes while I tried to get the car started because it seemed the tumbler was not engaging correctly with the key.
Chevy needs to make this right!!!!!!
