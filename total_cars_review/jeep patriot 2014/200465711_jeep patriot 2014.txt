To Jeeps credit they offer one of the few remaining SUVs with a stick shift. All others have gone luxury. I simply cannot stomach paying upwards and beyond 25,000 for a
4-banger (30k for a Outback with a 172hp, 2.5L,seriously?). As a person that prefers that smaller engines.4-cylinder, are mated to a manual this was the only real option in my price range. I purchased it at Elk Grove Jeep where there were 80 units on display. I knew I wanted a patriot and leaning toward a 4x4. From my experience test driving everything on the lot; avoid anything with the automatic, 2.0 or 2.4. Testing the 5M and the 2.4 with the 4WD off was immediately apparent. Torque off the line was strong!

My first vehicle was a 1965 American Rambler station wagon with three on the tree. The Jeep Patriot is no nonsense SUV that will take me wherever I want to go; moreover, It truly is an all-purpose vehicle without all of the bells and whistles. 
I have lived from the Caribbean to the Hawaiian islands and every time zone between (except Alaska), and this Jeep Patriot would be an asset in every past and future home; moreover, for its on- or off-road ability. 
However, in my case why finance stuff that I do not need.

I disregarded expert reviews and read owner reviews instead on the Jeep Patriot. I'm glad I did. I purchased my 2014 Patriot Sport 4x4 last month after looking at the CRV, RAV4, Escape, and Subaru XV. I'm 6'4' and have more than enough leg and headroom and like the simplicity of the Jeep's interior. Although, most 2014 Patriots come with a new 6-speed auto transmission, I opted for the Freedom Drive 2 package with the CVT. Last weekend, I took a road trip from middle North Carolina to middle Tennessee and back crossing the Appalachian Mountains on steep grades and winding roads. The handling is great, the steering's predictable, and the ride is smooth. Power is sufficient enough to get me up
