I purchased the 2014 manual version, because I understand that small engines and economy come at a price.
With the manual transmission, this car has fine acceleration and handling.
I live in NE, so the AC was no big deal to do without and I prefer manual windows and locks in the winter.
What's left then is a nice comfortable
SUV that has traction control, hill assist start, fog lights, cruise control, etc. for $12,900.
This is absolutely the best value for the money.
In fact, I traded in my 2010 RAV4, because of the litany of problems it had.
The amount I owed on the RAV was almost exactly what it cost me for the NEW Patriot with an excellent warranty.

I have never been a jeep fan, but I wanted a vehicle with decent room, good gas mileage, and inexpensive.
I looked at toyota, honda, and others, but prices were too high.
Then I read about the patriot here on Edmunds and got interested.


I reluctently went to the local dealer and drove one and I was shocked!
I selected a 4 cyl with front wheel drive and a 5 spd manual and it drives more like a honda accord than a jeep.
It is very basic (A/C is the only option) but I purchased the vehicle brand new for $13,288 including dealer doc fees.
(The MSRP was $18,000) 

My first tank ful of gas I got 30.1 mpg!
The Patriot is solid, an incredible value and highly recommended.
