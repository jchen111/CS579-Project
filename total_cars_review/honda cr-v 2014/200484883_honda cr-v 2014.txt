I've had the CR-V for 3months and 5000+ miles. It has a relatively comfortable ride, a Honda typical handling which is excellent. The noise level is very good. And the engine is responsive. But the sun visors are a joke, it can not telescope so it can not shield your eyes from the sun when you swing it to the side!!! The back seats can not recline so it will be
a torture for the passengers on long trips. I would not buy this car if I have a chance to do it over again.

would love to see a manual transmission brought backn in the CR-V.
would like to see the AC unit moved back like the 2008 2009 2010 models.
Why consumers aren't wising up is beyond me.
Who wants AC blowing on their hand all the time - that's why I gave the interior design a 2, otherwise, pretty perfect vehicle.
Would like to see the sun visors with a pull-out mechanism like in the toyota camry.
There is NO protection from the sun in this 2014 CR-V.
Zero.... get a towel because you're going to need one.
need to work on the visibility out of the vehicle on all viewing - sides & rear.

Is it cool?
No! Is it real and authentic? Absolutely!
The 240 Wagon of our times.
Cheap, cheerful, reliable, durable, functional, safe, just like the 240 wagon's were.


Will it impress your neighbors?
No, but there's no shame in driving it regardless of your demographics.
An upper middle class suburban white person can drive one without shame and have the smug knowledge that they did not fall into the douche bag "luxury" car trap - cue the hipsters in a few years.


Averaging 29mpg in mixed suburban / highway driving. I use the "econ" button mainly because it allows better control over the throttle.


Very happy overall.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope the 2015 CR-V model will put the AC vents like they were in the 2010 model.
I also hope they can change the rear view out of the vehicle, if possible at all.
Otherwise, perfect vehicle.
