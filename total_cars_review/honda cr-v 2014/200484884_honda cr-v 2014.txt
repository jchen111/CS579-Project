Recently picked up a LX AWD model a few weeks ago after driving Subarus for 10 years. The Honda is much quieter and the seats are much more comfortable than my last Legacy.

The folding rear seat mechanism is slick and has come in handy a number of times already. The radio is the base unit but sounds fine to me ears when streaming bluetooth.

Now that I have the back up camera, I will never have a vehicle without it.

MPG has been round numbers 21-22 in mixed NYC driving; hope it goes a little higher once the engine breaks in more, I only have 480 miles right now.

So far very happy with the purchase and look forward to many years of ownership.
