I am very disappointed that I have had my new 2014 CRV for three weeks and it has a problem with the differential. On the test drive, the AWD light came on and the salesman said it was nothing.
It has come on three times since, and after much discussion with the dealer they are going to put a new motor on the differential. This is very disappointing because I bought the CRV for its reliability. Would not buy CRV again.

Just traded in our 2009 CR-V for a new 2014 CR-V. My wife loved the 2009 but I thought it was just OK. DidnÂt plan to buy a new car but the trade in was so good I could not pass up the new CR-V. The 2014 is a far better car. I love it. Better body styling, better handling, a lot more quiet on the road, more comfortable, more upscale interior, more standard features, better acceleration and better gas mileage.

From a price/quality/performance perspective this is a great car, plus you get HondaÂs reliability. I recommend the EX-L model.

We did not notice the road noise while the salesman drove with us and talked during the drive.
We are also a disappointed in the lack of options included.
We did not realize until after buying the car there is not even a homelink control for a garage door opener.
The ride is quite stiff and the car seems to have a vibration above 60mph.
We have taken the car back to the dealer for them to evaluate but no luck in solving the problem.
We bought the car off the showroom floor and did not drive the specific car before purchase.

I read all of the 2013 reviews before purchasing my 2014.
I decided to go with the EX-L without navigation.
I couldn't imagine going without a passenger seat arm rest.
The dealer got me a 
CR-V without navigation (since those reviews are terrible) and without the entertainment system, which I don't need.
It looks good, runs well, has sufficient pickup even in ECO mode.
One reviewer complained about the headrest--but on the EX-L the seat is infinitely adjustable so that's easily corrected.
The sound system works sufficiently well for me.
Headlights seem to light just fine, but I drive only in well lit suburban areas.
Controls are easy to see and operate.

56 year old grandparents and mostly just the 2 of us and then our 2yr old grandson. I was looking for the best mpg med-small SUV with the most room, safety, quiet, and dependability. I was real close to getting the Mazda but I kept reading reviews of interior noise and back seat discomfort and I read too many complaints on the RAV4. I am more than pleased with the 2014 CRV. Comfort front and rear, good interior noise control & room, great ride, features,great gas mileage. In the first 1500 miles, the worst was(real) 24mpg with mostly town miles & best (real)33mpg highway with AC and packed full. I have no complaints! A feature that I did not know it had was the ability to downshift into 3rd.
