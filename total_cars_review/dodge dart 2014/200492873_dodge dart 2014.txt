Seems like the professional reviews on this site and others find some way of knocking the Dart, but I don't see what they are talking about.
I researched and shopped extensively (looked at the Veloster, Mazda3, etc.).
The Dart, by far, was the best driving experience of any of those.
Superb handling, good acceleration with the 2.4, quick braking, and it just feels solid.
Interior is high quality and spacious, exterior is beautiful.

There are not enough characters allowed on this to describe my distain for this vehicle.
Engine malfunction light came on in 200 miles. It is a faulting oil pressure sensor, they replaced and the light is still coming on. They are waiting for a software update that they "hope" will fix the problem.
Computer sometimes prohibits the car from accelerating over 4000 rpms. No fix. They don't know what is wrong. Again hope for a software fix. This is a real safety concern to me.
In cold weather the battery light dings and flashes on the dash annoyingly, again they hope a software updated can fix it.. We are now going through the lemon law process. I refuse to pay over $18k for a broken new car.
