I wanted a Flex and my wife talked me into the Explorer after driving the Explorer for 9 months we both agreed we did not like it.
Uncomfortable and just not pleased with the vehicle.
We went back to the dealer they were able to work a deal to get us out of the Explorer and into the Flex.
Could not be happier.
I love the way this vehicle rides and handles.
We use a car service in Florida for airport transportation and that is what the driver uses which is why I wanted the Flex my wife had a hard time getting over the box look.
It is a fund car to drive and I hope to have it for a long time.

I've owned this 2014 FLEX
SEL for 2 months and have driven over 2600 miles. It continues to be what I expected, a solid, good handling, reliable vehicle that carries 7 people for short trips or 4 and too much luggage for longer trips. We average over 22 MPG on the road. It's more comfortable, handles better, and carries more than it's GM competitors, Buick Enclave and Chevy Traverse.
