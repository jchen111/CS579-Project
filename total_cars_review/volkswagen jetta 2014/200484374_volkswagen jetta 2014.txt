I bought my 2014 Jetta SE in April 2014, it's was first brought in to the service dept. only a couple months old for the Airbag light. It took the dealership two weeks to figure out the problem. I'm still concerned that if the car is in an accident that the airbag system will work. The next time I brought it in, was last week. I had been complaining that every so often the ABS, Traction Control and Check Engine light keep coming on. The idiots in the service dept told me to turn the car off and restart it. The second time this happened I called yelling and screaming and they finally told me to bring it in.
