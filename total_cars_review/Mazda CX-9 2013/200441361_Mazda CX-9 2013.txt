I previously had a 2009 model I put 92,000 miles on and was happy.
This new model (2013) not so much.
The sheet metal seems thinner as the car easily picks up dings and dents.
The front brakes are pulsating and I do not drive the car hard.
The transmission constantly downshifts as soon as I tap the brakes and this is irritating.
The car sometimes clunks into gear when shifting from park to drive.
Finally, the central locking system is not intuitive.
I park in the garage and leave the keys in the vehicle.
On several occasions the car has mysteriously locked itself.
Thankfully I have a spare key in the house.
Still a decent car but would not buy again.

After a lot of research we decided to get the 2014 CX-9 Touring AWD with the Tech Package to replace our aging minivan.
Some of the other vehicles we test drove were the Dodge Durango and Honda Pilot.
The CX-9 had the best combination of interior space, looks, features, car-like driving experience and value for money.


After a month of driving around we have been really satisfied with the vehicle.
The vehicle is easy to drive and park which is unusual considering its large size.
The Touring w/tech package offers a lot of near luxury features(Navigation, Moonroof, heated seats, leather, Bose speaker) but still keeps the sticker price reasonable for a large SUV.

Bought spanking new CX9 AWD and was super excited. The drive is nice though the voice interface can be improved. 

Alas this was short lived and not to mention super frustating. So much so that I have decided to let go of the vehicle at a lose.

Why... because Mazda sold me a car for which they do not have spare parts. My car is in workshop for more than a month for simple parts like bumber and grill. They do not even have eta on the back orders.

The Customer service is no help and would not even consider a loner car. I am spending from my pocket. Even after the car is fixed I have lost complete faith in the brand.

Please do share this critical info with friends.

Recently turned in our Lexus RX 350, looking to spend a little less this time around.
The car is great (it's my second Madza; I also have a Mazda3).
The only two things I can think of to complain about are the navigation screen is a bit small, and the interior material just feel a little cheap.
But I guess they have to cut corners somewhere if I'm going to save this much $$$!!
Otherwise the car is great!

Test drove 7 SUVs and all were nice and capable but the CX-9 was the only one that really excited me after the test drive. Pilot, Traverse, and Pathfinder were too cavernous. Explorer had too many bad reviews (here, CR) and I rented one for a weekend and it was falling apart at 1700 miles. Acadia was overpriced.
Durango was a really nice ride and came in a very close second but was probably more SUV than I needed (I don't tow).
The CX-9 website does not do justice to the looks of this SUV. It is very sharp looking and people have given me nice compliments. Got it last week and drove 2 hours to Boston this weekend.
So comfortable.
Didn't want the drive to end. Fit kids and luggage no prob
