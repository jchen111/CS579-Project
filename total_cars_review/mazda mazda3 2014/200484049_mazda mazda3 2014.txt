This is the second Mazda I have owned. I was car hunting and decided to take a look at Mazda after looking at the other brands. The first thing that got me was the redesigned look. The previous models look good (better than the protege i had) but this new design looks real good. 

I thought I end up with the 2.5L engine so I have that extra power to it, but after test driving the 2.0L model, I figure i didn't need it. This is the same engine that goes into their CX-5 CUV model. So with this engine in a much lighter frame, it has a lot of zip to it .

One of the main reasons I choose the Mazda3 was to have email and text read out to me for safety reason. The feature doesn't work on Iphones and most other phones as promised by the dealer.
I checked the site after buying and could not find a phone where email worked and only a couple where text worked

Contact import is useless. It brings in the suggested names contacts from the phone. These do not have phone numbers or addresses so they are useless. It is limited to 1000 contacts so most real contacts do not get loaded. 
Can't get anyone in support to tell me if this will be fixed or if I am stuck using SIRI for calls and GPS addresses.
