great mpg but i am not a floor it driver. gives me the awesome sports car look without paying for the gas. I just wanted something more sporty and fun to drive but not have to fill the tank every week. color i got was meteor gray mica and looks sharp. it is a head turner at a lower end cost
level. i had a basic nissan versa ( crank windows ) which i just wasn't thrilled with. wanted some up to date inside car features with a sporty looking car on the outside at a low 200 payment. i call this the lexus i can afford. I also purchased the hatchback because I just wanted a car where the seats come down for more room to haul a picture or something large and long.
