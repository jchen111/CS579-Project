Performance, comfort, ride, the interior design and overall quality of this car is fantastic.

The BIG ISSUE to date is it's INFOTAINMENT system.  As of the writing of this review, I've had two updates to the software for the INFOTAINMENT system.  Many bugs have been fixed over the first years of frustration, but then MAZDA does something REALLY STUPID!  They grey out and disable the local search feature on the GPS as well as the ability to wifi hotspot your phone to the system to get uptodate traffic and and weather.

Basically you are now stuck with a GPS that has less features than a $100 Garmin you can buy on NOMORERACK.com  

Neither owners nor any MAZDA dealership knew this.

A great car overall for it's class.
You should definitely test drive one if you are considering a similar class car.
You'll be impressed.
