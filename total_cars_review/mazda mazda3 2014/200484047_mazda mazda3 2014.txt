New S Grand Touring purchased.  I've put on 1750 miles.

Plusses:
- Nice looking, comfortable interior (almond).
- Zoom Zoom (see below)
- keyless doors, hatch, and start button
- Adaptive Headlights
- parts of the Infotainment


Minuses:
- Fuel efficiency *far below* what's advertised:  I've averaged only 28.5mpg when driving conservatively (with hardly any air conditioning).

- Text Msg woes (see below)
- Hijacking phone's audio woes (see below)

Road feel on uneven freeway: picks up bumpiness

Road/tire noise: a bit loud on certain roads

Water hides in cracks after car washes, and comes out after driving away from car wash; creates water spots I have to remove myself.

The car is beautiful and fun to drive, but I haven't gotten near the advertised gas mileage, and that's the main reason I bought the car.
I went for a 6 cylinder SUV to this, and the average mileage isn't all that much better.
I even took it back to the dealer thinking something was wrong with the monitoring system, but they insisted it was accurate.
I am lucky to get 29 MPG on the highway.
I have also had issues with the Infotainment system - similar to those published by others in various forums - GPS system all of a sudden fails, doesn't recognize commands, fade has to be set all the way to the rear to get any sound out of the rear speakers.

Very nice car. Mazda completely reinvented the car for 2014. The interior is excellent. I opted for the almond leather with soul red exterior. Hot looking car. The 184HP is sufficient for me to zoom around town. 

Love the 7 inch display and amount of features. The car honestly feels like a 35K or higher sports coupe w/ the leather, high end details (carbon-fiber, red stitching on the leather, to sports suspension.


I also own a CX-5 and this 2.5 L engine was worth getting. Much better response and performance.

This car rocks!!! I traded in my 2010 Infiniti M35s - excellent car - but wanted something smaller, good looking, better on the gas mileage (main reason) but still spirited and responsive. I opted for the top of the line S Grand Touring hatchback with tech package that includes IELoop, LED brake lights, Bi-Xenon headlights, NAV, blink spot warning, etc...in pearl white.
Overall I am extremely impressed with the quality of materials inside and it's handling characteristics. Driver feedback is good and it grips the road extremely well. Came with 18" stock wheels.
It is just as much fun to drive than my Infiniti. The 2.5L motor is REQUIRED if you want a spirited, more aggressive experience.

Handsome. Fun. Tech. 3 words that sum up my new 3. I have had it for a week and the new car emotion hasn't subsided. 

The car simply looks good. It looks good at all angles. I have a snowflake pearl paint that looks good in the sun and somehow doesn't hide the nice lines of the fender across the body. 

I am your average commuter that doesn't necessarily have the luxury of a twisty commute but it is quite fun to steer the car. It gives me a good feel of the road.

The infotainment center is awesome. It's pretty quick to pair your phone through BT or USB. There isn't a lag time at all when connecting. The commander control has a good feel. I find myself using it than steering controls.
