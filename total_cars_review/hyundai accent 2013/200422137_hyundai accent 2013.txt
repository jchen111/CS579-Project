I spent many hours researching cars and test driving them, found this little Accent to be the most roomy, efficient new car you can buy for the money. My criteria was it had to be able to carry 2 adults and two car seats (2 kids). Zippy enough to take over the pass loaded. The trunk is roomy enough for weekend trips. I was able to get mine for $13,600 + fees for a base model. The manual transmission is very slick and the clutch is very light. Low wind noise on the freeway. Handling feels tight, but still soft over bumps.

Several years ago I swore that I would never own a Hyundai.
We are very pleased with our decision to purchase the accent.
At 10,000 miles so far, we've seen a low of 34mpg and a high of 43mpg, with 38-40mpg for our typically city driving.
It's not fast, but it's nearly hybrid like economy for tens of thousands less and much more fun to drive.
I'd have given perfect marks if it came with better tires and cruise control.
