We needed to replace an old '97 Mercury Villager, but did not want to buy a not-so mini Sienna, Odyssey, or Quest.
We researched the min-vans, cross-overs, and SUVs, and stumbled on the M5.
All the features presented looked good and its was smaller
than the Villager, which was fine because it gave better gas mileage. 

We're fine with the styling (those swoopy body curves), and I'm indifferent to the front "smiley" face.
With just under 2 months, our overall impression is that it handles well, but the ride is harsh.
The interior has lots of hard plastic. Interior space is snug, but is usable and flexible.
The ride in the 3rd bench is harsh. Gas economy on highway close to 28 mpg.
