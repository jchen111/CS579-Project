I hope anyone considering this car takes 3 minutes to read this. I traded in a 2005 honda pilot that was literally running on dollar bills for this 2013 Sportage EX on both the sticker and dealership's notion that the MPG rating was true to form in our terrain. A week into ownership I was only logging 18mpg on hwy. I called it in and they said let it break in at 5k miles. I continued to log complaints to be heard and at 5k miles on my 50 mile, 80% hwy 20% rural (Pennsylvania) commute i logged 19mpg. I did a controlled fuel test with the same result. Kia issued their mpg program but it's pennies. This is a terrible vehicle performance wise and is extremely overrated...take heed.

The vehicle did not get stated MPG. 1 week after I bought my Kia I learned Kia/Hyundai had overstated the MPG on several models and the Sportage was 1 of them. I also learned in 2002 Kia/Hyundai had a class action lawsuit against them 4 overstating horsepower on several of their vehicles which eroded my confidence in Kia. I read numerous reviews of buyers complaining their warranty was not honored so I decided all things considered Kia was not a manufacturer I felt I could trust. What good is a great warranty if a buyer cannot be sure it will be honored? Seats uncomfortable, ride bumpy, poor visibility out rear, poor mileage so I traded it in 4 a Toyota.

The Kia Sportage 2013 ex awd is a real masterpiece for the value.
What I got, for mid-20's price, is an awd vechicle with a lockable differential (not avail w/CR-V or CX-5), along with 176HP and 6 speeds (not avail w/RAV-4), along with a boatload of extras. And nice extras like: satellite radio, back-up camera, cooling glove box (for soda's), all weather mats, cargo storage cover, roof rails, on-board juke box (uvo), led lights, and much more.
And if you're worried about craftsmenship, don't - because it's got a 10year, 100,000mile drivetrain warranty.
 Add to that the mileage I get, on ave 25mpg, and the sporty feel, and nice ride - it's a winner in my book. Yeah!
