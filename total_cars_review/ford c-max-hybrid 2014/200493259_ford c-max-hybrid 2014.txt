Very happy with the car after 2200 miles and averaging 44 MPG in a mix of highway and city during my normal commute.
Think of the car as a mini-minvan - some cargo capacity (not a ton without dropping the back seat) but a solid commuter vehicle.
Will run on electric power up to about 65 MPH.
Cute efficiency monitor to train you on best MPG.
Driving over 70 will run engine all the time for lowest MPG.
Definitely shop for the base SE model - much better deal and the manual cloth seats work just fine.
I avoided the MyTouch radio and glad I did.
Replaced an Escape hybrid so I knew about driving a hybrid but no problems with learning how to keep it on electric often.

I've had the C-Max for 3 month, and it's *great*. I'm above 52 MPG in my little commutes around our generally flat Southwest town -- have not taken it on freeway or long trips. It's very comfortable for the driver and passenger (not sure about that back seat), is zippy when it needs to be, and it's nice being elevated like a mini-SUV. I don't use the Sync system except for my MP3 player which sounds good. I'm spooked by the refuse-to-start reviews...and the other day the battery was dead! I just returned from a month-long trip, so I'm hoping that's the cause...and Ford is working on the issue judging by the forum posts at fordcmaxhybridforum.com...but still!!!
