The front seats have a horrible design flaw.
The non-removable head rest tilts your neck 45 degrees forward.
After driving for several hours, I was sick with a headache.
My friend drove the next day and he got sick too.
Another person rode as a passenger and she got sick.
You won't notice the bad design in a test drive but you will notice it after about an hour.
How did such a bad design ever get approved?
So far, everyone who has spent time in the front seat of this car has become ill.

So I purchased a 2013 Dodge Avenger three months ago. I bought it because the price was great, the car looks great, and it fit what I wanted and needed in a car. The car overall is exactly as Edmunds describes it in that it does have sluggish acceleration in the 4 cylinder. It is comfortable and has some nice added features to it. The Bluetooth works great and the car is a pretty good build for what it is. Be warned the gas mileage is on the low end compared to many other cars in the same class. That is the biggest downfall for what would otherwise be a great car. So far my car has not hit its estimated MPG rating at all which was a little disappointing.
