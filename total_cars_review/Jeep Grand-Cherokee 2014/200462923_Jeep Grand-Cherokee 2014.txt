Purchased 2014 Jeep GC Limited late Oct. 2013. Vehicle built Sept. 2013.  7700 miles, and no problems. Only 1 recall item re: vanity mirror wiring in driver's sun visor.  MPG as advertised. Rides, handles & runs very well. We find it very comfortable.  Only "real" complaint is paddle shifters are too close to rim of steering wheel. Sometimes when turning wheel quickly, I will accidentally hit paddle shifter and go into manual shift mode. 

I like the GC Limited, and I see a whole lot of them out there.  Can they be as bad as some consumer reviewers say?  Not based on my experience.

Recently switched from Honda to the Jeep Grand Cherokee Ecodiesel and could not be happier.

A realistic 32 MPG HWY and 24 MPG mixed driving for a 5,300 pound 4WD vehicle is incredible.  With its maximum torque available at ~2000 RPM, acceleration from 0-35 outperforms most "sports" sedans...which makes it imminently drivable around town.  Sport mode is essential for spirited driving; Eco mode is docile and delivers best fuel economy (~24 MPG City).

The interior is very comfortable, and of high quality.  I love the open pore wood trim.

Only 1 problem to date (DEF injector), which was fixed quickly by the dealer.  No other issues!

This is my 3rd Jeep Grand Cherokee, and by far my least favorite. 

Every feature in this car has been thought out (excuse me - not thought out) to be for driver safety and passenger comfort.
1)  I love that quick automatic turn signal  that only blinks 3 times.  Works so poorly in heavy traffic.  Its a great feature when you drive put a turn signal on and when finishing changing lanes the signal flashes as though you are turning back to thee lane you came from.
2) I always love a car that lurches when starting to move forward.
3) I have driven rear wheel drive cars that handle snow better than my 4x4 Jeep.

I've had 6 new JGC & have watched them improve in style & quality every year. I traded in my 2011 for a 2014 & found the quality of the 2011 superior to the 2014. The price now same as Audi/Lexi/BMW. The electronic transmission shift isn't user friendly, it clunks into gear & is difficult to move into position, the letters in the dr's dash window showing NSE&W sometimes match the gear letters & it can be too much computer info when you're driving. The 2011 hatch door had 2-opening choices, full hatch or top half window. The 2014 cheapened their costs eliminating the top window.
I just want to say goodby Jeep Grand Cherokee I'll drive it for a year and go elsewhere next year.

The car is very nice to drive but this is what we've been dealing with so far and it has only been 8K miles
Random error messages about network error.
Last door to be closed has to be slammed shut.
Navigation thinks it is a block left or right from current location.
Cruise control randomly shuts off.
Buttons on steering wheel and on the control cluster getting stuck and locking down everything else.
Voice control absolutely horrible.

This is just a fraction of what we have been going through

I read some of the complaints but a few friends have the truck for a while with no issues at all.
Firstly, you can not beat the deals Jeep is giving on these trucks. The value for the money is unreal.
I love the U Connect interface. It is by far easier to use than BMW I-Drive, Audi MMI, or Lexus.
Have an Audi and had the others.
The features are terrific, intuitive, and easy to use. Heated seats front, rear, and steering wheel.
I got the 20" wheels and the ride is firm and comfortable. The steering is precise.
The transmission is the same 8sp electronic that
BMW uses. It has 3 drive modes. No electronic, HVAC, or transmission issues at all..

Well I went from foreign to American after 20 years with some good and bad news here for you all.
Make sure you do your research and test things with this Jeep.
List of my bads:
1. HVAC is horrible watch my video here.
Tons of folks complaining about this horrible system!
OK this site won't let you post links, go to youtube and search for 2014 jeep grand cherokee hvac issues, mine has a thermometer on the screen.
Google-jeep garage heat issues to read all the complaints on that forum
2. Trans in eco sucks, only way to get close to sticker MPG, otherwise getting 20 on the highway out of eco.

I had rented the JGC for two days earlier in a business trip. The rental totally changed my perception of the Jeep brand. The drive was smooth and the internal furnishing and electronics are as good as my other car, which was BMW Z4. At the conclusion of the rental, the truck was rear-ended by a Toyota Camry. The Camry's hood was badly damages, but the JGC has only a very slight impression of Toyota's emblem on its plastic bumper (the rented JGC has no tow hitch). When my wife said she wanted an SUV, that became my first choice. We tested a couple others, but both decided on the JGC.
It has only been a couple days, but had been extremely happy with it. Everything comes as expected.

I left a review this summer only 30 days into the purchase of my '14 JGC Ltd. and reported that I was having multiple problems mainly with the U-Connect system. I'm now reporting back 7 months later into owning this complete hunk of monkey crap which has now been in the Dealer's shop 6X for U-Connect and other "electronic issues/failures". Chryser is so tired of hearing from me that they decided to rip out my Jeep's U-Connect and replace it with a brand new one. They told me "this would fix everything". Continued problems I am facing include HVAC malfunction, no heat, airbag failure, U-Connect black screen, seat belt malfunction, Phone, Radio, Navi malfunction, the list goes on and on and on

This vehicle has great potential.
This Jeep could be great and has many likeable and commendable attributes.
This Jeep has two issues; one rather substantial.
The Audio/Nav system is basically the electronic brains of the vehicle and it has bugs, lots of bugs.
The bigger issue is the transmission, it is awful.
Perhaps it's not widespread (I hope it's not) and it's just my particular jeep but I have never driven a more balky transmission.
It lurches, it has delays, it feels like their is a disconnect between the pedal and acceleration.
In summary it is the opposite of smooth :(
If it is fixable, I'll be overjoyed...If not, extremely disappointed.
