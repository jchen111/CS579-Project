I've had this vehicle for about a month, scoring on excellent president day sales. My first Subaru. Very solid feel to this car. Engine/CVT still breaking in but performing nicely. Excellent gas mileage-up to 33MPG highway. Combined around 27mpg. Handles well on dry and wet pavements even with the crappy Bridgestone tires it came with. Haven't driven in the snow yet, but I expect it will really shine then. The ride is firm but a bit choppy. Road noise is present but well within acceptable limits. The driver's seat and position is stellar, as is the visability. The "upgraded" six speaker stereo is fair at best. Overall, a reliable car that does most everything well with AWD standard!

Have been enjoying this car for over 7 months (about 8000 miles). I share it with my wife. Some of the negative reviews I've read may be by people that don't own this car or think they own it. Subaru hit a home run with this model and I started driving their cars in 1978. Their engineering prowess is put to the test here and they did almost everything right. The handling, power, transmission, fun factor, stereo, blue tooth, visibility, seating, comfort, all blend into a symphony of joy. It looks good and awd will get you through the worst weather with confidence. Mileage has been very good. 25 city, 31 (or more) highway. People with crappy mileage are lead footed.

After owning Audi's I am more than a little surprised.
Build quality (ie. timing chain vs. belt) is very solid, it is understandable why Subaru's push the mileage limits.
CVT trans offers a low hum in city driving but have been told that this will disappear around the 5K mark

I chose this car because when I bought it I lived in a city with harsh winters and I needed a reliable, AWD option. I researched for over a year and decided to go with the Legacy over an SUV because of the gas mileage and the reliability of the Subaru name.
The size of the cabin is great, and I can fit 4 large adults in here comfortably. The biggest problem I have had with this car is the gas mileage. At this point, I have driven it 4200 miles and have had an oil change and am still not getting above 21.9 miles to the gallon. I drive the freeway to work everyday and should be getting at least 28 combined. Even on a highway trip of 1200 miles, the best mileage I got was 29 MPG.

I bought this to replace my wife's aging Toyota Corolla.
We wanted something with AWD that was more roomy than her old car and still got above 30mpg highway.
On paper, the Subaru fit the bill perfectly.
With the updates to the transmission, engine, and chassis for 2013, I was much more impressed than with the 2012 and older models as far as throttle response, steering, and overall feel of the car.
It was an easy decision to get the added room and 30+ hp over the newly redesigned Impreza.

...and the Legacy came out on top for my family and me. I drive about 40 miles round-trip for work each day and have a two month old son. My wife and I traded in an older SUV and wanted a midsize sedan that would comfortably hold a rear-facing car seat while also achieving high MPG on the highway. High safety scores were also very important to us, and the Legacy delivered on all fronts. I drove several competing sedans but settled on the Legacy because of its spacious cabin and AWD. I've had the car for a couple weeks and love driving it. I was very close to buying a 2012 Fusion but didn't quite feel right. The Camry didn't feel right, either. Both cars pale in comparison to the Legacy.

I just got it so this will be a preliminary review. So far I'm very impressed with this "freshened up" model. Very attractive vehicle, quiet interior, good power. Have only driven one day but am fairly car savvy and know about Subaru since it's earlier days. They keep improving on a good thing and don't cheapen their cars like other companies to save money. I saw the car in April at the NY auto show. One of my old cars was up for inspection and I decided to trade in for this puppy. So far, I love it.
