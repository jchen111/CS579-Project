R/T base with the 6spd manual, Sound Group II stereo, HID headlights, and a sunroof.
This thing is quick.
So far, I've seen an avg. of 4.85 seconds on the 0-60 timer in the info center.
The transmission shifts smooth and precise, excellent for stock.
Love the pistol grip.
The torque curve is as flat as Montana, and twice as big.
This thing sounds amazing for a stock exhaust, nice growl under acceleration, but barely audible at highway speeds.
Excellent ride quality, and it's library quiet at 70 mph.
HID headlights are amazing, both low & high beams.
The stereo is also excellent, plenty of bass.
Never seen less than 19 mpg, and a peak of 23 so far.

Dealer options: Blacktop Package

This car totally changes its character with the Super Track Pak (STP). Reviews peg the manual RT as the fat girl of the muscle car bunch. But with the suspension and steering upgrades the Challenger elevates to porn-star like proportions. And it's just as much fun to drive.

I was a Japanese import fanboy for +10 years and fantasized about buying a BRZ. However just one test drive in the Dodge changed my mind. Power is sexy, and the RT moves just as well as it looks. Buying a 150ft-lb BRZ over this 410ft-lb beauty would be a mistake; and for the same price!

This car had the shifttronic auto :(, but still allowed full rev to each gear and downshifting. Did a 0-60 test, yielded 5.5 with some wheelspin, not bad. Seemingly very powerful. Throws you back when you gas in almost every gear. Passing on the highway is great dropped to third. Very fun car to drive. Fantastic stereo system and Sirius radio. Lots of trunk space. Back seats are actually quite comfortable for me at 6'. Projector beam HID lights for night driving seem adequate. Leather is nice and not too plush for easier care then some competitive Euros like my personal VR6.

Last year I had difficulty in deciding whether to buy a Charger or Challenger. I bought the Charger and liked the Dodge product so much that this year I bought a Challenger. Both are RT's. The Charger was a better value but the Challenger is a great car. 
A lot of people want to compare the Challenger to the Camaro and Mustang. This is a huge mistake. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. For pure speed and handling the Challenger will never compete with the Camaro or Mustang. For comfort, room and road presence the Camaro and Mustang are not in the same class as the Challenger.I like all three cars and I am not brand loyal at all. I bought an RT Plus in Granite Metallic, just Beautiful
