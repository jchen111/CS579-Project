I love my 2013 VW Tiguan S.
It's build with quality, and great design on both the exterior and interior. With the manuel 6 speed transmission, the pick up and handling are excellent, which makes having to use premium gas much less painful. The engine is extremely quite and very responsive.

Cargo room could be a bit more generous. 

Overall a great vehicle!
