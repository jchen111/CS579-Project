I am a faithful VW driver, 4 vehicles over the last 13 years. You either love em or hate em! I buy Volkswagons for German styling, fit and finish, and enjoyable driving experience. They fit a pricing niche above Toyotas and Hondas and below Audi and BMW.The Tiguan is a typical example of a stylish, functional and truly enjoyable vehicle. Among the reasons to enjoy a Tiguan, is not being one of every ten cars on the road being a CRV or a Rav4.
