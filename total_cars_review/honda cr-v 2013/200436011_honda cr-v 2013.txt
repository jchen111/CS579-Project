Generally pleased with latest incarnation of the CRV but has anyone come across the problem of a light rattling sound from the rear of the vehicle.
After a couple of dealership trips (car under warranty) it turns out to be a couple of pebbles that have bounced into the shock absorber recesses at the rear.
The only way to remove them was to use a pressure air blower. The dealer did this free the first time but I was charged when it happened again.
The older version CRV did not have this problem.
Also, the sound system is not as bassy as the old version.
Not that it matters much to me but it's not as good as the sound system in the older CRV.

Compared with my previous vehicle, a 2004 Honda CR-V, the 2013 is VERY disappointing in all aspects EXCEPT fuel economy.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We researched vehicles for years and after buying a used 1998 Honda Odyssey and being so impressed by how everything still worked well and was built so well, (unlike our GM vehicles, where everything breaks, ac vents, windows don't work, etc.), we decided we wanted some of that Honda reliability! We wanted a CRV so it would be easier to slip in & out of & still have room for people and my husbands drums when he plays with bands.
It accomodates everything and very well! I often look into other suvs in parking lots to see if they have as much room inside as our CRV and they never do, esp. in back. Other owners of CRVs up to 10 yrs old tell me they love it, no problems ever! It's a joy to own!

First we test drove just about every SUV made and kept notes on accessories and price of each one. I never gave them my name just took their business card.Also noted if the sales guy was high pressure. Our choice was narrowed by comfort, style, accessories and cost. When it came down to it
the Honda was by far the best deal. Everytime I changed from cloth to leather and back or navigation no navigation, AutoNation Lewisville had lots of choices.
Our sales guy Jim Ross gave us the grand tour of the vehicle before our test drive. There was no pressure, we asked him questions and he let us talk through the differences.

Well after much research I took the plunge.
The water was filled with disappointment.
The dealer could not program the hands free phone, delivered the car dirty and not serviced, and tried to sell all kinds of useless add-ons.
Not what I remembered from my last Honda.
The innovation is just not there.

Now for all of you poor souls who looked and looked for the wiper indicator its not there.
Honda America has some kind dip stick to let you know if wiper fluid is low.
Won't find out until you are in a dangerous situation and no way to clear your windsheild.
The car was delivered with an empty tank.

Watch out for tranmission surge while in Econ Mode.
