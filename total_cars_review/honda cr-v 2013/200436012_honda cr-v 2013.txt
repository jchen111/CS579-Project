All around an excellent SUV, so roomy, I mean this thing has more room than a BMW X5.
Honda utilitarian value, smart design, simple yet extremely practical , had one issue with a TSB on the Actuator, but that's it.
I have a 2012 EX CRV with 22,000 miles, love it.
very good on fuel, can carry 2 sets of golf clubs, 4 suitcases and 2 bikes on the back and still get excellent mileage.
Luv this SUV.
not the fanciest of SUV, but top marks for reliability and economical, utilitarian value!
AWD Systems works great in the snow and very safe vehicle

I bought the 2013 CR-V because of how much I like my 2010 Odyssey. There is absolutely no comparison because the CR-V is so inferior to the Odyssey (sadly).
Problems:
1. Full Beam Headlights are hopeless. The area in the immediate front of the car and at the sides is far too dark. It's almost as if the headlights point straight ahead and are elevated. It's a road hazard driving at night in the country where there are no city lights. Honda dealer replaced bulbs but no difference. Honda and Dealer simply deny there is a problem.
2. Car temperature inside is unbearable when temp drops below 20 degrees F.

Nice automobile, but for an EX-L it is a bare bones equipment. Put 5500 miles on so far. Acceleration has gotten better, mileage good but the seats are awful. I have never had such a sore behind in my life. My wife and I are of small build and the seat is firm right in the middle where your tailbone rides. My tailbone feels like its on fire in just ten minutes of driving, hers too, either seat. Its going to the upholstery shop soon. If he can't fix it then it will be sold. Who designed those seats. They must be like the accord seats everybody complains about. Called Honda, they don't seem interested in helping me out, see the dealer.

CRV EX-L. It has heated leather seats. We've had hondas, Accords and Odyssey, before, which were very good vehicles: reliable, great value, good performance, comfortable, etc., so thought this would be a good choice.

Issues: headlights, tranny, radio, info screen.
Seems as though part of the headlights are blocked, and even more so with with the high-beams on.
Tranny: test drive seemed very smooth, but later noticed that when decelerating then give it gas there is good amount of delay in the acceleration. Can't you go with 6 speed?
Radio: Really? lower grad than what I had in my 1995 Accord. Why put that in top-end model.
Info screen: was this project complete?

I haven't bought a new car in years and I did a ton of research to find the best little SUV that would last and be the most reliable.
All of my research pointed to the Honda CRV over and over again.
I did drive a Rav 4 and it felt cheap and rattly even though it was new and had the highest trim.
I planned to drive the Mazda CX5 but once I drove the CRV I did not feel it was necessary.
I also considered the Ford Escape because it is awesome looking but reliability on Ford does not even come close to Honda.
The interior of the CRV is very handsome and makes me feel like I am driving a european import.
I considered the cloth interior but once I saw the leather I fell in love with it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like the car but had to go back to the stealership because the spare tire cover over the iner well is warped after 1
month. It happened in the summer, I think it is the humidity. They gave me a new cover no problem but it's the same thing another month later. So, it's back to the stealership again.

Shopped around for a couple of months before deciding to purchase a new Honda Suv My previous one had horribly uncomfortable seats.
That was 8 Years ago.
Have only had this one two days; so far no complaints on comfort.
Overall great looking; good fuel economy, love the technology.
Very roomy.
Good visibility.
My only concern at this point is road noise.
I would classify it as excessive.
I've had a Ford Expedition and a Honda Pilot; both were 4-wheel drive and much less road noise.
I'm going to try my carpeted floor mats to see if that helps otherwise the car may be going back to the dealer on day number three.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've had the CR-V for about 5 months & ever since the car was delivered it has vibrated between 1800 & 2200 RPM.
It is most noticeable between 55 & 65 MPH.
At low speeds there is no vibration, but once the transmission shifts into high, then the car rumbles.
I've brought it back to the dealer 3 times, & they acknowledge the problem & say that it is charachteristic of the CR-V.
One of the service team leaders said the problem is also on the Accord 4 cylinder. It just appears that the transmission shifts too soon.
It's really frustrating.
Don't be in the passing lane if you're in Econ mode & accellerating up a hill! The non-highway mileage averages around 24 mpg.

My wife steered me towards this vehicle to replace a Town and Country which was getting long in the tooth.
I balked at the SUV thing for a long time and now realize I may have been in error thinking this way.
I needed a vehicle that would tow a light utility trailer and get reasonable gas mileage.

Just got back from a trip to Florida from mid Missouri.
Best mileage was 31 on the highway, worst was 27 in town driving.
Comfortable at highway speeds, nimble and responsive when a truck came into our lane without warning.
Purchased without waiting for the new RAV 4 to become available and not sorry (we have a Camry so I am not anti-Toyota).
Glad Honda builds this.

After driving many different small suvs, the Honda won me over. Dollar for dollar it was the best out there. The exl comes well equipped including blue tooth, back up camera, leather interior. fog lights, sun roof, climate control, just to mention a few. I had owned a 2008 crv and really liked that. This new body style keeps all the good points of the old one but addresses the road noise issues and adds a more compliant ride. The 4 cylinder engine has more than adequate power and the 5 speed automatic transmission is as smooth as silk. Great on gas too.
