I purchased my Rogue in June of 2013. So far, it has proven to be a reliable, comfortable, and fun to drive vehicle. I test drove The Jeep Patriot, Toyota Rav-4, and Ford Escape, before choosing the Rogue. The Rav-4 and Escape were nice, but were pricey. As for the Patriot; no comment smh. The Rogue's smooth ride, decent acceleration, nice handling, and fair asking price were what sold me. The CVT does take some getting use to, but it serves it purpose. MPG ranges between 23.5 and 26.7. Only issue I have is I wish it was just a bit larger. The cargo space is modest but I knew that when I bought it. Overall it's a good vehicle, although I think a Tucson or Sportage gives more bang for buck.
