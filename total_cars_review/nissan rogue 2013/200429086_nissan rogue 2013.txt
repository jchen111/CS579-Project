I am 28 and this is the 19th new car I have owned.
I have had everything from a 2 seater smart car to a crew cab full size pick up truck with cars from basic to luxury fully loaded. My 18th new car was a fully loaded 2010 Nissan Cube which was a GREAT car and has made me a loyal Nissan owner now. The price to maintane the vehicle is cheaper then its other Japanese competitors. This little SUV has enough pep to keep you happy with the great fuel economy that is truely hard to achieve in this class of vehicle. I have the FWD SV with premium package. I test drove this in 12" of unplowed parking lot snow and it plowed right through it!
