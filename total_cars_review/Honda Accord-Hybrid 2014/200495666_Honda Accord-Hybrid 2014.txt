I now have 8,000 miles on my Accord Hybrid.  The mileage claims are extremely optimistic.  I live in Wisconsin and in cold weather you will be lucky to get 30 MPG in city driving.  In the summer on highway driving you can get into the middle 40's MPG.  I have never seen 50 MPG and my Accord is always in the eco-mode.  It has also left me stranded once in the winter as it would not start due to the cold.  I am also having issues with the paint chipping.  This was no surprise as the paint quality on Hondas has gone down a lot in recent years.  Overall it is not worth the extra money over a regular Acord.

I've put nearly 10,000 miles on my Accord Hybrid so far. I've averaged about 46 MPG with many of those miles coming over the recent cold winter. Using the heat can really take a hit especially on shorter trips.

In the summer months I've averaged 60-65 MPG in town. On several road trips I've averaged right around 45 MPG.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am happy for what I picked especially the mpg about average over 44 mpg for my first tank of gas. 
 For all Accord hybrid: Please pay attention to your rear windshield, Have you see any object or image of waviness, curving around like you are in a steamy hot desert???? My Honda service manager, advisor all seems happen only on Hybrid. Honda won't do nothing if you all don't complaint it. I can't see ant straight line behind me!!!!!

I've had my hybrid Ex-L for about a month now. I regularly get around 53 mpg city, but my highway mpg runs around 37 even with the econ button on (I have a bit of a lead foot). The mpg is effected more in cold weather than traditional cars. I love how I can put it in electric mode for short trips if the battery is charged enough, its perfect for running to the grocery store. Like another reviewer mentioned, the battery rarely gets fully charged, but does well enough.
It doesn't drive like the traditional hybrid (no hesitation) unless you put it in econ mode.

This is the 3rd Honda Accord I have purchased. A 01 EX-L V6, 08 EX-L V6 Navi and now this EX-L Hybrid.
When looking for a new vehicle I wanted something reliable and luxurious.
While shopping for a new car my son told me that this new Hybrid was launching and that it got great mileage, which in my daily commute would be great.
I test drove the car, and it was Quiet and Smooth. I was sold, I purchased the car right away because I knew this was a winner. I have now had the car since about November 7th and I can say that it does get 50 MPG and I don't miss the Navigation because when I bought my 08 and the end of 07, the iPhone had just come out, fast forward to 2014, the iPhone is a GPS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will have had my Accord Hybrid EX-L four weeks tomorrow. I was expecting to buy a Fusion Hybrid last year, but by the time I was able to test drive one in January, reports of mileage far below the EPA ratings were coming out, so I decided to wait for the new Accord Hybrid. I was able to test drive one within a week of release; as soon as I drove it, I knew it was the car I wanted. I had been driving an Acura TL for 9+ years, so the Accord felt somewhat familiar to me. I have not been disappointed in my decision. The car is very nicely finished, handles well, and acceleration is better than expected. The seats are quite comfortable. We have averaged about 48 mpg driving locally.

I love this car! I had the 2010 accord leased and bought the new hybrid it's sleek style and economical gas mileage is my fav features.
The power it has at take off it's like if it were a v6 engine.
I would never think its that powerful and I thought I would lose power for fuel economy but I was wrong this car has more power than the 2010 Honda.
Love it! Thanks honda for an even better car!
