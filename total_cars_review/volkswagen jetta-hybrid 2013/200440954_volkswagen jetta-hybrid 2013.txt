As a current TDI owner I've enjoyed great performance and economy.
I was skeptical of the hybrid, but I have been surprised to be getting better than EPA estimates for mpg, usually mid 40s to low 50s.
The car does not need to be driven slow, but you need to maximize the time the car is driving under battery power or sailing.
The power meter helps a lot with this.
Aggressive driving will lower mpg considerably.
The road feel is great and the DSG is very smooth.
The 1.4L TSI is very torquey and the car feels quick.
I have the SEL which is nicely equipped.
I think the hybrids compliment the TDIs nicely.
The hybrid is ideal for those driving around town and on crowded highways.

I'm 3000 miles on the premium model (no xenon fender or camera) but still quite nice. Gets 45 mpg if you drive 60-65 also nice is that in traffic (where can't accelerate too much) you'll still get 40 mpg or so. Drive like a sports car though -- 35ish. But, moreso, I've been driving hybrids since 2003 and love how this car handles, accelerates and has comfortable drive. VW did really well this car. Quiet ride to boot. I know people will say the "diesel" gives you more bang for your buck...BUT DIESEL IS NOT AS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AS UNLEADED, even "clean" diesel" -- it's just cleaner than previous diesel. This one gets ZERO emissions about 25% and can be more. Much better epa.gov ratings.
