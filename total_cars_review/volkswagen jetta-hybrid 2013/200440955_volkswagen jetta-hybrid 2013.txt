brought my 2009 jetta into the dealer to resolve a problem , and while waiting browsed the show room and met a used dealer jetta hybrid on display , went for a demo drive and bought the demo 2013 jetta hybrid SEL . although the 2009 jetta is a great car to drive with plenty of torque , the hybrid is quieter , smother with a bunch of bells and whistles . and drives like a cloud , compared to the tdi jetta , and gets 49 -50 MPG. average for a month worth of driving averaged 47 MPG. although having to use premium gasoline (that is cheaper than diesel) the MPG is a little better than the TDI . of all the vehicles I have had over the many years the TDI was the most fun to drive. hybrid +

Our Jetta Hybrid will be a year old next month, my wife's the primary driver and she loves it, but, I LOVE it more, and enjoy driving it so much whenever she "lets me"...!!!
don't be fooled by the fact this is a "hybrid", VW has "done it right" with great handling, performance and fuel economy (that cold be BETTER..more details below...) for a car that we are happy to own and have NO regrets in buying.
Our 16 yo daughter "can't wait" to get her hands on it when she starts to drive..."in her dreams"....!!!

Despite the elevated cost of the SEL Premium version, I needed a commuter car with excellent mpg specs, and being a VW fan, was drawn to the Jetta Hybrid.
Previously I'd owned a 2011 GTi, but didn't care for the 28mpg part of ownership (but a blast to drive, for sure).
Having driven several Prius vehicles, I learned to dislike the golf-cart like CVT, so the 7 speed DSG of the Jetta Hybrid was a huge plus.
I love this car so far, and 46 mpg is my mileage after two tanks of (premium) fuel.
Build quality seems a notch above a base Jetta. The Fender audio is as good as anything a manufacturer has ever put into a car, IMHO. Thank you VW for an alternative to TDI!
