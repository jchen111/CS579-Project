I just purchased the gas model Passat 2.5 SE and have been very delighted with the car. highway mileage has ranged from 36.5 to 39.7 based on travel. Trunk storage is amazing. The seating is comfortable and extremely roomy. I do agree that the stock tires are a bit noisy, but that has nothing to do with the high quality of the car and i would highly recommend this car to anyone.

This is the fifth VW I've owned and while not the most exciting, it is the highest quality!
Smooth and comfortable, and very roomy.
Back seat passengers are amazed.
A terrific highway cruiser - every VW I've owned is as stable and smooth at 95mph as most cars are at 65.
The 2.5 engine gets a bad rap, as it's more economical in real life than many of the newer turbo engines.
I'm seeing 25 avg in around town driving, and 31 on a high speed trip through Texas.
I shopped against a Fusion 1.6T and was certain the Ford would be my choice, but the quality of the VW shone through.
I'm very satisfied with my choice.

We are a middle class family who searched for mid-size sedan that would be roomy enough for my 6 foot 3 husband, myself and two kids.
we have been driving an SUV but i was getting tired of paying so much for gas.
I wanted a luxury feel but at a middle class income price.
This was the car that fit all those needs.
It's huge.
It's actually longer and wider then my Ford Edge.
The kids and husband have a ton of room.
It's really nice to drive, it has that cozy sports feel drive to it.
It grips the road like a glove.
I love all the techie touches.
The stereo system is great with the touch and blue tooth and all the information if gives you on the dash! This car is great.

Toyota convert and love the fun, features, and value this car brings. Feels like a really high end vehicle. Well planned interior, smooth and quiet ride. Great value for the SE package.
