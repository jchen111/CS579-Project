I like this car but do not love it. It is smooth, has well thought out controls, is spacious, looks good, and drives well but i'm not sure if it is still the pick of the class. The big let down is the five cylinder power train. The mileage isn't great, the engine isn't as smooth as the Honda four i've come from, the power output is poor for something with five cylinders, and the transmission is slow to shift. No verdict yet on reliability. The car feels well made but VW cars have not always lasted. Only time will tell.
