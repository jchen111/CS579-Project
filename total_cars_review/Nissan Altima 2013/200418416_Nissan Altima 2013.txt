Car seemed like a good value with a good mix of features vs. price when purchased.
However, ran into many problems in the first 7,500 miles.
There was noise coming from the passanger tires. Constant rattling from the center cosole where the CS player is located.
It was made of very cheap plastic and would get louder in hot weather. The sunroof would rattle.
Had it replaced once but turned out to be the frame of the car above the driver's head that shook loose from car body. Probably a bit dangerous when I think back. I found the seats to be extremely uncomfortable and had back and leg pain.
Replaced with Honda Accord and there is a huge quality difference! no problems after 10K miles

 I've a 2013 Nissan SV which is a great vehicle and i love it. I wasn't a fan of Nissan vehicle but the new design gave me a push in buying it and also giving it a surprise gift to my lovely mom.
 The vehicle is fun to drive, with its great interior features and liability. Everything is top of class for its own level compared to other vehicle such as Honda, Toyota.
 Despite that, i think a few things needs to be made such as the Brake Light System & Air Bag System.
 The Air Bag System is finally fixed & i'm glad the dealership saw that i wasn't creating stuff up. Next fixing should be the Brake Light System because I've changed my Nissan 3 times.
 Other than that, vehicle is Awesome.

Whole car vibrates/shakes at 1900RPM. I have replaced alternator & belt in regard to this issue but nothing has happened. Car still vibrates. Nissan technician told me it is normal because of CVT. well you didnot tell me that when I was purchasing the car. This is a major issue and NIssan is not even considering it as a problem. They do not have a solution fir it yet. I strongly advise all the potential customers to stay away from this car until they resolve the issue.

I know better than to buy the first model year of a complete redesign... Immediately after purchase I had the windshield trim replaced because it would not hold secure and was flapping at highway speeds. Then with about 2K miles on it the car left me stranded at Wal-Mart. Nissan roadside took two hours to get a tow truck to me. Turns out it was a known ignition system recall that the dealer failed to update before I purchased the car. The radio has been replaced already for having issues such as dropping the blue tooth link with any connected phone, flashing on and off and so on. It took 3 weeks to get a replacement radio in. Dash trim on the side of the radio has been replaced...........

After 7 months and 9700 miles, I still love it, it's great car and I'm very happy with it. Fantastic gas mileage 30 to 32 mpg combined city and hwy 38 to 39 in all hwy. This is my fourth Altima and the best one yet. Love the new style, quality and it is alot more refined over previous models it's very quite and I love the upscale trim and smooth ride. The handling is great and I love it for long drives. I gets lots of compliments on the car and it style. It's very Infiniti like in the styling and I'm not complaining about that. I had read about the issues the early models had so I waited and made sure I bought one produced later in the year, Mine was made in July '13 and I'm glad I did!!!

I bought a 2.5 SV in October 2012 and issues began within a few days of purchase.
The car is comfortable and responsive for a 4 cylinder.
The first 2 issues were a vibration when the engine was under a load and the other was some electrical issues.
The driver side door lock would actuate repeatedly without my doing anything and the window would go half way down or up then return any time I pressed the button.
The passenger side air bag warning light stayed on much of the time.
After 18 months and 27,000 miles, the electrical issues persisted, the alternator went out and so did the transmission.
I replaced it with a 2013 3.5 SL and within a week the transmission started acting up.

Love my purchase! Aesthetically pleasing interior for the price, exceeding expectations. The instrument panel is easy to read and the layout is relaxed and comfortable. Because of the remote starter, I'm okay without heated/cooled seats. The 7 in monitor/navigation screen is pretty awesome and so is the zero-gravity seating. It's all really cool, including the performance. In fact, my sedan actially drives better (to me) than the 2012 and 2013 coupe version, which I drove exclusively the last two years.

Bought the car 3 months ago...nice car but very disappointed with the mileage.
I am getting a solid 27 mpg with about half of my driving being freeway.

 Very nice car ,well built ,looks and rides
great 
Considered a Honda Accord ,but the Altima was a better car . 4 Cylinder motor has plenty of power

2013 Altima SV- Smooth ride, averaging 30 mpg overall, steering better than many other sedans, no problem with wandering, maintains a straight line well, engine is smooth with no shuddering, much less noisy engine than earlier Altimas, comfortable seats, controls are easy to operate, excellence all around.
