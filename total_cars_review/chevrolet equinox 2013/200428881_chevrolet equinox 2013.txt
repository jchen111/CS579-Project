I do love driving my Equinox for the most part except when it comes time to refuel.
They have changed the nozzel connection to the actual pump and I find myself stressing about the connection from the pump to the nozzel, they do not catch therefore the pump continues to shut down.
I actually hate refueling!
I asked the dealer what was with that and its just a new change.
The first time I needed gasoline I had to push the nozzel in tight for the duration for it kept popping out and shutting off!!
I also don't necessarily like the new park break option, you push down on the park break and it sets, you push down again and it releases.
I miss my release the park break lever.

Overall good car. 2 things I think need improvement. One is the front seat construction. The plastic side piece comes way up the cushion so that when I get out it squishes my thigh and hurts unless I snake sideways and slip out of the car, but that gives me a panty wedgy every time. Secondly and most important is the vibrating rear view mirror. They have replaced the mirror but to no avail. After driving 2 more new cars on the lot we discovered the same issue. Must be a poor design. Bad. It actually deters me from looking in my rear as often as I'd like.

I
just got my New 2013 equinox 2.4 LS. I just don't see anything to complain about in this car!. On the test drive I did notice the transmission down shifting, but so what? that is what the transmission does.
I am impressed with the power for a 4 cylinder engine in this car.
As for gas milage it is pretty much same as my old Geo tracker, but this car has more style,
more room, more power and fun to drive. This is the best purchase I made for the price I spent, and I did look and drive few other vehicles before chooosing and buying this car.

This is a 4-cyl, 6-spd, front wheel drive. Owned for 8 months, have put 15,500 miles on it. I've been stranded twice due to break-downs, both times requiring a tow back to the dealer. The transmission has major problems, leads to the starter shorted and burned off, and fit and finish is so poor that road dust gathers in the cabin.

The front wheel drive is fine on dry roads as long as you keep the traction control on. On wet or icy roads, the vehicle is down right dangerous. Without the traction control you slide all over the place, with the traction control the anti-spin engages and the vehicle will not move. All-wheel drive is obviously a most with this SUV.
