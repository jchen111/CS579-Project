I purchased a 2013 Chevy Equinox new in February 2013. If you wash the car at home in your driveway everything is fine, but it starts snowing and you try to take it through a car wash, the sun roof leaks and you get all wet. I have taken it back twice to the dealer and talked to GM, both say that is the way the car is made, all 2012 and 2013 Equinox sun roofs leak when you take them through a car wash. My recommendation if you live where you have bad weather and take your car through a car wash, don't get a sun roof or buy something else.

I hate how the steering wheel covers up the ac vents, could have designed it better.
I have a 2013 with 13k miles, the black granite color. I have had to take it in once already because the paint has bubbled and now IÂm taking it in again for the same paint bubbles, just in a different location. My equinox is a 4cy and I only get, at most 25 mpg and the dealer cannot explain why, I drive on open road, not much stop and go traffic. Just recently my brakes have started making a horrible sound. I have had to take it in multiple times for the electronics, all to do with the radio / navigation. I really liked the design of the car, for the most part.

I have had this 2013 Equinox for about one month and I am very happy with it. It has a nice quiet ride, I love the stereo system, love the sunroof. In fact I love everything about it. We are taking it on a 300 mile road trip this next weekend and I am confident of a good ride and great performance.
If there is one thing I would have any negative comment about, it would be the gas cap to fill it up with gas is on the passenger side! Other than that, I am very pleased with my new car. We are recently retired and this will probably be our last new car.

I am extremely happy with the 2013 Equinox LTZ with the 3.6L. The style and comfort are great. Ours has all the bells and whistles on it and it is pure fun to drive. Lots of power. The power lift gate and sun roof are a real kick. The seats are powered and adjust easily and comfortably. We have the memory adjust on our Equinox and when i or my wife drive it, it's so easy to push a button and the seat and mirrors adjust to our settings. The size is perfect for the two of us. Plenty of room in the back for guests and the rear seat is adjustable. Enough cargo space in the back for us for luggage or groceries and with the back seats down plenty of room for hauling all sorts of things.

 I purchased a 2013 Equinox LTZ with the 3.6L
V-6 eingine. I am very impressed with the quality materials and refinement of the interior, the overall
fit and finish, and the performance of the V-6.
It is very comfortable, has lots of leg room, and is very quiet. If you are considerig a midsize SUV, you should test drive one.
I bet you will be impressed with the quality, performance and comfort. I drove several other brands and they all felt cramped and inferior to the Equinox.
This is
by far the best quality mid-sized SUV I have found.
I average 20MPG driving mostly around town and 23-24 MPG on the highway. I like everything about the equinox and highly recommend it.

Just picked up my 2013 Equinox LTZ and so far am loving it.
I've had many different cars from Chevy to BMW to Nissan to Audi and the features for the price this one definitely provides that bang for the buck.
The only additional option I got on the LTZ was new 3.6L V6 engine and it provides enough get up and go for a vehicle of this size.
Too new to really gauge gas mileage but that isn't one of my main concerns really.
The fit and finish of the interior is great for it's class.
I opted for the two-tone Light Titanium/Black interior and it goes really well.
Love the touch screen radio.
Got mine for under invoice and it definitely can't be beat in this segment for that price!
