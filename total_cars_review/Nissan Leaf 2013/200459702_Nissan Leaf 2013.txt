I absolute love driving the 2013 Nissan Leaf S model that we have leased.
 It reminds me of the driving dynamics of the Mini Cooper that we used to own.
The biggest problem is that I tend to drive about 15 miles above the speed limit with the Leaf because it's so quiet and smooth.
One thing that I'd wish for is better/smoother braking when regenerative braking is being applied. Another is better location of some of the control buttons on the left side of the steering wheel.
The majority of these buttons are not illuminated and are hidden by the steering wheel.

Had the car for 1300 miles and 1 month. Great car. Purchased after I got tired of waiting for the new Smart ED which had repeated delays.

We got the base S model with the $1300 DC Fast Charge option.
SL, SV models come with the 6.6KW onboard charger that charges your car at about 30% per hour.
The old 3.3KW charger (still standard on the S) gives you about half that charging rate meaning you'll be forced to wait longer when charging out in town.
This is a huge deal!
The fast charge option adds the high speed DC charge 30 mins 0-80% and upgrades the 3.3kw to the 6.6kw onboard.
That is a big deal!
In hindsight, prob should have just gotten the mid-grade Leaf with the 6.6w charger.

We almost bought a 2012 but waited and leased a 2013. We opted for the charger and rearview camera package and are glad we did. State (CA) and local air district rebates cut the already low three-year lease cost in half, making this an unbeatable bargain. We haven't driven our ICE car once in the 10 days since we got our Leaf S. This car does everything we need and is comfortable,
easy to drive and costs less than 5 cents a mile for fuel. No problem keeping up with traffic, especially if we take it out of Eco mode. It also appears to have more range than the previous models. We only charge to 80% to save battery and can drive almost 70 miles in urban and suburban traffic.
