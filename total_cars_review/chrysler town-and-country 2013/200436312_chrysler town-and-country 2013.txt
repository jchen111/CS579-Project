have a 2013 town and country with 17,500 miles on it. I live in Colorado and of course went to the mountains last weekend, scariest ride of my life. had my wife, daughter and two grandchildren in the car, going down a steep grade when I pressed on the brakes the car shook like it was going to break in too, more times I put on the brakes the more it shook. checking with brake specialist later it appears the front rotors
don't dissipate heat as fast as they should, appears Chrysler didn't put in higher grade rotors in case you every went on steep mountain roads, saved many millions but hoped nobody would have a bad situation like I did, wont ever buy another Chrysler product.

My wife and I just purchased a new 2013, and have under 1,000 miles on it.
We compared the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, and the T&C.
We loved the ride of the Honda, the 2nd row leg room of the Toyota, but the likes really stopped there for anything outside the T&C.
Options on the T&C are more plentiful for less money (rear entertainment, nav, heated seats...).
Of note, the T&C is the ONLY one to offer remote start.
The DVD in the Sienna looked like a shotty 3rd-party install, while both the Odyssey and Sienna dashboards felt very poorly and/or cheaply designed.

Our 2013 Town & Country van is great in many ways but the transmission has a noise that is caused by a redesign in the square cut gears.
Between 15-20 mph it makes an irritating noise that Chrysler has no fix for.
They basically say it is driveable so I have to live with it.
The dealership has found that this is common with other new vans on their lot.
This noise is persistent and louder than when we first noticed it (7200 miles now).
No repair, no replacement, nothing but a continual noise.
I would have looked at other vehicles if I had known that this would be an ongoing nuisance.

This van makes a lots of road noise it is like you drive with the window open when you go over fifty

Purchased the vehicle June 2012 and have about 12,000 miles on it.
Just brought it in to have the transmission module reprogrammed.

The recall did a big improvement on the smoothness of the shifting especially in the Econ mode.

If you buy this van get as many options as you can afford because they are well worth it.
Power folding third seat, twin DVDs, heated first two rows, remote start, Nav, bakup camera, Sirrus....
They are all great.

I had a 1997 T&C that my son (and family) is driving it has 175K on it with a replacement tranny 1 year old.


For price and performance you can't beat what Chrys offers... well pleased.

With the stow and go seats, its a winner.....
