I've owned 7 manual cars over my lifetime.
My year old MC Countryman S 2013's clutch never felt quite right, especially on hills.
I learned this past week how wrong it is --and that MC knows this and does not have a fix.
I was stuck in a mile of stop and go traffic --ON A HILL.
By 1/3 of the way up, the clutch was burning and smoking and I had tremendous difficulty getting to the top safely.
Although the burn smell lingered for another week, the clutch performed fine after that --no smoking no slipping.

I finally took it into the dealer to check it out.
Bottom line: Countryman clutches smoke on hills; expect it to burn out; hopefully it'll do so within warranty period. YIKES.

Handles like a dream and good mpg's for a sporty taller carlike "SUV. Perfect ride height, plenty of interior space. Power and accelerator feel are excellent. Get the S, get the manuel 6 speed and you will not be disappointed. Take good care of it and maintain it and it will take care of you for years to come and you will have so much fun. This is my second mini-cooper purchase and I have owned all brands. In my opinion this is one of the most satisfying mini coopers. Also HK system rocks if you can spring for it!
