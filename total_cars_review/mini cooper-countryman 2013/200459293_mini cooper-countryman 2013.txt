In this price range you're faced with a dreary econo-box, stripped out sedan or something else uninspired.
My main goal when purchasing a brand new car was something with space, great gas mileage and FUN to drive.
The Countryman checks every box and then some!
Don't get me wrong... There are other cars in this segment that are great value, but the Countryman is the only one you'll take a second look at when you're walking away from it in a parking lot.
Why not have your cake and eat it too?!
