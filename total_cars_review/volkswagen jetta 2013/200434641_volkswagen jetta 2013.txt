I've only had my 2013 Jetta SEL for two months, but it's been pretty great so far.
I like that it's got a sporty look inside and out, and I like the leather interior.
The acceleration is pretty good for 170HP and the ride is smooth overall.

My main complaints are some cheap aspects of the interior - for the price I paid and having the premium trim line, I can't believe it doesn't have power seat adjustment.
Also, to tilt the chair back, you have to pump this plastic pedal up and down (tacky). Also, even when you move the front seats all the way back, there isn't enough leg room for tall people over 6 feet.
Not much head room for tall people either.
Could have designed that better!
