 I have put 10,000 + miles on my 2013 Volkswagen Jetta
Diesel in about 9 months and the car is going strong, I have not had one single problem with this car, zero, zilch, nada .


 I have owned new Toyotas that were not this reliable in the first 10,000 miles.


 One reviewer stated that it was made in Mexico and was junk. Well the engine and transmission are made and assembled in Germany. The balance of the parts are made in Germany , Canada, and Mexico. It is assembled in Mexico.
 My point is that this is a car engineered in Germany and built to German standards. I have had no problems with paint, trim , or scuff marks not coming off plastic parts as some have stated.

 I bought this car on July 30 2013 and wish I had bought it sooner. I love this vehicle. the only gripe I have is the odometer is not constantly displayed in the speedometer, rather you have to page through a display screen to read it.


 Volkswagen claims 42mpg on the highway ' but I get 52 mpg with 60% highway and 40% city driving' as long as you keep the rpm's below 2,000 rpm's. this is with the automated manual transmission. my best for those conditions was 55.4 mpg.


 as far as some people saying the interior looks cheap I beg the differ it is not flashy like some other cars but certainly not cheap.



this car is a joy to drive on winding roads.
