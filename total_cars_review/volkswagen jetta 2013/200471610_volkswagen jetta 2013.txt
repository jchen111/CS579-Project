This is the second Jetta we owned and bought new.  The first was a 2004 diesel that we traded at 224,000 miles.  We decided not to get the diesel this time because we are driving less.  This car averages 35 mpg on the freeway!  We are very happy with the car.  No mechanical issues, drives great, comfortable to sit in.

I really like the car, it handles very well in the city and on the road, however, it makes a grinding noise when simply driving 25-30 mph down a city street.
The noise is right under my feet! At first they couldn't find anything so I had one of the guys ride with me and when he heard it he was puzzled. I was told to bring it back one day and they'll have a Tech ride with me so when I have a chance, I'll take it back! Had I known it was assembled in Mexico I never would have purchased it! I thought they were being assembled at least in Tenn. I'm so disappointed
that I wished I had purchased a Chevy or Buick!
