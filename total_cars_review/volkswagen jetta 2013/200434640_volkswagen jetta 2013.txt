I was looking for a small commuter car that, while reasonably priced, had a bit of style and personality for the daily commute. While some excel in certain areas, nothing else we test drove had the same combination of features, and style that this Jetta has. 

After two weeks of ownership, we are very pleased so far. Plenty of interior room for adults (or big kids) in the front/back seat. Rides & responds like a solid German car should. Great torque and acceleration (I'll give up the 2-3 MPG for that over others in the class). SEL adds some great creature comforts. 

Sure, it's not a BMW... but it is close enough to stand out as a cut above the class of economy appliances in this segment.
