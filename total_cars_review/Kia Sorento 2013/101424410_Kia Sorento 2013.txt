 The vehicle is great in every other way other than The MPG. My wife drives it most of the time and we both get the same results. 21-22.5 city and Hwy. The 22.5 was all interstate, two people in the car with no cargo. I am 61 yrs young and have had many brands of vehicles over the years and have had only two, Honda and Toyota that got the claimed MPG. I looked at the Honda CR-V but they would not give us enough for the trade and would not knock off enough on the car.

I purchased the Sorento in September and since have put on 3900 miles.
The mpg is not as advertised even tho I am a judicious driver, making sure the ECO indicator is on for over 95% of my driving.
My combined hiway/city mileage is perhaps 21mpg (hand calculated and not read off the display).
The handling is surprisingly good for a vehicle this size and shape.
The performance is adequate although my previous vehicle was a BMW 540i so there is no comparison there.
I'm still trying to get used to the site lines especially when backing up.
The backup camera is "useful" altho I still prefer to look back through the rear window when backing.
Interior; great.
Exterior; nice lines.

We bought a new 2012 Kia Sorento for our daughter in college in 08/2011. She put 9,800 miles on the car so far with all the normalized services being up to date. This Saturday 10/27/2012, she drove from Miami to Naple, and this car died on I-75! Thank the Lord that neither she nor her friend got hurt! She had it towed to Fuccillo Kia dealership in Cape Coral, FL. This dealership did the initial evaluation that day, but could not diagnosed the reason why the car died! Thus, my 20 year old daughter had to leave the car in the Cape Coral Kia dealership, and no one at this dealership offered to help her getting a loaner/ rental car through Kia warranty coverage! My daughter had to ask her friend to drive from Miami (an hour and 45 minutes away) to pick her up and bring her back to Miami that evening!
Of course, nothing was done on Sunday. On Monday, the Cape Coral Kia dealership had to ask that we should contact our Kia dealership in Clearwater to fax all the service records to them as all the Kia dealerships'service databases are separated with no connectivity or sharing capability among them. I called the National Kia Customer Service to ask for help as the Clerwater Kia dealership did not respond initially to our request. The toll-free National Kia Customer Service lady said that Kia National headquarter does not have any data on services at any of their dealerships, but she gave me a case # and her extension to call back or communication, which I thought initially as being very nice and helpful ( I even did a survey for her and gave her high marks!) 
I have to call the Clearwater Kia dealership's service manager to ask for help in faxing the service records to the Cape Coral Kia dealership to finally getting this done. After reviewing the well documented 3 services (on 08/11/11, 1/13/2012, and 06/11/2012), the Cape Coral Kia dealership agreed that we have had the car well-maintained by a Kia dealership during our short ownership, but th engine died fro unknown reason. The service manager there suggested that they will have to rebuilt the engine! We asked if this issue had been reported on other Kia Sorentos, and he replied that he does not or aware of any national recall nor issue with the Kia Sorento having premature engine failure. We asked that the engine should be replaced with a new engine from Kia factory in the Atlanta, Georgia plant in USA, rather from a rebuilt engine. The manager said that he will try to request for that. We requested that while the car being serviced under a Kia warranty-issue if my daughter could get a rental or loaner car for her to get to class at college. The dealership reported that they could do a rental car up to $30/day coverage only. However, since our daughter is 20 yo, she could not rent the car from any rental companies! The dealership insisted that they have no loaner car available for her to use! I called the Kia toll-free national customer service four times (twice on Monday 10/29/12 and twice on Tuesday 10/30/2012) using the previously given extension # to the service lady, Melinda. I was not able to get in touch with her either time, and upon calling back other customer service agents reviewed our case #, reporting that nothing was in our case report! So why created a case # and giving me an extension #!?
At this time, we are waiting for Kia's decisions to replace the engine, and to consider helping our daughter a way to get back from Miami to Cape Coral!
With this occurence of the failed engine on a new 2012 Kia Sorento with 9,800 miles after one year of ownership, I have to say that I am very disappointed in this car and with the above service issues from Kia National Customer Service Center! Thus, I would NOT recommend this car nor this car company to anyone at this time! Hopefully, this automotive company will learn to improve their quality and service in the future!

Bought this about 4 days ago after researching most all SUV's.
I went with the Sorento for style, price, and the cargo area. So far im pleased with the handling, GDI engine is peppy enough off the line and gets up to freeway speeds quick enough.
Wish i had a power seat and outside temp indicator.
Gas mileage so far is exactly as advertised, 22-23 city, Highway 31-32, and mixed about 25-26.

I traded in a 2007 Tundra with a 5.7L engine for this vehicle. We've had it for about 1 month. The MPG is above the sticker estimated numbers. We are getting 26.1 city and 34.5 hwy. I think this is great coming from a huge truck with 14 city and 17 hwy. The GDI engine seems to be the best balance between economy and still having some oomph on the road. The back up camera and rear sonar are great and the UVO is very easy to link to bluetooth HTC phone. We really like the A pillar A/C for the rear seat and the fold down arm rest for the rear as well. 

The rear under floor storage is huge and the ride is quiet and smooth. Though not a Lexus the value is right for the money.

Just leased this from Kia Sacramento, black color. I have done about 800 miles in the last week and have mixed feelings about the suv. I got the GDI assuming I would get a mixed mileage of about 25mpg but I am only getting about 19-23 mpg city and highway. This is a letdown for sure. I hope it increase down the line as the engine breaksin. 

The power seems adequate with 1-2 ppl in the car but with 4-5 ppl the car feels underpowered and I wish I had got the v6 engine if I was to get 20mpg anyway.
The ride is stiff and tends to wear you down and i feel tired after a trip which was never the case in my well sprung camry.
UVO has issues with bluetooth conectivity.

Was looking to buy a 2012 sorento but couldn't find 4 cyl with third row convenience package so just got a 2013 just the way I wanted it. I love this car. The gas mileage. It picks up very good. Smooth comfortable ride. Love the evo the back up camera and everything. Looked at the traverse, Mazda cx9, explorer but none matched the sorento. I never thought I would have a Kia but I love it. Great value.
