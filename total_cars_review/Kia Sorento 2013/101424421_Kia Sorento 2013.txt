we just purchased a 2013 kia sorento and we thought since we have the SX it will be great. only to find out that it gets really bumpy on the road. we had a 2008 toyota rav4 and compare to the shock, the ride is smooth. if i could just switch the shock absorber from my rav4 to the sorento and my car will be PERFECT!!

I really like this car.
It looks good and the ride is smooth and very quite.
The V6 has good get up and go.
I test drove the 4 cylinder GTL and felt it lacked power.


This model comes fully loaded and has great features.
It doesn't however get the stated gas mileage.
I get around 22 in the city and 24 - 25 highway.


I recommend this car for the price and the warranty but it would be an awesome car with a few tweaks.

I just purchased my 2nd Kia Sorento, I had a 2011 LX with the 4-cy and my lease was up and I upgraded to the SX V6.. I looked at many different SUV's and almost purchased the Jeep Grand Cherokee but after driving the SX I stayed with Kia.
My Only complaint on the 2011 was the Ride was stiff and power in the 4-cy, so The SX took care of both issues.. I love the Sorentos, cant beat the value they are the perfect size suv.
I have the 2-tone leather, dual roofs, nav, keyless start, lighting package, chrome wheels..
Drive one and you will be impressed.

Replaced a much loved 2004 Saab 9-5 wagon with the Sorento after driving virtually every brand/model available with AWD and a V6 that could be had for less than $40K+.
Final two candidates were a Subaru Outback and the Sorento. Though the former is a fine vehicle, the Sorento won out on features, fit and finish, and overall comfort combined with power and handling. 

Frankly, we didn't need 7 seats. But the combination of other options we did want forced the inclusion of the third row.

I recently made the decision to get a moore spacious vehicle. My girlfriend recently purchased a RAV4, and we both found that vehicle outstanding. I wanted a little more room, and I also didnt want 2 of the same cars.

I have been driving a BMW 5 Series Wagon for the past few years, and driving is a passion for me. I also have a Corvette.

Researched and test drove several SUV's, some larger than the Sorento. The KIA was the overall winner, hands down. Definately go with the V6, the milage is almost identical, and the performance is a big step up.

The size is just right, larger than most SUV crossovers, but not a tank.
