I chose the Frontier over the Tacoma, because the Frontier is 5% smaller but with a larger bed, and a larger engine with better economy.
It's also noticeably a few years fresher in design.
I got the now-discontinued PRO-4X with 6sp manual, which had to be shipped from Oregon to Nebraska.
The 6sp is a lot of fun, but the reverse gear is hard to find and should have been to the left like German autos.
The tailgate extender is nice because it's easy to remove.
The bed divider is functional but a bit obnoxious in that it's not an easy one-side affair to move or get out of the way.
Love the step rails and tie anchors.
The cruise control didn't work and I have an oil leak to have serviced.
