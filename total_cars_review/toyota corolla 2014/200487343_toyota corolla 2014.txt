This is my 4th Toyota and it is just what I would expect from the brand. 
Pros: Well equipped for price, nice ride, quiet interior, great style inside and out (never thought I would be able to say that one about a Corolla), average about 38.
I don't know what folks are talking about when they say it gets bad gas milage - they must either have a lead foot or are using really cheap gas.
Cons: rear hip room could be better if you have to cart 5 people around more often I would go with the Camry but 4 sit very comfortably in this car.
A little under powered, buy if you are looking for more power than you likely are not shopping for a compact sedan.

I drove the car for a few weeks before I had to get rid of it, power was horrible, fuel mileage was subpar even compared to my v8 camaro.
The weight was too light for safe driving in any road conditions, consistently hydroplaned in the rain and had to fight it to drive straight while passing another vehicle.
The power is extremely poor and the interior looked mixed together.
The only good thing was the exterior appearance and I even found that lacking. The ride quality was very poor too, had to get out of the car after thirty minutes to stretch because the seats lacked poor support.

Pros:
Comfortable, fuel efficient, roomy for a compact car, quiet, LED headlights are great, Entune system is easy to use/has good sound quality, back up camera, visibility, automatic climate control.

Cons:
Sun visor is short and does not telescope, CVT transmission is a little sluggish from a stop due to somewhat high starting ratio, not very sporty handling.


I am 5'11" and I can comfortably sit in the rear seat behind where I place the driver seat.
I am getting mileage slightly better than advertised on my LE.
The car rides nice.
Five adults for short trips only as the back seat is narrow.
People over 6' will have little headroom in the rear seat.

I traded in my Ford Focus for a Corolla and I have to say that I absolutely love it! It is smooth, quiet and has a great audio system PLUS a backup camera! You get so much for your money with this car.
I don't have any problems with the horsepower, but then again I don't race from stop lights or anything like that.
This is a great far for young people and also if you want a car with the most bang for your buck you'll want to check it out!
