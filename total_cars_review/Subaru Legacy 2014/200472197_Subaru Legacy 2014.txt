I only had this 2014 Legacy 2.5i Premium for only two weeks. It's my first Subaru. It has a lot of good features, but i'm having a hard time enjoying them. The ride is hard, it seems like you feel every little bumb in the drivers seat. I'm very disappointed! Traded a 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix with 136,000 miles,
it had it's issues, but rode great and was still fun to drive. Can't say the same for the Legacy. I'll have to give it some time. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think so. I might have to take a lose and try something different.
Let me know what you think!
