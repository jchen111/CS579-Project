I bought the FJ Cruiser because its cool! 
So far i have been very happy with the vehicle.
Its fun to drive, has plenty of power, and is solid and well built . Also it has all kinds of safety features through out.
As for some of the reviews I read online.....Go to your toyota dealer and drive one, if you can still find one, toyota cut the FJ line and wont be making them anymore.
