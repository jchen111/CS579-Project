I am having a lot of personal issues with my Jeep. First I would like to say I understand the Wrangler is not supposed to be the most comfortable or fashionable vehicle but I have highlighted some problems that are completely unnecessary.

1. All the plastic is "chalking" and turning white. It looks really bad.
2. Terrible amount of drive-train play. It feels like the transmission will fall out of the vehicle at some point (lots of clunking and knocking)
3. The serpentine belt will not stop squeaking.
4. During heavy rain fall the cowl vent will leak and fill the passenger and driver footwells with water.

I purchased my 2014 Jeep Wrangler Sport w/ 6 speed manual 10/10/2013.
The Jeep is very comfortable and shifting is quite easy.
There is very little road noise for the Sunrider top even at highway speeds.
My only complaint is that most of the Sunrider top components should be metal whenever possible.
I broke my bow lock on day one.
