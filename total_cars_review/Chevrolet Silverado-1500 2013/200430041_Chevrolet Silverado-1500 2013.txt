Please be aware that when buying the Silverado Truck that the spare tire is only 17 inch.
So if you buy a truck with 20 inches tires the spare is still only 17.
The dealer will tell you that it is a full spare but it is not the same size as what is on the truck.
Even the trucks with 18 inch tires come with a 17 inch spare.
