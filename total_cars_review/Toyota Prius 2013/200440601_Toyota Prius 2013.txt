This is the best car I have ever owned.
I had a VW Jetta Diesel with 200K on it but it was in the shop for eletrical stuff all the time. 
 So I wanted regular gas car with diesel type mileage PLUS a back seat for the grandkids.
The Prius fits the bill.
Gas is 75 cents per gallon or more cheaper. 
I now have 28800 miles in it.
On weekend trips I get low 50's mpg at 70mph & higher if I go 60 mph.
Overall I have averaged combined MPG of 49.9.
When I fill up it's $26.
I take a ferry to work & it is nice to sit in a car with the AC or heater on & the engine not running.
I carried my Garmin GPS for back up but the Prius GPS works great.

When the salesman first showed me the Prius Four with solar and moon roof, and all sorts of gadgetry, I was overwhelmed by all the fantastic features coupled with the great mpg that the Prius is renowned for and, plus its reliability, which it has proven to be a reliable car.
But, and this is a big but....they have failed to address driving ergonomics.
While this model four has power seats with lumbar support, I figured out about two months and 3000 miles later on the car that the driving position of the driver is quite awkward and this could not be addressed by changing my seat position.
If you are planning to buy a Prius, I suggest you carefully observe your seating and steering first.

Remote doesn't work 99% of the time.
In 6 weeks of winter, it started my car 3 times.
All with me outside, near the car.
Dealer gave me an extremely hard time. Went There 4 times before they agreed to take it out and refund my money.

They don't have a better remote to choose from and it cost just shy of $600.
Worse yet, after I had it installed and complianed ,2 employees told me they knew it wasn't a good starter.

 Back window has a poor view.

Rearview mirrors doesn't dim headlights enough.
Can be dangerous.

I owned a 2005 Prius for 8 years with no problems ever. It averaged 48-50 mpg most of those years. My new 2013 is a Prius 4 with more bells & whistles, which I thought would lower the mpg, but not so far. I averaged 53 mpg on my 1st tank!
I don't care for the center console area, less storage area than earlier models. And they replaced the map size door pockets with cup/bottle size pockets. I almost went with the larger PriusV because of the cosole area. 
The solar air circulation seems to work pretty good, considering I am in FL! Anyway, it was a little higher priced, but if it works as well as my old one, it'll be worth it not to have any issues!
