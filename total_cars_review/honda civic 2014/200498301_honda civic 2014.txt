I leased my 2014 EX Sedan in late July and now have almost 400 miles on it. I had a 2012 EX Sedan before this and I think this car is way better!. The steering feels better weighted, maybe even sportier, plus this car is quiet whereas my 2012 was loud. I love the backup camera and the LaneWatch monitor because I had neck surgery last year. I also looked at the Subaru Forester but I didn't want an SUV and wanted good traction because Chicago winters can  get messy, so the Civic fit the bill and it has FWD so yes, my Civic can handle the snow just like my old one did. The Honda's interior is modern whereas the Subaru looked outdated.

I leased this car and I've had it for a little over a month now, and I just LOVE this car!. I got a bang for my buck!. I had a 2012 EX prior to this car and this car is eons better!. The styling is awesome!. The steering is sportier, the interior is better built and I love the push button start, LaneWatch and backup camera. I need a backup camera due to limited range of motion from surgery. I pay $80 less than I did for my 2012 but get more for my money. The car rides smoothly but don't expect it to be like my Mom's Lexus or even my Dad's Acura though. I was originally going to get a Subaru for good traction for Illinois winters but the Subaru felt dull and dated compared to my new Civic.
