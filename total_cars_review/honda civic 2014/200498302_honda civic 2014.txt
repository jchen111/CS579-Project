I purchased a 2014 Civic LX sedan with the CVT transmission in July 2014. Have owned it for about 1 month and currently have about 1000 miles on it. Love it so far! Averaging about 35 miles per gallon and getting about 400 miles to the tankful! Power is adequate for most driving conditions and the car is fun to drive. Seats are very comfortable and this car has a ton of features for the money (I paid $16,700 not including tax and license). If you're looking for a safe, reliable, economical car, this is it.

After seeing many family members and friends over the years owning and loving their Hondas, I decided to give in and try one on myself.
I am simply amazed.
A compact car that is as roomy, comfortable, and quiet as a much larger, more expensive car.
Steering feels great, turns quick, soaks up the bumps, sudden braking no problem, gives the driver a feeling of confidence.
Acceleration could be a little better but it's acceptable from a 4 cylinder with automatic.
I've gotten 37 mpg combined city-highway.
Incredible value for the money.

I just picked up one of these. Would have never considerd a civic but the dealer near me was having great deals on them. Boy am i glad I went to look. The 2014 Civic is smooth, large on the inside and very fuel efficent. Everything is put together very well and the car is very solid. I never lack for power and hope to have this car for many years to come.
