I've only had the car one month and my back is getting worse by the day.
Have tried the seat repositioning and adding support cushions to no avail.
I have one more orthopedic cushion on order to try.
My husband's back went out after a 30 minute ride (he's 5'-10 and I'm 5'-4" - not overweight) and my 70-lb. 12 yr old niece also complains of back pain in this car.
 Leased through Honda Financial Service and they do not allow any transfers of leases (i.e. leasetrader or swapalease).
After researching this further, many Honda seat complaints have been posted in recent years.
(Oh - the dealer said they will take it back in a trade - at a $3000 loss to me!!)
