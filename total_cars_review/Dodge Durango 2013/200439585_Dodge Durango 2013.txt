It is everything I expected.
The Durango got a good review from Edmunds staff, and I have learned to trust their reviews.
Consumers Reports also rated the Durango tops in customer satisfaction which says something.
This is the first Chrysler product I have ever purchased.
I looked at the Explorer, CX-9, new Pathfinder, Highlander, and Pilot also.
The Durango matches the others in most attributes and exceeds them in having the shortest turning radius (maneuverability), longest driving range, and highest towing capacity.
It is also great looking.
