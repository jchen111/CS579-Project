I picked up base 2.5 altima 2014. Its a comfortable ride. I drove 5 hours straight and did not feel fatigue. However, the handling on it sucks. It is way too loose. Driving on the Highway/ Freeway with a bit of wind is a huge challenge and hard to steer. Almost got into a accident because of it. MUCH different from my 2008 model v6. I wish the handling was better, it would make it a better car. Otherwise, its fuel economy is pretty good. but Fill ups are 55-60 dollars. I also think that is a bit much. Car has good pick up, good braking and good design. When the warranty is up, I will lower it, and modify it to make it a better handling car just because I really like the way it looks.

 During test rides I noticed the leather seats were far more comfortable than the cloth seats. The cloth is very sticky. I bought
the Altima S with the sport value package because with the leather seats the cost was too high for me.
NASA should stick to rocket ships not car seats. I have not found a Physical therapist that recommends a curved back while driving. Headrest is slanted far too forward! Combine that with little lumbar support my back will ache after 1 hour of driving.
Make sure your ok with the headrest angle/seats.
Also the heater wont heat the car when its under ten below 0F outside. Otherwise the car is awesome! So fun and easy to drive!

I have owned my 2014 Nissan Ultima for 2 weeks now and my wife and I are (extremely pleased),
I have had my eye on this car for about a year.
I wanted to purchase a vehicle that would give me the most overall value, quality, for my money and a vehicle under $25,000 with all the features I like.
And that was the 2014 Ultima.
 We test drove the base model and that was nice.
But I wasn't going to leave the lot without having a spoiler and remote start.
After a little haggling and negotiating about those two features, the salesman found one with the Sports Value package.
Spoiler, Remote Start, and 16" Alloy Wheels.
We walked away with that added package for the price of the base model.
