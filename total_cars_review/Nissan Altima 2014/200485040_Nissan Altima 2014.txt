One of the most comfortable cars you can sit in. Good power and handles very well for its size. Interior is nice but the plastic cover of the radio easily shows too many streak the second you wipe it and it was the worst bluetooth commands i've tried. How many times must i confirm to call someone??? Superb fuel economy.

Love this car. Smooth, quiet and a good quality car for the money.  Traded in a 2014 Honda CRV for a 2014 Altima SV.  Getting better gas mileage and a smoother ride. Have noticed that noise when accelerating that everyone is talking about. It does not bother me though after all I am coming out of a noisy SUV.

 So far, car is as Edmunds
has described. The most remarkable thing about this car to me is the phenominal fuel economy I am
getting.
Most of my mileage is highway, but there's some stop and go rush hour on the highway and some weekend around-town driving also. Now that the car is broken in and temps are high for the summer,
I am averaging an honest 40-42 MPG per tankful! Over and over again.
No kidding. Incredible for a car of this size and power.
Of course, there's some focused driving skill that goes into getting these numbers and I've got the tires aired up to the max, but if you work with the car and it's shift program, 40+ MPG is easy for me during the warm weather.

I purchased a 2014 Nissan Altima SV and I love it!
I had a 2011 Altima that was a great car so I went back to Nissan and I love the changes they have made. The vehicle rides great and has "0" gravity drivers seat which makes a long trip alot more easy on my back. The Michelin tires that came on the vehicle create a smooth ride yet the suspension lets you also feel like you are still driving. The car looks very sporty and yet still has great interior space. Numerous people have commented on how great the car looks. The gas mileage is the best feature of all. I average 39 miles to gallon on the highway!! Nissan has built a great car that is fun to drive and yet provides the best gas mileage!

A car recently started crossing into my lane.
I swerved to avoid an accident and the pavement had erroded and my car went in the ditch. After going in the ditch, it launched me in the air, doing $20,000 on my 2month old Altima.
My car was totaled.
Nissan and their Air Safety Bag rep was all over me, then would
no longer take my calls, nor would the dealer that I my car.
Over 1.1 million Nissans have been recalled.
I bought mine on March 15, Car reccalled on March 25.
No one ever told from dealer to manufacturer.
Don't trust your safety to Nissan or a nice looking car.
 I was almost killed.

I had a problem.
I have a commute of 25 miles each way, none of which is on superhighway.
My car was getting old, and I needed to replace it.
My biggest requirement is that since I'm 6'8" I need to have a car with generous room for the driver.
I went to the auto show, and most of the small cars were just too tight.
Even in the mid-size class, only the Chevy Malibu, Ford Fusion, and Nissan Altima seemed to be roomy enough.
After test drives, I settled on the Altima bcause it seemed most comfortable to me.



Now, after having it for a few months, I have some overall good impressions regarding what I had heard about the car.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't get me wrong, I love my German engineering (Porsche, audi, VW) but Nissan has always been my favorite brand.
The two main reasons is you get great technology and performance for the price.
I drive 45 mi. each way for work, I just sold my 2002 VW jetta TDI which was on its last leg and bought a new 2014 Altima.
I LOVE THIS CAR!
I literally put the cruise control on for the whole commute and I never hear or feel the engine struggle, I also consistently get 520 miles per tank, the ride is so smooth and with 8K miles on it now I have not had one issues.
The only think I plan on doing to this car is adding anti-sway bars and lowering springs to fix the family car roll feel.

I recently purchased the 2014 Altima 2.5 SV.
After test driving the 4 cylinder models of the Camry, Accord, Mazda 6, and Hyundai Sonata, I felt very please with what the new Altima delivered.
I am averaging about 31 MGP - Highway and City combined!
The materials inside have a nice look, comparable and maybe even nicer than both the Accord and Camry models.
I paid 20,500 for my car after a 5K discount from the dealer.
The ride is very quite, smooth, and comfortable.
I really don't find the CVT transmission noisy as some people say it is, but the shifting makes the ride even more comfortable.
Now even the 2014 Accord offers the CVT transmission because it provides a better ride.
