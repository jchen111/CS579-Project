This is a fantastic car , I opted to get the 3.5 SV mainly due to the performance .
It is extremely fast for a sedan and extremely fuel Efficient . Slow down the RPM to about 68 on HWY and I consistently get
36 MPG, Brim to Brim fill up , Go about 75 and it will go down to the original specs which is 31 MPG.
I use only synthetic oil in all my cars .
For Texas hwy it is a fantastic car , quiet and Luxury.
I also have
Lexus and it is to me a bit better than my 4
year old Lexus which I paid a lot more for.
Nissan
CVT is considered the best of all Car makers .
I prefer Cloth interior , not a big fan of leather .
The car is Super quiet and is the best car I have ever owned , beat all

My first car was a 280Z. While I prefer my 2008 Maxima's ride personally, if I were in the market for a new car I would probably choose the V6 Altima since it has the same engine and _much_ better mpg (~27 vs my 22 average).

It has the standard 18" alloys that were an option on my '08 Maxima and is a IIHS Top Safety Pick + which is the highest possible. Its also a bit slimmer which I prefer.
