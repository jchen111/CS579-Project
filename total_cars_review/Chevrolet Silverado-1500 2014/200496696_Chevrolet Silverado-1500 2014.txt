Just passed the 1k mark and everything is go, except the bluetooth links to my Iphone about 80% of the time.
Been to the dealer.
Reflashed but still problem persists.
I give up and have just learned to live with it.
I have a regular cab 2014 Silverado WT2 4.3 that I love for its more compact size.
Doesn't create a hazard when parking at the local Publix.
When in the shop for the bluetooth problem, I was provided a 2014 5.3 extended cab.
 Think the 4.3 is actually peppier and slightly more economical.
Save your money and opt for the 4.3 for everyday use.
Taken back by the rude treatment I received from the dealer service writer.
Not treated with loyalty as I am at the VW dealership.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have to say I am very impressed with how the truck drives and feels on the road. I've owned a few 4x4's in my time and driving this truck even though its not a 4x4 it seems like it. For the power of a V6 to perform as this truck does is outstanding. Im about 500 miles into my first ever new vehicle and I'm in awe. I did have one hiccup it rained hard one day drove through some puddles and check engine light came on. the next day it was gone. Gonna have to check it out next rain. Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to any new buyer.
