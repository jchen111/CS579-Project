The new styling caught my eye and reminded me of the 80-90's body style which I love. I was sad to hear that the Vortec engines had been replaced but anxious to see what the promised added horsepower and economy would hold. 
The new Ecotec provides plenty of acceleration and the steering is smooth and responsive. The cab is quiet to outside noises, well insulated. The only problem I have found is shaking/vibration at higher speeds. It causes the center console to shake. But Its something I can live with.

I traded in my 2002 Trailblazer this winter for the new 2014 Silverado for my daily driver, hunting and hauling the boat around.

I bought this in February and it was very cold.
The morning after after I brought it home, the truck would not start, just a click sound, full electrical power and battery was good.
A few more attempts with the key and it started.
This happened multiple times.
Read on some truck forums that there was a bad batch of starters.
I had the dealer replace the starter and no issue since.
I rated reliability as poor as this 'new truck with less than 40 miles' could have left me stranded in woods when it was dangerously cold.
