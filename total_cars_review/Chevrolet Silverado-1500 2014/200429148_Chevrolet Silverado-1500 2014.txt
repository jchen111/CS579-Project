I bought a new 2014 Silverado Lt 2 wheel drive crew cab. It is a nice truck but on the highway it shakes terribly between 70-78 mph. I have had the tires rotated and road force balanced twice and it has not helped.
The truck has been in the shop twice for this problem. I received a loaner truck which is also a 2014 Silverado and it does the same. I would reconsider buying this truck again.
