Our new 2014 Silverado is good looking, very comfortable and fun to drive.
Unfortunately it has been plagued with several problems which detract from the good points. For example, the truck has had starting problems during cold weather which would make us very hesitant to drive very far from home during winter months.
Also, if you were used to, say, a 2010 Silverado and used remote start, the 2014 acts very differently.
Our 2010 would quickly warm the cab and heated seats but the 2014s' seats will not feel ward to the touch although Chevrolet says that they do come on.
Features advertised such as blue LED lighting behind the radio knobs do not work.

This is the first brand new truck I have ever owned.
My previous vehicle was a 2006 Dakota and this was a huge jump up.
I picked the Chevrolet because I am a firm believer in their product and paid attention to all of the high ratings from various reports.


The truck sits well and is very comfortable.
I love the leather seats and the cabin is extremely quite.
It rides very smooth and shifts well.
The backseat offers a lot of space.
I have two small kids and they have no problems with room.

We found our new 2014 Silverado attractive and fun to drive.
It has improved gas mileage over my old 2010 Silverado.
We did notice that the new seats don't seem as comfortable as the older 2010, but this may be because they are new.

The touch screen is very easy to use and a big improvement over some other vehicles we looked at.
The Voice system works well once you get used to it and learn key words.

We haven't been able to get the Heated/Cooled seats to work with the Remote Start.
We have had the truck to the dealer twice and have been told that everything is working as it should.
One morning, the temperature was 35 and the seats still would not turn on.
