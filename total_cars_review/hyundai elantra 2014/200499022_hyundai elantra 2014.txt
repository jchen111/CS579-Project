Just bought my new 2014 Elantra Limited and it may be to soon to get an accurate review on the reliability I can say I love this car! It's my first brand new car and i'm glad I made the purchase! Van Horn Hyundai was extremely helpful in making sure I got exactly what I wanted. I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a small or midsize car.
