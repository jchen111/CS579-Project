I bought my 2014 Elantra Sport one month ago. I have 1000 miles on it and have enjoyed every mile! I love the larger 2.0 engine and more power over the the 1.8 liter. Its like driving a sportscar with the functionality of a sedan. I have a 4 year old so you can see how functionality is important. I'm getting better gas milage than what was shown on the window sticker (with the Active ECO turned on). You do sacrifice power for the economy however. I almost bought a Sonata turbo but decided the Elantra Sport was a much better value for my budget and I still get the sporty feeling I was yearning for. The more I drive it, the more I like it. Get yours today, you'll like it too!

 I have only driven the car for 500 miles but, for the money, this is an excellent car. I bought the Sport model because I wanted the extra power and the car is very responsive. The car is extremely tight; no body or suspension noises.
 My only complaint is the tires. I would have liked more of a performance tire or at least an option for one. The Hankook is okay but I can see me getting a better tire when these are half worn. I have read about these tires and according to reviews, they do not perform well in the snow. That remains to be seen.
 My wife, who really isn't into cars, loves this car.
 So, overall, I would highly recommend this car, especially when you factor in the price.
