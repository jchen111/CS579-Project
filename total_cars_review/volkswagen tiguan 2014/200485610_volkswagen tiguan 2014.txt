I've had the Tiguan for about two months now and am happy with the purchase. Coming from a Camry, the taller height and tighter feel are welcomed. The build quality and cabin design are excellent, and the pickup is great, especially in Sport shift mode. I do find that the tighter feel can create a bumpy ride on rough roads. I don't have enough experience with other sporty cars to know if this is just what you get, or if it's unique to the VW. It's not enough to outweigh the pluses, but I notice it.

Bought our 2014 Tiguan R-Line and love it!
The rear cargo room is a bit small and I was super nervous about rear leg room if the trunk was that small but it was more roomy than a 2014 Escape!
I was amazed!
Leather seats are comfy and the memory seats are great too!
Off the line, there is about a full second of turbo lag but after that, it's gone.
Engine sounds throaty and has a great exhaust note.
We got 19mpg on mainly hwy driving which was disappointing but it's -10 where I live and I do accelerate hard on occasion, it also doesnt help that its not broken in!

Paying 40 grand is a lot especially when it doesnt have a backup camera or sat/nav(extra options) but still a fantastic CUV
