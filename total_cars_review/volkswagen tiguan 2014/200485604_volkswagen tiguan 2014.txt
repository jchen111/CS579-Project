I've had my Tiguan for just over a year. It's a nice car in many respects, and is more stylish and peppy than its competitors. The main problem is that, at certain speeds, the engine vibrates and causes an irritating, moaning noise. VW told me there is no solution because they program the automatic transmission to run at low RPMs as a way to improve fuel mileage. It's annoying enough that I really don't enjoy driving the car and will probably trade it in for something else.

Prospective Tiguan buyers should use caution. It's sexy and fun to drive in many respects, but the transmission software is horrid and causes the engine to lug and emit an irritating, low frequency vibration noise. It's benign enough during the test drive, but 6 months later and I was pulling my hair out. VW refuses to admit it's a problem. Why? VW has been losing the fuel mileage battle and the best they can offer is to program the transmission to run at the lowest possible RPMs. My car is a 2013, but the same issues continue in later models. Customer feedback to VW has been largely ignored. They seem to be more interested in attracting new buyers than making existing customers happy.

Bought 2014 Tiguan in May. Have driven 9700 km in 3 mos., mostly hwy driving. Previous 3 yrs drove a JEEP Grand Cherokee Overlander. Disliked it lagged when speeding up to pass a car. My 2004 Toyota 4-Runner had awesome pickup! Tiguan's has good pickup. I drive 13 hrs, & found I couldn't stretch my legs, so my left knee would stiffen & bother me. Putting my seat back, made me too far away. I'm 5'3".
Vehicle went in for oil change Aug 6. It drove perfectly prior; after it shakes like I'm driving in an earthquake at 80 km/hr and gets worse by 100 km/hr (60mi/hr). It feels dangerous to drive now. Taking it back in Monday morning to rectify whatever is the problem.
