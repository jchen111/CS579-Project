13000 klm so far, so good.
Gas mileage is the same as the fiat 500 I traded and uses regular gas and has lots more room.
Smooth ride and good handling.

6) Excelent road feel.

We love our little fit.
Feels and drives like a Honda.
Takes off and stops quick.
With both backseats laid flat, plenty of room in the back.
Our golden retriever does laps in the back.
we test drove the Fiesta and the Fit was so much more car for the money.

I looked at almost all of the competing vehicles and went with the Fit since it fit my needs best. For the price, it's hard to beat considering the legendary reliability of Honda cars. The closest compition is (IMHO) the Scion xD and Hyundai Accent.
