Sold my BMW 330xi and got my new Outback 3.6R Limited.
I've gone from the "ultimate driving machine" (which drove great, but didn't have a lot of room for people and stuff, didn't have a lot of ground clearance, and was getting very expensive to maintain) to the "ultimate do absolutely everything pretty well" machine.
Tons of room for its exterior size.
Plenty of power.
Nice ride.
Great value. Well built.
Amenities are pretty good for this price point.
While I miss a bit of how the old car drives when pushed hard on a curvy road, on all other points, I prefer the Subaru.

Waited until I had my car a couple of months to post a review. Looked around at every midsize crossover, from BMW X1, X3, Infiniti, Acura, Honda, Toyota and Volvo for months to find something that met the needs of city driving and parking while also comfortable enough for a road trip. After 4 BMW's this was quite a change, I've been so impressed with my Outback!
It does everything well, and the 3.6R has plenty of get up and go when needed.
The Limited has all the creature comforts, excellent visibility and the car has that safe, solid feel to it in all kinds of driving conditions, including the rare snowstorm in Atlanta!

I have my 3.6R 6 weeks now, and love it. I sold my Sporty coup AUDI TT and Safari van when bought this one. so far I'm loving it! the combination of having sporty car like and be able to have so much room for passengers and cargo, make it my favorite car. I test drove so many other SUVs and crossovers when I came to the point that outback is the best choice for me. AUDI Q5 was closest option for performance and handling, but it had less cargo and passenger space and $18000 more money.

Have been driving my 2014 6 cyl. Outback for 5 weeks now and have put almost 3000 miles on it. I cannot praise this little car enough. Glad my husband talked me into the 6 cylinder, It's getting 22 mpg around town ( suburban metro Washington DC ) and on our trip to South Carolina
a whopping 31 mpg. It's so much more fun to drive than my 1999 Yukon, and almost as comfortable on a long trip. Love it! My 6'4" husband even has plenty of head and leg room!
