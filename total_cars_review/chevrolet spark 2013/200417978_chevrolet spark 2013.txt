I purchased my 2013 Spark in March of 2013. The main issue is the a/c. After 4 trips to the Dealership, and several component replacements, they finally replaced all the a/c components. The a/c is now working better than when I purchased the car. I was informed by the service manager that apparently some of the a/c components were manufactured with defects. So if you are having the a/c issue, and are under the factory warranty,INSIST, I repeat INSIST
they replace the entire a/c system and you should be okay. If your dealer won't do it, go to another dealer. On the acceleration issue, there is a recall that just came out where they clean the throttle body and replace the PCV valve.

I'm not happy with the AC, at all.
If Chevy gets the AC up to where it needs to be, I'll update all ratings to "5."
As it stands, I'm in a city with 100+ temps that span three months in time. As I ran my sales calls, today, it was 95-101 outside.
I kept shifting around in my seat to get the air to blow on me and it wasn't cool enough, to boot. The driver's side vent is just not good at getting the air onto the driver, even with the other three vents closed.
In stop and go traffic, the compressor seems to kick out and the air is then even warmer.
Not cool, literally or figuratively. Chevy has me scheduled for 7AM, tomorrow.
I'll get a loaner. Lemon Law may be invoked.
Stay tuned.

In my mind Chevrolet has accomplished the mission it set out to complete with this car. There are always compromises and the Chevrolet team seems to have balance those well with this car. 
First are looks inside and out --
There is no reason a car should be ugly or have non-functional design features and here the Spark is terrific-- I hear "cute" often until the person sits or rides in car and then they go on about the surprising room and features that are in the car. 
Second is performance, People that buy this car want good MPG and realize that it is not a sports car. The fact the it is pretty slow is "ok" because this car lives up to and surpasses MPG ratings the EPA gave it.

We've had our 2013 Chevy Spark for about three weeks now and it's the best car ever!
We love using the Chevy MyLink Infotainment system that allows us to stream audio via our Smartphone using Pandora and Stitch applications, with more applications to follow in the near future.
