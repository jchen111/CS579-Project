I've done a lot of research before purchasing this vehicle. Dealer was quite helpful in research. 

Custom ordered with Premium+ pkg, pan roof, tow pkg etc on 08/22/2013. It was built, shipped and reach at dealership on 10/31. Impressive! I'm quite pleased with what this vehicle offers. Below are a few details:

* Handling is awesome with quick acceleration and solid stopping power - its cornering ability is impressive.

* Impressive Mileage: I get 30+ mpg driving conservatively in mixed city/hwy mode.
* Aggressive driving in sport mode gets me 22+ mpg in combined
* Highway driving alone 32+ mpg @ 50-55mph, best keeping it under 2000RPM. goes under 30mpg @ 70+mph,
