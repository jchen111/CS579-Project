I have my 2014 Sierra now for six months, and the frame rails have RUST all over them!
The black wax coating GM used is peeling right off!
There is a TSB (technical service bulletin) out there for the dealership to repair.
These rails are bare uncoated metal.
There are rust areas starting all over the rails, so unless they strip off wax over 100 percent of frame, and redo, the spot fix the TSB describes is useless!
Why would you use metal deemed Uncoated/Unexposed for a truck frame?
$$$$
How did these frames pass corrosion testing / validation?... Very disappointed GM!
