I have written a few reviews now and somehow they keep getting taken down.  This truck is by far the worst truck I have ever owned.  The transmission hunts for gears and bangs and clangs.  GM said that's normal.  The seat has broken 4 times and has been replaced, still broken.  Headlights are a joke and a safety issue when it is wet out.  Nothing in the truck works right.  GPS cannot find addresses, and that ride, awful.  When I hit a bump I get a ping in the rear end. Again, according to GM normal.  If you like to drive you don't want this truck.  I love looking at this truck but I cannot stand driving it.  It's awful, its slow and those gears are some of the worst I have ever experienced.

very disappointed in this pickup.  transmission down shifts when going at low speeds and try to speed up.  the Navigation system has started acting up by adding 1hr 30 minutes to arrival time on and dealers says nothing they can do.  just have to live with it.  Totally unacceptable but can't get GMC dealers to even try find the problem.
