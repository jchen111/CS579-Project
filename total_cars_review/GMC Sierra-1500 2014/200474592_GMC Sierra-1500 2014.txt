I purchased my new truck September 2013.
I made the mistake of paying for the heated/cooled seat option.
Big mistake.
In cooling mode hot air blows on rear seat passengers.
I was told after a few miles the air will cool off.top.
The hot air still blows hot after 75 miles.
Since I usually have a person in the back seat that is a waste of money.
Also after 75-100 miles it feels like I am sitting on a fist sized rock.
Guess what, the dealer reps got in and out of the truck and stated they could not duplicate my complaint.
Initially I got 21.5 to 22.5 mpg at 68mph.
Whick was why I boutght the truck.
After a recall I now get 18 if lucky.
I am looking to trade it off for a Ford.
