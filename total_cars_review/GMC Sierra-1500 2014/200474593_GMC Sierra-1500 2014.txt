Have been driving for almost two months now and am a little underwhelmed. Its a smooth ride and the road noise is much improved over my 2007 Silverado but the 4.3 just doesn't seem to be enough for this truck. The mpg on the highway have been about 20 which is ok but the city mpg so far has been in the 
9-11 mpg range which is very unsettling considering GMs mpg claims.
