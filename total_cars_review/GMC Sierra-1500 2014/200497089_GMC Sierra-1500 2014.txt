I wrote a few articles now "looks good drives poor" Unfortunately I need to make a third.
After GM bought back my 14 z71 and I ordered a Denali, more problems.
The steering wheel was off from the factory.
If you hold it straight you will crash.
It is currently in the shop for a faulty gas pedal.
Once again the driver's seat has broken.
The backup camera and audio only works when it wants.
Drive like whip lash and a throttle response that is poor at best.
The 2013 rental Tahoe I currently have drives like a dream compared to this truck.
I like the idea of the truck, but the execution is awful.
A new truck should not require me to have an outside company tune the computer.
