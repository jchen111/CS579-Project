Just got the 2014 SXL model. What a great SUV!-- and this is coming from BMW-- which I will never buy again. The Sorento has great handling, pretty good gas mileage and it looks AWESOME! This is my first KIA and I have a feeling I will be a long time customer.
Friends of mine also own the new Sorento and have told me that the reliability is fantastic. If you are in the market for a mid-size SUV, I would definitely recommend a test drive.

Our new 2014 Kia Sorento SX-L AWD is our second Sorento.
We bought a 2011 EX V6 FWD in April 2010 and put about 60K (happy) miles on it.
It had all of the available "bells and whistles" at the time but the new 2014 SX-L is a huge advancement in nearly every category.
It is so feature-rich, comfortable, powerful and well finished that I think it beats the competition from Honda, Acura, BMW etc. for thousands of dollars less.
Admittedly, this is the top of the line so the Nappa leather and panoramic sun roof won't be found on every model.
Aside from the many features on the SX-L, I would strongly recommend the AWD version.
It really makes a positive difference in how the vehicle drives.
