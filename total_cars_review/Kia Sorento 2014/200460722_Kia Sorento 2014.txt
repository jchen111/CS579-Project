I've had my Sorento V6 AWD for eight months, and accumulated 20,000 miles.
Front seat comfort (aided by heating and cooling) for long trips is superb.
The overall handling, acceleration, braking, ride comfort...they all add to a relaxed experience behind the wheel.
This car is easy to drive in the crowded city, and it's a great highway cruiser.

14th car I've owned and my first Kia after owning mostly Fords and Toyotas. I test drove virtually all of the competition and settled on the Sorento as the best combination of size, handling, quiet ride, technology, cargo layout (5-seater) and V6 option. The lengthy warranty helped me make the decision because I'd never paid any attention to Kia in the past and reliability was an unknown. I've driven it about 2,500 km and so far, I'm delighted.
