My 2012 Sorento was great so I traded to 2014 when time came.
 The auto dim feature of the instrument cluster makes it difficult and at times impossible to see speedometer needle.
Kia says it is "working as designed"
"Kia cannot help you"
It is bright with no problems at night/in garage and on cloud/stormy days.
Since design features are not covered by warranty Kia America refuses to address the matter.
 7 others have filed same complaint with National Safety Board.
I must get rid of the car before i have an accident while trying to locate my speed.
Also window shade rattles
"no adjustment can be made".
Will be my last Kia.
