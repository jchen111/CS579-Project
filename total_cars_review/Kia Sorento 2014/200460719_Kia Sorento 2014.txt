This is my first KIA out of 14 other cars I owned in the past and I am very impressed. My 4-cylinder AWD Sorento LX gets the best gas mileage in area with altitude of 4,300 feet out of any SUV I owned in the past Â 24.3MPG in mixed 50% city/50% highway driving without even breaking the 5K barrier. I am also impressed with is the built quality and quality of materials, both interior and exterior. The ride is a little stiff but soft (no rattles or squeaks), which makes this SUV let you feel it and handle better. The interior is designed very well. I am not so much impressed with looks of the exterior but I donÂt really care whether I get compliments. Test drive it and you will be thrilled.
