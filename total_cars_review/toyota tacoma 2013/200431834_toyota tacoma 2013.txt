I find it hard to believe how many people have blind loyalty to these trucks. There are countless issues with them if you just look them up on forums and blogs. I have most of the problems people complain about: Drive line vibrations, brake shutter, wheel shutter, loud dashboard creaks and rattles. The whole truck shakes like crazy when I try to accelerate hard from a dead stop. The engine is chirping like there's a belt problem. The valves clatter when the water temp is cold. I practically have to wait for the water temp to get to normal running level before it stops. I love the truck and I want to keep it forever, but I get the feeling it either won't hold up or I'll grow to resent it.

I have only owned Rangers and F150s my whole life.
Its 2012 and Ford no longer makes the Ranger nor did they ever offer a 4 cyl double cab.
I turned to Toyota due to claims of reliability and the size of the Tacoma.
Its the perfect size. Bought the Double cab prerunner with the 4 cyl motor and LOVE it.
Plenty of power to get around.
MPG is right on EPA estimates which I cant say about my F150.
So far have averaged 21.4MPG with heavy city driving.
The build quality is great as are numerous features of the truck.
It looks tough and sits high which I like for visibility.
