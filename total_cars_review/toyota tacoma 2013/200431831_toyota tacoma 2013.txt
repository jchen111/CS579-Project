I had been driving a 1994 Toyota pickup for 17 years and decided to trade for a new one.
I was sure it would be another Toyota, and spent quite a bit of time deciding which model to get.
I'm hopeful that my research might help others in deciding what to buy.

I mostly drive the truck back and forth to work, so it was important to get a comfortable vehicle that is fun to drive.
The SR5 package has more comfortable seats in my opinion and a nicer interior, so I got the SR5 package.
The 4-cylinder has plenty of power for me.
The truck is quiet and comfortable and I enjoy driving it.

I recently replaced my 1997 T100 SR5 with the access cab Tacoma. I had well over 200,000 on the T100. I figured the Tacoma would serve me well also. I ordered the 4cyl Base Access Cab with the SR5 Package. The milage for the first month has been 24.6 - 25 MPG. The fit and finish is excellent, Millage is where it is advertised, and performance with the 4 cyl. has exceeded my expectations. I like the rear view camera, makes hooking up my small trailer a snap! I have a single axle trailer that I use to pull my Arctic Cat Prowler around with. The trailer loaded weighs about 1700 lbs., I have not
had any problems to date. I'd purchase the same truck again!
