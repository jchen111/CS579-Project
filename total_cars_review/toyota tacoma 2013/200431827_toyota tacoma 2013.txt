My 2013 Takoma, purchased new 3 months ago, has 6250 miles on it.
The dealer (Ourisman Chantilly Toyota) tells me that the clutch is completely worn down.
I have driven manuals for years and am certainly not hard on the clutch, nor do I "ride" the clutch.
It is hard to rebut the conclusion that this is somehow my fault and the clutch is excluded from every warranty, even the fancy "Auto4Life" service contract and the "Carefree Car Protection Service Contract".
The repair will cost more than $2,000.
I submit that this is a mechanical problem reflective of the truck.
