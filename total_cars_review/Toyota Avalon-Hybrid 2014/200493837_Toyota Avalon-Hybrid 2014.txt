There's a lot to like about this car, but don't buy one.
I test drove it, and thought the ride was a little stiff, but acceptable.
I've been driving it for a month now, and each day the harshness of the ride becomes more annoying. Every rut, crack and bump on the road is telegraphed through the chassis.
You'll hear
every road imperfection and feel it in your feet on the floor and through the seat.
On a rough road, you'll be thrown around like a rag doll. The longer you ride in it, the more horrible it becomes. Toyota at least owes us an apology for the terrible suspension. But they really owe us a recall and repair of this abomination.

After driving a Camry Hybrid for almost 4 years, I find the move to the Avalon Hybrid a nice step-up.
The Camry was a very good, very reliable car for me and I got good value on the trade-in.
The Avalon is more luxurious, and has a smoother ride, and slightly better fuel economy.
I am finding that with the car not quite broken in yet, my Avalon is getting very close to the EPA mileage estimates.


I do not understand the comment about "grabby" brakes.
Contrary to the test review, I have found Toyota has done a good job of integrating regenerative braking with normal braking.
The new Avalon has improved on this aspect of performance.

NAV system is primitive compared to my five year old  TomTom.
Theres no 3D, there are no traffic light cameras and there is no display of current speed limits.
Programming the NAV is tedious.
In seven years the NAV system has moved ahead one year in its development [see below].

Further, the NAV system voice even at the lowest level #1 is much too loud; and there is no way to lower the volume, save disabling all sound.
It is far louder than my 2007 Toyota Avalon Limited at sound level #1.


There is a plastic chrome bezel around the instrument cluster.
When sun hits the bezel, it is most distracting.


Dealer team says thats the way it isUgly situation.
