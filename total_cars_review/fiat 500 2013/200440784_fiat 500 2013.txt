I have had the 5-speed Fiat 500 for a few weeks now and so far I am happy. My main concern in getting this car was the quality - but getting a warranty with it eased the pain. When driving alone or in a big city: this is the car to have. It has prominent strengths and weaknesses.This car is not meant for offroad, mountain, or utility driving. It dominates normal streets and freeways though with small size, agility, and economy.

After 2 months of ownership, I can tell you great things about my blue green Pop.
It's retro styling is so fun--it makes me smile every time I see it.
I love the manual transmission; it is fun to drive and very fuel efficient.
I average 36.5 mpg combined, and reached 44mpg using premium gas on a highway only trip.
I am still evaluating using premium gas in town, but performance is definitely worth it for a highway trip.
The seats are comfortable, and I love all the manual climate control.
The bluetooth works well from both front seats.
The standard audio system is really good and versatile.
There is good headroom without a sunroof for taller drivers.

Traded in a 2010 Prius for my 2013 FIAT Pop four-dr hatchback. Bright Yellow. I loved the Prius but did not care for the Service Dept for Toyota in my area.
Happy to not have to return to them.
My FIAT has six-gears Automatic transmission.
It has a Sport Mode button.
I live in a hilly region of AR and appreciate the sports-car feel of my FIAT 500.
Attended a FIAT Rally recently with 22 FIAT 500's.
Great time on mountainous roads!
Staff from Landers in Benton AR made it all the more fun. I highly recommend both the car and the people from Landers.

This is a good (great) driving car.
A pleasure to drive.
I have the basic model and still it has quite abit extra's.
I'am a driver and like the fun of driving a solid steering car.
This one goes from a regular driving car to a Ferrari when the sports button is engaged/push at the console.
Great for curvy roads and parking lots or anytime.
On the hwy I leave it regular mode and just cruise.
Did I tell you it has cruise control too.
Anyway don't push the OMG button unless -
are you experienced - (Hendrix)
I have the auto transmission and this is great. I'am 60 and this shifts a lot in the sports mode (OMG).
There you have it.

I am an old dude 53, I have a Light seafoam green with ivory interior 2013 500 pop 5 speed with a sunroof , alum wheels, and beats stereo , on top of all the other goodies that just come standard on this car . It rocks , fun , fast , stable, quiet , I've owned one of just about everything over the years from Pintos to Porsches , literally. This is hands down one of my favorites. My only complaint is that the turbo doesn't come in ANY color I want!
after 11,000 miles in just under 3 months not a single problem , rattle , or squeak . Maybe I bite the bullet and go for an Orange Turbo at the end of the year, anything but silver or grey . I'm sick of seeing silver cars .

Purchased my 2013 10 days ago.
 I'm impressed and very excited.

The value of the Pop for the money cannot be overstated.
After researching many used cars and new I was thrilled to pay $15,560 out-the-door for a new car with 4 year warranty, comfortable ride, fun ride, cruise control, power windows, usb, bluetooth...
 It does great on freeways and curvy roads.
The Sport button is especially fun on the curvy roads.
Parking and maneuvering is great.
 Excellent gas mileage - exceeds the 31-40 mpg ratings.
The car meets the needs and satisfies the wants.
The engine delivers.
 

I pulled the rear headrests and keep the rear seat down and enjoy the open space in the back.

I was going to buy another Mazda, but my local Dealer low balled me on my trade.
Went to the local Fiat dealer, I had been wanting to test drive the 500.
 Got a great deal on a 2012 Pop, wanted a 2012 Sport, ut they didnot have any left.
I had the car for little over a month.
It is fun to drive, with the 5 speed, I would not get the automatic if you are buying one with base engine.
Tha gas mileage is good.
I called l and got the complete Owners Manuels for the car.
The car is smarter than I am...<G>
At the end of this model year I might have to buy the Turbo Model...<G>
