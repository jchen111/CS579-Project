I purchased a new 2014 4Runner SR5 Premium because of the reduced interest rates for this model. I previously had a 2006 4Runner Limited and a 2000 Limited, which I was pleased with. I chose the SR5 Premium because it had everything except fancy wheels and the leather seats and I felt the Limited would not hold up well on my ranch with its smaller tires/larger wheels. The engine is efficient and the vehicle has more ground clearance than the 2006 4x4 Limited I had.

This 4 Runner is fun to drive.
With all the options and what I got for the money was a better deal in my mind than I could have gotten for other SUVs on the market.
I looked at purchasing an older model with similar options, but found that the value of the used ones were very close to the price I paid for a brand new one, that I like better anyhow.
The instrument cluster looks much better than the older ones and is lit with blue LEDs.
The seats are not quite as comfortable as other SUVs I tried, but they do the job.
The offroad and snow performance even with highway style tires is where this vehicle shines.
This is a nice SUV, I am happy with my purchase.
