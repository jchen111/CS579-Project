We have had our 4 Runner for about a month now and it has been nothing less than spectacular! When we began our search for an SUV we did not want the new trend of the crossover SUV. IMHO a crossover is nothing but a station wagon and most car companies are switching to that trend. Luckily Toyota has stuck to tradition with the 4 Runner by keeping it a true SUV in every sense. The 4 Runner is a true body on truck frame masterpiece that is very fun and easy to drive on the road and is at home when the pavement ends. It has a strong 4.0 V6 at 270 horsepower and 278 pound foot of torque. It will tow up to 4700 pounds which is enough for and ultra lite travel trailer, boat and other various toys.

So I've had the 4runner for about a month and logged about 400 miles so far.
I bought it because I believe something that looks like an SUV should be off road capable and ready for anything. First impressions are as follows ...
- Very comfortable ride for a body on frame architecture.

- Engine seems capable enough
- Beautiful exterior design (in my opinion)
- The sound system (and Entune) could be better.

- Gas mileage could be better.

I'm looking forward to a chance to test it out off road as soon as possible.
