I bought my Accord V6 in June of 2013 and have approximately 11,500 mostly highway miles. In light, early morning traffic I average 35 MPG on a 30 mile trip to work (90% highway) which is better than both my 1999 Civic 1.6L manual and ex-2002 Nissan Sentra 1.8L manual. Engine is quite powerful - several sources quote 0-60 in 5.5 seconds which is well into BMW 3 and 5 series territory. No problems so far. I purchased the "Modern Steel Metallic" exterior with the black interior. I wish I would have held out for the tan interior as the black shows every tiny bit of lint. My only real complaint is the 'premium' stereo is not really all that premium. Great value for the money and fun to drive.

I purchased my 2013 Honda Accord V6 used with 10k miles on the odometer; I now have 12k after a month of driving.
IÂve noticed the ticking noise in the steering wheel and a metal on metal scraping noise coming from the brakes.
IÂm taking it to the dealer tomorrow for their diagnostics of the problem.
The exterior redesigned is one of major reasons I settled on the Honda not to mention its track record for reliability.
The DNA of this car is Honda, IÂm positive the engineers were not shooting for a 4dr NSX when they redesigned the Accord.
With that being said, what I was looking for was a middle of the road transporter with decent gas mileage.

The car seems to have a stiffer ride than I would expect. Seems about right for the Sports edition but not a four door.
Within two hundred miles the transmission had to be replaced. I am trying to work something out with American Honda for compensation for having a brand new car with a factory remanufacture transmission. I asked for a different car but they will not go for that.

After five months with the extremely annoying vibration from my Accord, I traded it on a 2010 Infiniti G37, taking a big financial hit.
Honda says the vibration is "normal", as in normal for a 3-cylinder car, that is.
Unfortunately, this condition was not apparent on the test drive, so be forewarned if you are considering purchasing the V-6.
Variable Cylinder Management may yield very good MPG, but at the expense of a terrible drive experience.
I have requested compensation from American Honda, but am not optimistic.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I hit the 1800 to 2000 RPM's there is a vibration I feel in the steering wheel. I also
may feel it in the gas pedal. I brought the car back for it first oil change and told them at the dealership. I was told it maybe the wheel alignment, which they did. The problem was still there. I brought the car back again and this time the mechanic drove the car. He told me that it is a six cylinder car that changes to a lower cylinder number that's what causes the vibration.
I think
they are lying and don't know what the problem is. I will ask to talk with the factory representative. The car is a leased vehicle with approx. 8200 miles.

This car, the 2013 Honda Accord, EX-L V6 is awesome. I love the way it handles, the power that the V6 puts out and the way it handles and manuevers is awesome. I just can not say enough about how I love driving this car. I Feel in complete control when driving this car and it is an amazingly great feeling.

Lease was up on 2010 Acura TL.
I was amazed when looking at the Accord.
It has nicer interior, more backseat and trunk room, better amenities, equal power and much better gas mileage
than my 2010 TL.
 Accord EXL V6 has very capable handling, great power, and very comfortable, controlled ride.
And I love the seats.
I looked an Altima, Fusion, Optima, and Passat.
The Accord outclassed them all.
And for under $27,000 and 1.9% financing, I purchased the Accord and passed on leasing.
 It will be in my garage for a long time.

I never would have dreamed of owning a Honda Accord. I've seen them all of my life and regarded them as unremarkable. 

However, it came time for a new car and I tested the Accord.

I took a drive in the V4 but opted for the V6 due to the automatic transmission and the power behind the engine.

I have ZERO regrets with my purchase. The engine of the V6 pleasantly roars to life with impressive speed and smooth shifting. The interior is luxurious with great build quality and offers more convenience than I could ever want.

My only qualms are that the Accord takes rough roads and bumps hard and that while sporty - it could be more fun to drive.

Overall, great purchase and overall excellent car

Interior and features are much improved over my 2003 Accord EX-L
V-6.
However, there was no signifigant improvement in the handling or ride of this car over my 2003 and it was very noisy on rough pavement and the suspension let me hear every imperfection in the road.
