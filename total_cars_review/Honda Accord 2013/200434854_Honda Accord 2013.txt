Extremely happy with my 2013 Accord Sport.
Received around 26 miles per gallon for the first 9,000 miles and then over the next 1,000 miles, it jumped to around 30.
Now broken in, it feels quicker and is becoming more fun to drive. The build quality is rock solid, not even the slightest rattle from anywhere. Sport mode is fun on the highway for zipping around people.
Seats are comfortable. The interior is attractive and all the materials you touch are high quality.
Love the leather trim on the doors, wheel, and armrest.

Miss a sunroof and push start but can't complain because the price was resonable.

Everything just feels solid and I could see myself driving it for 200,000 miles!

Well after 9 months and 9 k miles I think I know the car well. First it looks great, rides well, comfy, no problems, and the gas mpg can be fantastic if you keep your foot off the floorboards.
I have seen high 30s low 40s wow ! But I drive it quickly so many times I am in the upper 20s or low 30s.
I am not quite sold on the cvt, don't get me wrong it work fine , can be sooo smooth and for 99 percent of people the smoother the better, but I like to feel the shifts so the car is too smooth and quite at times.
It has plenty of power and on the highway it is effortless to pass and accelerate but off the line the cvt
timid till 10 mph
Great car

I purcahased a new accord sport July 15 2013 with 3 miles on it. At my first oil change at 6500 miles, I noticed a small oil leak (1 drop) where the CVT bolts to the engine. I took it to the dealer for a warranty repair.Possible torque convert seal issue. I will post more details when the repair is finished. I am dissapointed about Honda transmission problems this early in the game. I will say the dealer was quick (no appointment) and offered a shuttle to work. If all goes well and the problem does not return all is good. sound like many people will face this same trouble. Fix it before the 30,000 miles waranty expires.

6 months in to my ownership, and I love this car. Have averaged 32.5 mpg since new with 70/30, highway/city driving. Minneapolis to chicago trip, averaged 38.5 mpg. you get use to the cvt, but it really does work well overall. Even a lot of regular transmissions are twitchy sometimes. The seats are comfortable for long hauls and the car is easy to drive. The Pandora app is very nice, and the car syncs with my iphone 5 quickly. The black color is still gorgeous. The paddle shifters make it easy to downshift even when the car is in drive, which is useful for some spirited driving, or slowing without braking. I recommend this car to a lot of people, and a couple of them have bought one.

Purchased the Sport back in May and have not looked back or regretted the decision.
Come from a Ford Family and just had enough of Big Blue.
I did test drive the Fusion as well as the Nissan Altima and for the money and the overall package, it was a no-brainer.
Plus, it didn't hurt knowing the owners of my local Honda dealer.
All the ratings above, basically describe the car.
Wasn't sure if I was going to like the CVT but I don't have any complaints.
Very smooth and precise and handles very well. Very happy with the purchase and the move to Honda.

Well I originally was looking at the EX-L however did not really like the touch screen below the main screen. I opted for the Sport mainly for the wheels and the control knob below the main info screen. I prefer knobs over touch screens. Personal preference. Car feel larger inside then it looks, and the ride is firm yet in control. Was never a fan of CVT trans however I can honestly say that you rarely feel any of the rubber band pulling that I have expierenced in my Honda Insight. They may have started to figure it out. I personally liked the Mazda 6 however the only positive I had to buying Mazda was that it had a automatic trans opposed to CVT. Otherwise the Accord wins in all areas.

For the most part I'm pleased.
But the dash noise, rattles and speaks are getting to me.
When I first start to drive the car after it's been sitting in the heat the center dash snaps, crackles and pops.
Sometimes on rough highways there is a rattle/buzzing noise from the center dash in front of the audio display. If I place my hand on this flat part of the dash the noise stops.
I had a friend video this noise just in case the dealer can't reproduce the noise.
I don't know if the video will help.

I have a 2013 Accord Sport with the CVT transmission. It has become so annoying to drive with only 3000 miles that I'm considering trading. Honda tells me there is no record of a problem and the dealer says the unit isn't serviceable. 
Under normal driving, there is almost a constant slinky toy or rubber band feeling that actually makes the engine rpm go up and down when it should be smoothly accelerating. There is some kind of intermittent slippage going on the whole time you are driving it. Anything but Constant Velocity.

Honda is playing stupid and merely patronized me with statements like: "We'll make a record of your concern." 
I own a Murano CVT so I'm familiar with this technology.

It's a pretty good car, but buyers beware of some strange features. The Sport edition has some weird thing on the steering wheel called a paddle shifter. It's there so you can get the feel of a stick shift on an automatic. But the problem is... you go to hit your blinker, and lo and behold you've just downshifted going like 80 miles an hour... really dangerous! The other weird feature is the driver's side rear view mirror. It has a second little mirror attached to it. This bends the image of the oncoming car. I'm driving down the interstate, and this car is coming up beside me, and to my surprise he cuts over into my lane and nearly sideswipes me, so I swerve. But that was only an illusion.
