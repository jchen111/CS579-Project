I had a 2008 Grand Caravan SXT that I LOVED. It saved my life in a terrible accident. I had a 2010 Journey after the van that I loved. I got rid of the Journey and got a 2010 Sebring that I loved. I decided to go back to a van and purchased a 2014 Grand Caravan SE with Rear Entertainment Package. I liked my 2008 better... I have 6000 miles on the 2014 and the blower is making a grinding noise. I liked the 3.8 in the other van better than the 3.6 I have now. I really wished I would have got another SXT. The SE has nothing compared to the SXT. I do love the mygig radio. Fuel mileage is averaging 24 MPG. I would purchase another van but would never get another SE to save a few dollars.

As an owner of 4 Caravans since 1985 I was seeking to replace my present Caravan with a 2014 "Grand Caravan." Much to my chagrin Dodge has a base seat in all but the SXT which has no height adjustment. This is not Grand at all as th tall driver does not have legroom. This I see has been noted by other consumer reviews. You can get a power seat that has decent adjustments, but your going to have to pony up serious dollars to get the SXT model. I contacted the Dodge Customer Assistance Center and this is their response,Dear Art:
Thank you for contacting the Chrysler Customer Assistance Center with your product improvement suggestion, however Dodge only works thru consumer forums. Thanks Dodge

This is my fifth minivan. These are not the minivans of old.
I bought the AVP with some upgrades.
Just got back off long trip, got 20 mpg in the city, and 29.5 mpg highway, with 24.7 with a mix situation.
Love it.
Used the stow and go seats variable positions for a different need everyday.
I love the handling. I love the cab forward design, easy to see the road and park.
The ride can be a little bouncy, but not bothersome.
I have the base seats but they are very comfortable.
I had a long drive at night and can see the road much easier than in a sedan.
The best value in a vehicle period.
My only complaint is that the transmission wants to shift out and then back down in the hills.
