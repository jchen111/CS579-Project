I Traded a 2012 GMC Acadia.  I drove a Chrysler Town & Country rental while having hail damage repaired on my Acadia.  I was highly impressed as were my kids.  I decided it was time for comfort rather than over priced SUV.  My husband 6'2" fits comfortably.   I compared the Grand Caravan to Chrysler T&C, Honda Odessey, Nissan Quest.  Ultimately it was the stow and go as well the fact the grand caravan feels like I'm riding higher off the ground than Odessey.  You get more bang for your buck with the Grand a Caravan. I bought it brand new 3 months ago with 14 miles on it.  Now after a trip across the country with 6 people, I have over 9,000  miles
