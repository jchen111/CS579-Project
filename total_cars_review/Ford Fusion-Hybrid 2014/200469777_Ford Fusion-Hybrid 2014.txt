We can't understand what the fuss is about the navigation and touch system. It did take a while to find all the many features, but now it is easy to use and the navigation system is very accurate. The four quadrants make it easy to shift from one screen to another.
Just a little time with the manual and you should be all set. 
This is the first American car we have had and we love it. We are getting excellent mileage...better than the newly corrected MPG. We have about 3300 miles on her.

The 2014 Fusion Hybrid does not live up to its mpg claims. AT ALL! Expect to see no higher than 34mpg from normal driving and 38mpg from "hybrid driving". 

Unlike the Prius which get its claimed mpg numbers when driven normally, the Fusion Hybrid will never get close to 47mpg unless all your drives are down hill, at 70F degrees, and no headwind.

The MyTouch system is a dog. It cant do anything without numerous inputs, and forget about the navigation, it is a true pain to use, so we don't and use our phones instead.

Just got my new Hybrid Titanium yesterday, and on my commute to work (45 miles one way) I averaged 46.4 MPG. With more practice, I'm shooting to top 50.
I've read all the complaints about how this car doesn't get the advertised 47 MPG, and what it comes down to is this: The folks who aren't getting the proper MPG are just not driving it correctly. They are heavy footed on the gas and brake - GUARANTEED. you have to ease on/off brake and gas with this thing, use cruise as much as possible, and work to maximize that EV mode. Other than the stellar mileage right off the bat, the car is quiet, smooth and incredibly comfortable.
