I've owned this car for a couple of weeks now and 700 mies.
So this is a first impression with 700 miles on the odometer.
The 5.0 convertible puts a smile on my face every time we go for a ride.
I love the retro styling (old enough to have seen it the first time) and the exahuast note with the top down.
Just took the first leg of a 140 mile trip and it performed flawlessly.
It is a base model GT convertible with M6 and 301A tech package, which includes SYNC.
For the trip with a little preplanning we managed to get everthing in the trunk for a 4 day trip (wife and myself) including a small cooler.


Would I buy it again?
Yes!!!
