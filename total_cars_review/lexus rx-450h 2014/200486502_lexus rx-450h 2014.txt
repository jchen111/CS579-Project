I see people here having concerns about gas mileage in the RXh and feel I might have some advice. 
I am on my second hybrid SUV from Lexus and also owned an LS.

The first thing lots of people do no seem to realize is that in order to extend your gas mileage in any car, including hybrids, YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT HEAVY FOOT OFF THE ACELERATOR! Driving faster than a maximum of 65 will diminish your mileage, also driving in hilly terrain, fast take-offs, your AC usage, incorrect tire pressure, and otherwise rough handling. In addition, you have to go into the RXs' information setting and reset the gas mileage monitor (usually after a fill up), to see the true mileage. Hope this helps.
