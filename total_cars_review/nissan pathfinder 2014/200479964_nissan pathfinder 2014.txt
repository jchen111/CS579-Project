This is the worst car I have ever owned. It has the shudder problem at 28 mph. Third time taking it in tomorrow. They say they cannot duplicate the problem so there is nothing wrong with it!! So frustrated with this car. Do not recommend anyone to buy this car.

We have the shudder problem at 20+- miles per hour and on our forth attempt at a repair the car has been in the shop now for seven days and they are still waiting on parts ????? . I will post again when I get the car back .

Bought a 2014 Model from Micheal Jordan Nissan in Durham, NC in Oct. 2013! Was told by sales person that the transmission "sudder" issue was fixed on the 2014's. At 1500 miles the sudder issue started happening at around 20 MPH. Took it back they said needed a new transmission. Work with Nissan corp. for 2 weeks and they would not give me a new vehicle or my money back!! Would anyne in their right mind want a brand new SUV with 1500 miles on it with the transmission already replace? DON'T THINK SO!! I'm stuck with this piece of crap because can't trade it and will lose $6000.00 on it and differently can't sell it. Nissan stinks and NEVER AGAIN will I buy another one!!! Honda or Toyota!!

So, far we've been very impressed with our SL Pathfinder.
The Tech Package seems like a worthwhile option with the Navigation as well as the Bose Waveguide system.
The SUV drives like a car; extremely smooth and capable.
Some reviews take a shot at the Pathfinder's V6 as being sluggish, but let me tell you, the car has no problems accelerating quickly up to 80mph when passing; its very responsive.
Front and back seat room is ample, and the cargo area isn't shabby either.
The leather seating and surfaces are soft, and supple.
I'm not a fan of some of the plastics used, but hey, its not an Infiniti.
Provided the car holds up mechanically, the Pathfinder will be ours for years to come.
