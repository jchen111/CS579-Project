Wife did not like seats in the '14 Focus SE, so we bought the basic Fusion S.  Very quiet, smooth ride, great gas mileage.  How great?  40.2 MPG on a 200 mile trip today (actual, computer said it was 38.2).  Like the room can comfort very much, a huge step up from my 2006 Focus ZX4-SES, 2.0L automatic.  And, the fuel economy is about 2 to 3 MPG better! 

Always used to be a GM man, till Obama Motors taking them out of the running.  Ford sure has improved.

I really thought I needed an SUV, but this car won me over. I have owned an older Fusion in the past that was ok. It's roomy yet gets great gas mileage. I average 32mpg highway and coming from larger vehicles that is awesome to me.

I bought the 2014 Ford Fusion S (2.5) in ruby red Metallic paint. Although new car search engines don't show the premium red on the S model, indeed it is available. I saved a lot over the SE but lack some of the SE bells and whistles like power front seat, and rear view camera. The only visible difference on the exterior is the rocker panels are black vinyl which works very well with the red. At 1500 miles we took a 2000 mile trip. I kept careful records of the mileage. It seems that the results were 35 mpg highway and 26 city. I was very pleased with the results with the 2.5 liter base engine. It had plenty of power driving over the mountains of West Virginia
The ride is incredibly smooth.

I LOVE my Fusion S w/ 2.5L 6spd auto.
I bought this car as an everyday driver to and from work 75 mi round trip.
I drive my 06 Mustang GT convertible for fun but for everything else this car is perfect and a great value, including impressing customers!
Smooth, Quiet, Attractive and 175hp when I need it.
I'm getting 38-41 MPG on highway, 30 in suburbs, 36 combined.

I purchased the S model Fusion.
My complaint has nothing to do with the car itself.
It's the owners manual.
Over half the manual is dedicated to SYNK.
In order to even use SYNK you have to purchase a plan separately which I do not need.
Therefore, for me, the manual is of little use.
I had to go to a separate web page to learn how to use what does come with my particular car.
Ford should have included more detail on what functions are standard (without having to buy other stuff for it to work) for the display and how they work with buttons on the steering wheel.
 On one Edmonds page it says I have tire pressure notification.
Well, I don't see that in the manual so I don't know.
