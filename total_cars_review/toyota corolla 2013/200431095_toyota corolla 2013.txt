Traded my 08 Corolla CE for the 2013 L because of a great deal at my favorite dealer.

Only thing I didn't like was the compulsory power windows and locks. Shame the pure base car is no more.

Love the Continental OEM tires. First good ones on my 3 Corollas. The Integrity tires on my first two were dumped before 10K for Michelins.

Do careful research and test driving and there really is only one option and no competitors. You simply cant find a car with the size comfort quietness and safety. Plus fuel economy is the same as the yaris and the echo before it except in town. Reliability... It's a toyota. Just change the oil and it will keep running forever. We live in our car and put about 800 km on it every week. I upgraded for the 2008 Yaris. It makes sense they dropped the Yaris sedan, for just a bit more you get a car you could live in with the same gas milage. Yaris had legendary dependably but it was a point A to B kinda car. 
To spend money on any other compact would be a a choice that is not based on facts.

I owned a 2011 Mazda 3, and my husband leased a 2010 4 door Yaris Sedan. We traded in the Yaris for a new lease on a Corolla. My husband now drives the 3 because it's financed and not leased as he puts a ton of miles on, and because my work commute is shorter I got the Corolla. My model has a moon roof, wood trimmed interior, heated seats, and other bells & whistles. Everyone says how much better the 3 performs, but I disagree, it's only a slight difference. I LOVED my 3, but I also love my Corolla. I also find the two tone beige interior of the Corolla to be nicer than the all black interior of the 3. The Corolla is a classy ride - mini Camry! The Yaris was a lousy car. Drove like a tin can
