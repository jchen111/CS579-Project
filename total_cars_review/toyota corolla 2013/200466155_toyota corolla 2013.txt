I bought my car brand new back in April 2013. I paid for leather and heated seat. Since I bought to car everything I drive it I have chronicle back pain. the discomfort is behind description. 
It was the biggest mistake of my life. In addition, the dealer where I bought the car was in my opinion, the worst of all.

Lets be honest, the interior of the corolla may be antiquated and the engine power may not be as responsive as some other competitors. That being said, this is a nice vehicle to have in your garage. I admire the Hyundai Elantra's styling for both the interior and exterior. When i test drove the Elantra everything felt good, but i did not feel the sense of longevity. The civic is also a great choice but to package up to the standards of the Corolla S, I might as well buy a Camry SE. The Corolla S is the best choice here. Everyone speaks about the appearance as boring but My Corolla Grabs eyes on the highway, and it looks similar to the 06-11 Camry S which was #1 in sells for its model years.
