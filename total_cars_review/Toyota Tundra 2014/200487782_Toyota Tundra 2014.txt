This truck is my third Tundra (2003, 2007, & 2014).
It is by far the BEST model Tundra thus far.
The upgrades to the new model refresh are long overdue.
The new Entune system is a welcome addition.
It makes it feel like a 21st century vehicle.
This time around, Ford and Chevy were strong contenders (sorry, I will never be a Chrysler/Dodge customer).
However, the big difference is long-term reliability AND trade-in value.
The overall performance, style, and mechanical prowess for the price is unbeatable.
