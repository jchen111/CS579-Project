I owned a 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo for about a month, and then traded it in. It had very little get up and go on the smallest of hills, it was so bad on gas that I might as well have gotten the V8 cause the fuel economy seemed to be about the same. It was difficult to get in and out of even with the added assist steps. This is the reason that the prior owner traded it. I disregarded that upon purchase because they were an older couple. I am young and it was still a pain to get in and out of with the kids. 
It is very stylish and eye catching. The 4x4 seems to perform well and the Jeep handled well. I loved the interior lighting. I traded it for a Chevy Cruze diesel and dont regret it

The JGC Trailhawk is a limited edition Laredo with exclusive features. It does have the 5.7 HEMI. There isn't anything that makes it drive differently than a regular Grand Cherokee. We found this rare Jeep on the dealer lot for $8000 off. What a deal! It has a really smooth ride from the air suspension. With rugged off-road tires, it still has a really quiet, smooth ride. The seats are big, but firm. However, they're really comfortable. Its cargo space is good for luggage even with the seats up. The interior is well-put together with high quality materials, and many are soft to the touch. We had 0 problems with the electronics, the engine, and the air suspension. We had it for 9 months.

Must admit, I was initially weary of jumping-in to the Jeep (i.e. Chrysler) family after reading a number of reviews over the years.
However, the overall design of the Grand Cherokee, plus the pricing and the engine performance, had me negotiating very hard for a lengthy extended warranty (I know some folks don't like purchasing extended warranties).

There were a couple of cosmetic things that needed to be fixed.
One of the exterior trims on the passenger window needed a new fastener, and there was something rolling-around underneath the passenger front seat.
Both items were taken care of.

I drive a lot of miles per year, usually 20k+.
One long trip was comfortable.

The worst car that I every bought in my 36 year driving career. I have talked four people out of getting this car already and will continue to do so. Not comfortable, little driver seat that feels like an oversized toddler car seat, dangerous to drive because of limited visibility through side rear windows, steering controls broke three times and the car does not stop quickly in the snow. I almost got into a accident this past winter because the car did not stop and I ran into an intersection. The price for the car is reasonable but you pay for what you get. I have not gotten any positive help from the Chrysler Corporate Office and they only "pass the buck." Stay away!!!
 Thank you.
