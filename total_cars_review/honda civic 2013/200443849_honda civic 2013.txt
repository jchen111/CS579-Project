I rack up a lot of mileage and I have kids to shuttle around so I need a car to be 100% reliable and inexpensive to run. I also think dealer service is a waste of money and the only service I perform on my cars is an oil change and tire rotation at whichever quick-lube joint I happen to be driving by when the maintenance minder goes on. I could drive a Toyota, but talk about bland. Civics are the perfect blend of sporty and economical, have great driving manners, good build quality and are more than powerful enough to appeal to most drivers. The 2013 is no exception, not to mention it's so classy and well equipped you really wonder how long people are going to waste money buying luxury cars.

When I bought my 2011 Civic, I'd test driven the 2012 and loved the way it drove but hated how cheap, plain and conservative the car had become, focusing on fuel economy above all else. So I bought the 2011 even though I found the transmission to be really unforgiving, because it was a much better made and more attractive car. The 2013 I just bought is a perfect compromise. Great transmission, sufficient power, excellent fuel economy, superb interior and exterior styling and quality. I don't like the seat fabric much, but the nylon mesh and faux suede seats in my 2011 were uncommonly high-end for this class of car. The 2013 Civic is a sincere apology for the poorly-executed 2012.

Bought the manual because I did not like how bad shifting felt in automatic.

 Pros:
mileage is insanely good - averaging about 37 combined with 75% highway and 25% around town (I drive pretty conservatively, highway is cruise control with econ button on).
Safety - was rear ended, not injured, car held up fine.
Fairly quiet and comfortable - good space for a smaller car.


Cons:
It was relatively cheap and it feels cheap.
I had a VW golf before this and it felt like a tank in comparison (mileage sucked).
The paint already has a chip after one month.
 And there is a sloshing sound that comes from the gas tank that is really noticeable if you have the radio off.
