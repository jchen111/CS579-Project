Bought new for daughter. FIRST ONE- Had to pull transmission at 162 miles. Gave me a new one and many small items. Scratch in dash. Dimples on back side of steering wheel, right where you grab the wheel to turn it ( looks like poor molding/manufacturing). Have never had the day(s)where I was like...love the car due to too many items. Wish had cash back.

I have a 2013 Honda Civic LX with a little over 10,000 miles on it now. Let me tell you, my average full economy in South Florida heat with use of Eco mode most of the time, is averaging between 30-31 per each tank. If I drive on long highway trips around 65pmg with ECO mode on, it averages around 44mpg, which is excellent! The only thing I don't like about ECO mode is that it is embarassingly slow off the line. While the A/C is slightly effected while in this mode, it doesn't seem weak, even with 89 degrees outside. It's a great car for the money. I wouldn't have done it any other way, just wish I had springed for the EX.

My 2006 Civic Ex was totaled in an accident two weeks ago. So I went to my nearest Honda dealership, where I bought my 2006, and bought a 2013. This is the third Civic I've owned and the fourth I've driven. It is such a great improvement over my 2006 Ex. The 2013 Lx has all the same features that I care about that were on my 2006 Ex. It has a very smooth, stable and quiet drive and handles easily. The rear camera is taking me a little while to get used to, but I see the necessity. The headrests on top of the front seats prevent a clear view out of the back window, especially for someone as short as I am -- 5'2-1/2". I have no problem with the braking quality.

Where to start this review. I must say, this car is a great value. It's quiet on the highway and in the city. So many little small features that you never expect. The i-MED screen is customizable and the headlights go off if you leave them on. Gas mileage is great. Eco mode does save you save gas while driving in the city, but at a expense of off-the-line acceleration. I love how the blinker you can tap and it does 3 blinks for you to change lanes. The headlights are great at night and the car handles great. I must say, I am still learning how to use all the features on this car. I have had it since March. I have achieved 43.7 mpg hwy on a 100 mile round trip, eco mode on. Handles GREAT!

I love this car.
I never thought I'd be driving a civic, but the 2013 model is such an unbelievable value that I couldn't pass it up.
I'm 46 and was looking for something safe and fuel efficient to get be to/from work.
After test driving several other cars, I took the civic for a spin and was blown away by all the standard features on the base model LX, as well as the comfort, style, and price.
Once I saw Honda's zero down, $230 per month for 35 months lease, it was a no brainer.
I actually negotiated a better deal since my credit is very good and I was a returning customer, but I would have gone with the zero down/$230 month every day of the week.
Get this car!

I really enjoy this car.
It's definitely saved me on gas with the econ feature. My old Elantra '01 would use up a full tank a week to get to work, with my Civic using econ I use 1/2 a tank a week. Only thing with econ is it drives a little slow going up hills and such, but that should be obvious because that's how it works. You can't hit the gas and take off, but I'm fine with that!

I drove it in the horrible road conditions from our last snow storm and while it was very bumpy from the poor plowing, I may have slid once or twice, where as other cars I watched were all over the road.

Some of the blind spots could take a while to adjust to.

The compact market doesnt have 2 or 3 clear cut winners anymore. Honda underestimated this when they designed the 2012 civic (which my wife owns). For someone like her, who just wants something that is painless to own and operate, and gets good mpg, its a great car. But for me, the improvements on the 2013 are a little more than subtle. the biggest and most obvious ones are with the new standard features and the interior quality. I never had a quiet honda until now. Its quieter than my buddies 2012 focus, which is something i'd never thought id be able to say. gotten nothing but compliments and it feels very germanic..more like my old golf than my previous civics

Love the interior and exterior quality. New civic has a comfortable ride and very good fuel efficiency.

Also like the fact that bluetooth and rear view camera are standard on all 2013 Civics.

However, in the second week after buying the car I didn't drive it for another week and the car wouldn't start. Turns out the battery was dead due to cold weather (around 10-20 deg F) After jump start everything was ok but for a new car this is quite unexpected. Will have to watch it going forward how it behaves....
