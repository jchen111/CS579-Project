I just purchased a new 2013 Civic Hybrid. The
vehicle only has 500 miles on it so far, so there isn't much to tell yet.
Averaging 44.5 mpg, which is a little less than my 2003 model, but definitely acceptable.
Color is supposed to be green opal metallic, but it just looks blue to me.
I'm a little unsure of all the electronics on the new model.
In general, our electronic gadgets only last a couple of years, and I expect to drive this car for much longer than that. I'm concerned that Electronic components in a vehicle can be VERY expensive to replace.
