I got the Green Opal one 2 weeks ago.
I now have about 500 miles on the car, and it came with 106.
It was the only one available in the Tri-state area that was equipped as I wanted!
It drives so nice and smoothly and I enjoy the great technology upgrade from the 2005 I sold in order to get this car.
The Winter mpg change from the 2005 HCH to the new one, is pretty significant.
I was told to keep the Econ button on all of the time to get the best mileage.
If you are expecting a Green car, you will be surprised by the color changes the metallic paint makes.
There are times the car looks light blue, blue/green. and an almost sea foam green.
 This is all dependent on the lighting!
