i had a '03 civic ex with 131k miles and for 10 yrs, it was nearly perfect. in its 11th year it was showing its age just a little. i think i got spoiled at not having to put money into it, outside of regular maintenance.

anyway, i figured almost 11 yrs was a pretty good run and honda had 0.9% for *60* months, which is rare for honda. also, the 2013 got really good reviews as a bounce back from a semi-disappointing 2012 model.

the comfort of the seats (tho i've read some complaints) and the road noise is MUCH improved from my '03 model, aswell, imo. the technology made a big jump, too. i hope the reliability continues. my former civic was the best car i've owned, BY FAR.

The car is beautiful. Do not get 40 MPG hwy as was told by dealer. Does not handle well in snow. Good fast heater. Visors are lower quality than my 2008 same model. Also center armrest in back seat is narrower. Car hesitates when turned on. Also hesitates when accelerated from a dead stop. My 2008 just went. This car drags. 2008 more peppy and more fun to drive. Same model

2013 Civic is a Beautiful vehicle.

Your review of the Honda Civic Ex sedan automatic mpg. It is false and so far presentation of the information is at best misleading in the state of California. I have almost 5,000 miles on a 2013 Honda Civic EX and I have yet to average 29 miles city and highway. I have used the car's on board computer which seems to inflate the actual mpg and then manual calculations of what I filled the tank in number of gallons to cross check. While like the civic my main reason for buying the gas only verse hybrid model was that the gas model was supposed to get 38 mpg. When I asked the Honda sales and service folks what was going on I was getting mixed messages. One, wait until the engine is broken in.

I just leased a 2013 Honda Civic Coupe EX, and so far I'm loving it! Now, to be fair, I upgraded from a 2000 Ford Focus LX with manual everything, so being enthusiastic about a new car wasn't a very tall order. I probably would have been just as happy with a new Yugo if there still was such a thing. But overall, I love the body style and interior design of the Coupe EX. The dash is laid out very well and all the controls are within easy reach. The ONLY potential downside I see is the quality of the cloth seats...I'm just not sure how long that fabric is going to keep looking good. Handles very well, and is a nice smooth, quiet ride. Pretty good stereo system too with the 7 speakers.
