Purchased this vehicle in June of 2014, Two months later the front end started to shimmy/wobble when accelerating from a stop or taking a corner from a stop. Took it to the dealer and they confirmed the problem and said they will replace both front axles as recommended by Star Case S1421000022 (not sure what that is). Axles replaced and it still does the same thing. Will return to dealer when the 1000 mile break-in period for the new axles is up.
Acceleration from a stop is not very responsive either.

I love my new Jeep Cherokee 4x4 Limited.
It is the 6 cylinder engine and has plenty of power.
It seemed a little on the expensive side at the time of purchase but now I couldn't be happier.
The fit and finish is great.
The leather interior looks rich.
I have the blue and brown leather.
The transmission is very smooth, and although it took some getting used to, I really like the design of the exterior.

I did a ton of research on SUV's - Ford, Toyota, Mazda, Acura, Honda etc...and I initially leased the Grand Cherokee as I couldn't decide between the Cherokee and Grand Cherokee.
The first night I drove the Grand Cherokee home I hated it.
The dealership was awesome and let me switch to the Cherokee Limited V6 w/ Panoramic roof, loaded.
It is the best driving, most comfortable car with the best technology I ever had.
I am so happy with the purchase and love driving this fun car.
Perfect if you have kids yet want to drive in poor conditions yet want to go out at night or drive on the highway.
I completely recommend it.
