I drove a Jeep Cherokee as a teenager, and after the disappointing performance of my last vehicle, was excited to trade up. It is comfortable, performs well both schlepping me back and forth to work and tooling through the hills.  The technology features are a comfort when off the beaten path, and the panoramic roof brings all of the great outdoors in no matter what the season or weather. For once, I am excited about traveling back and forth between Idaho and Montana this winter.

In for my second transmission @ 12,000 miles on my new 2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude V6. They have had my car for over a week now and still don't know when they will have a new transmission to install.

Most amazing car!!! I cannot convey to you how amazing this car is. It is perfect for everything. I use it driving to work and get 28-30 to the gallon on mixed roads with hills. 24-26 In town. And up to 36 on the highway but usually 32 on a trip. Millions of features and you can customize your dash. Tons of room. most comfortable seats since my 1991 chrysler new yorker. I am telling you this is SO worth it. The remote start and heated seats in cold weather is the best. Heated cloth seats was the best invention ever!!! Yes brand new so there will be problems. Not only brand new car but brand new model. My fog light sticks on, but dealer will fix it. I love this car it is the best investment.

bought w/ 2 miles on it, 2nd day wouldn't start, been in the shop 6 times & towed once, transmission malfunctioned the ck engine brake & esc light came on then rolled forward down the driveway in reverse, it said service transmission & needed computer updates. when started it idles high then acts like its gonna die & smooth's out, taking off from stop it shimmy's from side to side. on the interstate with cruise @ 70 mph rpms are 2200 but plus or minus 1 mile the rpms drop to 1850, I resorted to video recording every time I got in it as evidence of trouble, have a active case with Jeep but if there is a issue and it doesn't throw a code its not fixable! but I did get a 6/60k free maint.

Well, I had such high hopes.

After an exhaustive search, I finally thought I had found the perfect vehicle for me in the new Jeep Cherokee.
But just after I crossed 2,000 miles the transmission died.

Yes, you read that right -- 2,000 miles.

I've now been without my Cherokee for a week and there is still no timeframe for when I will get it back (or even if they are going to fix it correctly).
Apparently, they "lost" the new transmission somewhere between the factory and the dealership.

It's really too bad, because there is a lot to like about the Cherokee.
But I guess I will be use the NC Lemon Law refund and buy something else that's more reliable.

Frustrating...

WORST, MOST HORRIFIC experience I've ever had! bought a new 2014 jeep Cherokee on 3/25 to have it in service 2x already cuz the engine is grinding &screeching when we accelerate, the trans knocks, & there is a clicking noise coming from behind the dash every time we shift. take the car to be looked at, told there is nothing wrong w/ the car (are you kidding me!?). have the same problems w/ the engine & back again on 5/17, have a tech acknowledge there is a problem w/ the engine, have the car in service for over a month waiting for this factory rep that came on 6/23, test drove the car, & said, "yes, this is normal. This is a new engine & its supposed to do that" (again, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!)

my wife & I wasn't fans of the front end design but all it took was a test drive to forget about that! it stickered $31,380 minus the rebate you CAN NOT go wrong it had the features we wanted & nothing we didn't. we traded our loaded challenger rallye sst and it beats that car in comfort and drivability alone! the dealership was 102 miles away we got 31 mpg, storage space is everywhere, the manual passenger seat is comfortable, the upgraded Uconnect 8.4a is user friendly not to mention the electronic dash, the gas gauge :( cant tell if its at 3/4 or 1/4 tank. BUT we've only had it 2 days and 3x's its had trouble starting not for sure why only got 165 miles on it. didn't like NO CD player.

Cherokee Latitude. V6, all the bell and whistles except sunroof. I bought this right before winter, and thank god for that because it was the worst winter of all time. This car had the most confident foul weather ride, and before this I had a tech loaded A4 and a 12' Wrangler. I remember having to ride up a 30% grade for at least 800 feet, and I hardly felt a slip. The car is a beast in the snow. The technology they put into the traction system has to rival some of the best SUV's on the market. Very pleased do far.

I purchased my Cherokee (V6, not 4-cyl) after owning an Outback and I love this vehicle! It's comfortable and fun to drive. Admittedly, I haven't had the car long (7 weeks), but to date, I have had no issues and would highly recommend the Cherokee to others. 
My husband and son are 6'2" and they both fit comfortably in the front seat and although they probably wouldn't enjoy a long trip in the back seat, there aren't many cars in which they would. However, we've had two adults in the back (5'10"+) who were both comfortable for a two hour trip with the front seats pushed all the way back.

I have 1400 miles on my Cherokee Latitude 4X4 4 cylinder and so far Im loving this vehicle. In comparison, my wife has a 2011 Honda CRV EX AWD, and it has also been a great car for our family. The Jeep feels more refined however. The 4 Cylinder is quite adequate if not more so. The transmission seems to be getting smoother as the vehicle breaks in. After a bit of lake effect snow in Michigan, it does awesome in bad weather-up to 15 inches of snow tested so far. Minor quirk is that the heating cooling always resets to hottest or coldest setting upon restart, and cargo area is smaller than our CRV. Otherwise I am very impressed with this vehicle. If it lasts it will be a great buy.
