I have had my Kia soul for a week and I love everything about it. I spent months researching
and at the end of my search I ended up disappointed because all the cars in the price range I was looking (under 25k) seemed boring and missing that certain something. I fell in love with the Range Rover Evoque (70k) because it comes with a completely black interior and a huge panoramic sunroof but I can't afford that and as I decided to settle, I heard about the new Soul with all it's goodies, panoramic sunroof and complete black interior, this car was not even on my list and after hearing so many awesome reviews I went to the Kia dealer and bought it that same day.

It was worth the wait.
