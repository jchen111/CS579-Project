We bought our newest Camry seven months ago, and have driven it 13,000 miles now.
This is our third Camry so we must like them.
The 2013 V6 is very fast.
The 2013 XLE seems lighter and more nimble than our 2002 XLE. The gas mileage is good and the car is definitely comfortable.
The steering is quicker than prior models, and this model feels better balanced than prior year models too.
Overall a fantastic car to get from Point A to Point B in comfort and safety with attractive styling.

I have over 100,000 miles on mine and I don't want to part with it.
Pros are the reliability, the smooth V-6 on the highway, the visibility from the cabin, the ride on Primacy V-rated rubber, the mpg, the automatic a/c, the huge trunk, the cupholders.
Cons are the slab-sided styling, the electric window only being auto up/down on the driver's side, no memory seats, hmmm, that's about it.
Overall, the best beater back and forth to work car you could ever hope for.
It's not a Lexus, but who (besides my wife) would use a Lexus for a beater?

Have owned this car 8 months. Went with the Camry after driving some of the competition, as the Camry was the best overall fit for me. Drove several versions of the 2013 Honda Accord sedan, but the sound system, radio and navigation system in the Accords are having major problems with the navigation locking up, radio pre-sets failing and the sound is just not up to par with other sedans. Stayed with the V6 and am averaging 33-34 mpg on the highway. The blind spot monitor is so very practical and works perfectly. The 2013 Toyota Camry is a well designed and implemented package - it does everything well; drivability, comfort, technology, mpg and ergonomics. Toyota gets a A+ on this one.
