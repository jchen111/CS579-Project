I got a new 2014 Mustang GT/CS with the 6-speed manual transmission. The power of this car is amazing. I got the navigation package with the heated mirrors and pony lamps on it. If I keep my foot out of it, the gas mileage is not bad. I have been getting 23-24 in mixed driving and 25.5 when not having to run the AC.
The car rides much better than expected. Driving it 4 hours for a trip to the beach was every bit as comfortable as riding in my wife's Honda Accord. I like the retro look of the 2014 better than the more modern look of the new 2015. Ford did a great job in the design of the 2014.

Just upgraded my '03 GT to the 2014 GT.
What a difference.
The HP and ride is amazing.
Bought one fully loaded with 6-speed, Nav, leather, & GT track pack.
I have loved Mustangs since my 1965 in high school.
I'm now 58 and like this one the best.
Smile on your face every time you get in.
Ford has really outdone themselves at this price range.
$3000 rebates help.
Not a fan of the '15 yet that is why I grabbed this one.
Sterling Gray color with black leather.

I made the mistake of test driving the GT after owning an older V6 mustang. Night and day difference in terms of performance. Without trying you can get your pulse up in just a sec. Not just a straight line car though. Very tight and handles great through the turns. Wasn't looking for the premium package, but the refinement was quite nice. Very comfortable leather seats and nice materials throughout. Gave what I thought was a long shot offer to the dealer and they accepted without even countering. Very pleased with several thousand off MSRP with one of the first 2014s out of the factory. Great fun to drive, plus I can still get around 25 mpg on the highway. Looking forward to driving more.
