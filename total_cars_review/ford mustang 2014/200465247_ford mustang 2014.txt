After taking my time and driving all manner of "budget" performance cars, I've purchased a brand new '14 GT, $0 in options. No auto trans, no apps, no nothing. V8 with 3 pedals. Bluetooth would've been nice, but not for $1500. You can do better for way less. Cloth seats are great, sound is decent from stock radio. Stock radio reads data MP3 CDs, so if you're thinking of going stock radio don't be deterred because it lacks the USB input. Standard HID headlights and LED tail lights are awesome. The car handles bumps and turns well with stock suspension. If you need a 4 seat car, forget this. [non-permissible content removed].

Wanted something fun to drive without pretentiousness just good old fashion American muscle. Initially picked Ford because they didn't take the government handout and glad I did. This mustang GT with the trackpack and reverse sensors in race red color is simply outstanding. If I drive it the consciences way to maximize mileage I can achieve the advertised mpg....but with this fantastic motor I just can't resist the power, exhaust note and the fun. Sure the interior is just so-so and the radio it's mediocre but the exterior styling and powertrain are awesome. Thank you Ford.
