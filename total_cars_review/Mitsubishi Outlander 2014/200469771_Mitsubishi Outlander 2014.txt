Mitsubishi's price of around $26k w/100k warranty was what sealed the deal.
The MIVEC V6 is plenty powerful, especially since it only weighs as much as a midsized sedan(3500lb curb weight), despite what others may say.
It also sounds quite nice, but not overly noisy.

Have about 2000 miles now, and averaging 21-22 MPG's in 85% CITY driving.
You can do 30 MPG on the highway at 65-70mph, but I don't drive there often.
The 20/28 ratings are just about right.

Ride is compliant and very Japanese, but not luxurious....more sporty.
Handling is competent and fairly flat.
Cargo space very good, maybe not as wide as Pathfinder or Explorer.

I test drove several Mitsubishi cars and liked the way the car felt.
After driving the car for a week I was able to find a number of short comings.
The automatic transmission is unresponsive, traction control never engages in slippery conditions, loud road noise, and the car itself feels unrefined.
V6 engine has 224 hp at 6250 rpm, but power to weight ratio is 0.045 hp/lb.
The car is a bit too heavy at 5005 pounds.
My previous car was lighter at 4001 pounds and you can feel the difference.
This is my first Mitsubishi car, but I have been looking at them for 15 years.
A number of my friends owned Mitsubishi cars and were happy with them.

This is a lot of car for little money. Bells and whistles usually found on much more expensive cars/add on packages. Powerful but still fuel efficient V6 engine, sturdy frame, AWD, great ground clearance, high end features that really make a difference in safety and comfort (e.g. backup camera, dual zone AC, keyless entry and start). It will handle pretty much anything with ease, passengers, heavy cargo, towing, and challenging weather conditions or even off road. Fun to drive thanks to solid road feel, spacious interior, peppy engine and virtually no blind spots. After test driving Escape, Outback, Highlander and Pilot the Outlander feels like combining the best aspects of all of them.

Overall, Nice vehicle. Nice handling in city and has decent power with the V6. Very fast pick up on the highway. The V6 makes a nice growl when accelerating. Handles rough pavement like a charm. Good fuel consumption for a v6. It is about the same as my 4 cylinder rav4. Very good brake feel.
Very nice well laid out dash. Out of all the vehicles i tested drove, The forester xt, mazda cx-5 and the outlander GT was in the running. The forester seat was not supportive and the steering was too loose. The mazda was very good and my wife has one. I think the handling is slightly better than the outlander but
the powe of the outlander cannot be beaten . The Super allweel drive system is legendary.
