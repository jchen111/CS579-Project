Wish I could love my Subaru like the commercials all tout but they didn't have the lemon I have. I drive a lot and was happy with all aspects of the Outback until my transmission failed at 83,000 miles. Since the power train warranty covers only 60,000 miles (they must know something) the dealership said it would cost me $8500 to fix. Subaru of America said they would give me $1,000 towards the repair as a good will gesture (it took them a week to come up with that). No thanks! Now I have to buy a used one online and hope that's not a lemon either. Needless to say "I don't love my Subaru"!

Issues
Mileage! Don't know how they got a 27/30 EPA rating but I give it 24/27 - upsetting.
 I read they toyed with tranny to get more oomph on 2013 perhaps resulting in mileage loss.
Engine same but EPA would have to retest right?
Yes am lead foot but have noticed that even in slower traffic I only get a little over 27 at best.


Tranny noisy!
listen while test drive - if it doesn't bother you then it won't later.
Worst when engine cold.

Steering bit odd coming from mazda 6 - I wandered all over lane at first (you can find many reports on net of this) but now its OK/better.


Pros
Suspension/drive very good on road, AWD, Comfortable/Spacious interior, Bluetooth, Roof rack

This is the first Subaru I've ever purchased. My husband is 6'7" and when we saw the legroom of 43" we did not believe it would ever work;however he has plenty of leg room and head room (more than Tahoe, Yukon, Sequoia, etc) with way better gas mileage.
The gas mileage is right on target of 24.6 mpg with all mountain driving (very curvy with lots of hills).
The 4 cylinder is plenty enough power. We also live on a very steep dirt road and does very well. Have not gotten any snow yet, so not sure how will handle. Very impressed with features in "base model".
2nd row passengers (2- 3 year olds) have plenty room and love the cup holder between them.
