This is my third Honda Odyssey (don't ask me why).  My 2014 EX-L has the same problem with brake rotors warping every 12k miles. The driver's seat still lacks comfort for all-day driving ( I transport medical patients and run abt. 300 miles per day).

This new 8-speed transmission will probably cause a class-action lawsuit... it's not going to last.  Quite often when slowing for a stop light or other reason, and go to resume speed, the transmission acts like it does not know which gear to go into, and then finally goes into one with a thud!

Had the OEM Fog Lights added to the tune of $600... don't waste your money, they throw light the first 3 feet and then nothing!  Worthless.

This Ody replaced my 2003 Ody (I want to 2003 back!).  I am very displeased with our 2014 Odyssey's shifting.  Acceleration/deceleration is not smooth.  This has nothing to do with ECO mode.  I did not notice this issue on the test drive (should have done extensive city driving).  The overall design of the van is nice, but had I foreseen the transmission issues, I would never have bought it.  I could shoot myself for not buying the Sienna (which I had driven [not by choice] as a rental several times).  I kept telling myself the Sienna's interior and features are not as nice.  But annoying transmissions are far worse of an issue; definitely not worth the extra 2 miles per gallon!

Let's first start by saying that for the last 10 years we have driven an '05 Pontiac Montana SV6 that by far was the worst piece of garbage that any one could ever be forced to drive. It is
sitting in our yard with a remote possibility that anyone will ever take it away, even for free.Worthless! 
We were able to purchase our new Odyssey at a Honda discounted price with amazing finance rate. ,one of the reasons we chose this over the Toyota Sienna.($4000+ in savings) So far the van has gone far beyond our expectations as far as quality.A few issues that are mentioned later. Runs great on the highway, although we have only been on a few trips with it.

I just bought a new 2014 Odyssey. Got it home, and realized that the width of the vehicle, with the mirrors at normal driving position, did not fit in my garage (width of 92 inches). The website states the width is 79.2 inches, regardless of the style. But this measurement doesn't account for the mirrors. The REAL width of the car is about 92.5 inches, so in order to fit the car into a normal size garage opening, you have to pull one of the mirrors in before you enter the garage door entryway. Not a very good start and no one realizes this when you start looking. I measured my garage before starting to look, but never thought the Honda or Edmunds web sites would be incorrect.

We only have two kids and still chose this minivan after a TON of research. Overall, I'm very happy with the van and it was probably the best choice. That being said, I sometimes wish I would have gotten something way more exciting -- but that's not really where my life is at the moment. When I drive by myself, it's zero fun. When the van is full, it feels right for our family. Considering the other options out there including a plethora of SUVs, this is a solid choice and the best one out there. 

It's easy; sliding doors, plenty of room, well laid-out for the most part, mellow drive. If I had three kids, I don't think I'd look at anything else. It's a perfect beach/surfing vehicle.

Just got my Odyssey a little bit ago and I really like it.
The tech features are nice especially pandora and the text on-screen.
It's very quiet and handles good.
Plenty of space in it for kids and gear.
Does handle like a minivan as expected.
Make sure you get the Michelin tires rather than the continentals.
There is a big difference and trust me the Contis are horrible.
The best bang for you buck is the EX-L in my opinion.
My kids use iPads and iPhones and have no need for a rear entertainment system.
Nav would be nice, but I use my phone for that stuff on the fly.
The one thing I will be keeping track of is the Tranny.
Had an Accord with Tranny issues and hoping honda fixed it!

We have 3 kids and all in car seats.
This van has enough room for all three in the second row and the middle seat pulls forward-way better than the Sienna.
Roomy and a lot of neat functions.
Best safety rating of all vans.
Averaging between 23-24 MPG.

I took delivery of my 2014 Odyssey EX-L just a couple of weeks ago and already regret my purchase.
I had previously owned 2 Odyssey's that were great but this 2014 is a huge disappointment.
The ride is very stiff and reminds me of the 1991 Ford Explorer that rode so bad if gave me neck and shoulder pain.
This Odyssey already has rattles and the OEM Continental tires suck in snowy northern Indiana.
If somebody has a PHD in computers (or a 10 year old grandson) the instrument panel is then probably understandable to program, but for a "60 something" it's WAY too confusing, plus the instruction manual is literally as thick as a Bible.
I wish I had my old van back!

Our 2001 Chrysler T&C tranny died, so we shopped for a new vehicle.
We test drove and thoroughly inspected the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna and were open to buying either.
While we loved the roominess, front seats, ease of steering and quick acceleration in the Sienna. We liked the ease of use, electronics layout and smarter features on the Odyssey better.
Both are excellent cars.
Sienna is roomier but hard to figure out the controls on the tiny screen and to move the 2nd row seats - 3rd row is cramped for adults. The Odyssey has good use of space and better electronics layout, easier to operate seats and gadgets, and seems sportier to drive on the Odyssey. Love our new 2014 Odyssey.
