Honda Odyssey Elite 2014, the top of the line Honda model, one which do not require additional purchases, has a flaw that detracts all positives, and apparently will not be acknowledged by Honda and its dealers. Purchased the vehicle brand new with very few miles. Upon driving the vehicle home for the first time, we noticed a very annoying sound coming from the front of the vehicle, anywhere from the windshield area, to sunroof, we yet do not know. Once the vehicle reaches freeway speeds of 70 plus this death rattle takes over. 3 times at dealership, resealing of windshield each time, but the noise persists. Call Honda, the feel nothing is wrong. Check forums regarding ugly noise.

After driving my van for 6 months now, and several long trips with the grand kids, the 8 passenger seating and 26 mpg rating are the only good things I can say about this purchase.
This is the first Honda I have ever owned, and if this is the top of the line product for them, it will probably be the last.
The electronic technology is old and outdated.
The Navigation system is worthless.
The entertainment system is also not up to par.
The COOL box has proven to be worthless for keeping things cold and has turned out to be just another storage box.
The alarm and remote start are a joke.
Overall this van has not lived up to my expectations and IÂm very disappointed with this Honda.

Had a 2011 Sienna limited FWD. Traded for 2014 Odyssey with high expectations due to better safety ratings, blind spot and lane departure warning, and so claimed better MPG up to 28 MPG on hwy. After having owned and driven both cars, realized each has plus and minus features. If you use navigation often, this would not be ideal car (see below). Cargo area a bit smaller than Sienna, though 3rd row more spacious.
