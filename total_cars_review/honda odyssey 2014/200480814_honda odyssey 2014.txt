We enjoy the stable roadabiity, quietness, comfortable, supportive seats, roominess, smooth quiet engine.
So far, (3700 miles), no squeaks or rattles.
Several minor negatives: the ride is a bit "truck like" (not real "supple), and the dash controls are not" intuitive" - took us quite a while to learn how to program things, work the a/c, etc., as the knobs and buttons are not in expected places, nor do they perform the function I expected.
We finally have it figured out, but even the huge owners manual lacked "how to" information that produced quick understanding.
Gas mileage on a trip at 65 mph often about 30.
Even around town usually over 20.
V-6 has ample power. Overall, we love it.
