2nd honda odyssey.  1st was an 08 and it was great.  Our 2014 on the other hand has 20000 miles on it and has had the rotors turned 3 times.  Not replaced because that's not what the honda specs say to do so they grind them down.  It also has a clunk in the front end.  I called honda and they suggested the brakes got hot from riding them.  The regional rep didn't seem to care and waived the resurfacing cost since the brakes are now out of warranty.  No explaining why our 2008 didn't have that problem.  We paid more so we could have a good vehicle and that doesn't seem to be the case.  We even drive 2 hours to a certified dealer.  I will trade very soon.

I had an 09 Odyssey that I traded in for a Dodge product- worst mistake ever! Ended up trading the Dodge in for this one. 

The 14 is so much better than even the 09. The 6 speed tranny is now standard which bumped up MPG and the drive. The 3rd row seats also fold down much easier. 

The dual screens are a unique touch which I like. HondaLink is kind of a joke at this point (downloaded the app on my I-Phone) but I do like that the car will read you text messages and let you respond while driving. 

I looked at other vans but no one was even close to the Odyssey when all is considered. 

Note: The CoolBox does NOT make things cold, it uses the car A/C to keep things cold.

I did it all -- Edmunds, Consumer Reports, NHTSA, other buyers, Toyota, Chrysler/Dodge, Nissan, Ford Flex -- NONE compared to the Odyssey EX-L.
Add the RES (DVD system) for $1400 more and it becomes a no brainer.

 Odysessy rides better than the rest.
It is quieter, best gas mileage, and Honda plastic is superior to all others, even nudges out the Toyota.


 You must test drive each, look at the features/cost, resale value, trade-in values, financing options, and hands-on inspection.


 I chose the Odyessy over the Toyota as costs were similar.
I chose it over the Chrysler because of the difference in features, quality of materials, road noise, looks, reliability, resale, etc.
