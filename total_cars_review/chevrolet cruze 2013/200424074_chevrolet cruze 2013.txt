Everything has been great about the car, until I got the first oil change.
After the oil change and my 20min drive home, there was an awful smell coming into the car from the heat vents.
I thought they spilled oil on something. It went away and then came back about a week later.
Took it in to have them look at it and they found nothing.
Now the smell is back again and I am having them keep it over night and figure out what the smell is.
It no longer is as strong, but there is a faint smell of chemical coming in, and I don't need my kids or myself smelling this when the winter is so cold.

Bought brand new.
Have it for over two months so far.
Great little car.
Would highly recommend it to others.
Small car, yes, but, if you want more room, buy a Malibu.
I bought the Eco model and it has not dissapointed in any way.
