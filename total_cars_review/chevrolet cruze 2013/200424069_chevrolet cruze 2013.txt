My wife and I have been driving cars for 45+ years. Until 2013, we had not bought a Chev for well over 25 years. Before buying a Cruze, we had an Elantra, a Focus, a Volks Golf, and a Dodge Caravan (to name the last 4). We test drove the Elantra, the Focus, Mazda and Toyota, and decided on the Cruze 6 speed standard. We have not been disappointed 10 months later, and have put approx. 20,000 miles on the car to date, with no problem to date.

I wish someone would have warned me about this car!
I have completely babied this car never really drove it that hard, accelerate slowly, decelerate slowly. 

First you have to know the MPG is completely false!
DO NOT believe anything you hear.
 When I do the real MPG test and don't go by the computer, the computer tells me i get 30-40 MPG but when I gas up, record my mileage, and then gas up again and divide the gallons into the mileage gone I ONLY get 24-25MPG and that is highway miles!!

There is not really a clear coat on the car so the paint chips VERY easily.
Expect the body to be chipped and badly worn down by 50-100k miles...
