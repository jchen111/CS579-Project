Bought my 2013 Cruze in Oct 2013.
No problems until yesterday - engine light came on, it's still in the shop so I can't comment on that now. Reasonable performance for an economy car, I have the convenience package, which has a car starter, bluetooth and backup sensors, which are indeed convenient. It idles rough at times, one back seat pocket-not good
Throttle response is terrible. Merging out on a highway can be challenging, doesn't have good punch at all.

After 13 months of ownership and 17,000 miles I am still thrilled with this car. It is definitely a kick to drive and the gas mileage while somewhat exaggerated by chevy and the bogus trip computer that always estimates mileage 3-5 mpg higher than actual, is still quite good at 30 city, 38 highway. BTW, in all fairness, those numbers are still higher than the EPA sticker. My car is a 2LT, not an ECO. I love the car. Get one for yourself.
