My 2014 Equinox is a fun vehicle to drive and has a good engine and gets good gas millage.
I have only had mine for a couple of months, but so far I have no complaints.
I recommend test driving this vehicle to see how well handling it is.
James Corlew Dealership in Clarksville, TN was very professional and the salesman Jarren Miller was the best and very helpful in helping us with this purchase.
