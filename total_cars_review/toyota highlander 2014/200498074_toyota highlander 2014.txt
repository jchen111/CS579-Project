I purchased the 2014 Highlander after months of researching the 3-row SUV market and test driving about 10 different vehicles. I loved the new vehicle when I first got it, comfortable, smooth, quiet, and fun to drive. It started having problems turning over to start a few days ago, now it won't start at all. I've had it for 6 weeks, less than 2000 miles. I turned off all the automatic dome lights, keep everything off when I turn it off and until I start it, music, A/C, EVERYTHING! I've never had so many problems with a vehicle starting, worst vehicle I have owned, if you want to pay over $30,000 for something to sit dead in the parking lot then buy this car!
