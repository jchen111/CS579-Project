Bought a Limited AWD to replace our old 05 Odyssey minivan.
Good looking vehicle especially in maroon with black interior.
We shopped Mazda and Honda (their products were dated) and Acura MDX (overpriced in my opinion).
Got out the door with the tech package for $38K.
Good value but at a cost.
The interior design is quite nice, but there is evidence of cost-cutting in the hard plastic materials below arm level, the fell of some of the switchgear, and in the carpet (it feels like trunk liner material).
It rides well, handles securely and has plenty of power when pushed, but it does drive "big" and the engine is coarse; the Odyssey's engine was stronger and sounded better.

We have a Volvo XC70, Honda Accord, Mustang. Added Highlander to get 7 seats. It's good, but suffers in comparison to the others.

Nice inside, but nothing like the Volvo. Drives fine, but not *fun* like the Accord, Mustang. It's an SUV, so it's doomed to be a lummox.

Front of car looks nice. Rear: odd!

JBL stereo: Sound was muddy, bad. Dealership clueless. I finally discovered, in an Entune menu that was *not* Audio, a setting for "surround sound." Changed it to "stereo." Was like a veil was lifted. Still, the sound seems all up in the dashboard -- you must slide the fader nearly all the way back to get sound from all around.

Overall: Competent, quiet, boring. That's Toyota!
