I have the XLE AWD and in its first 5000 miles the vehicle is all I could ask for. It is a pretty SUV, it is quiet, and it delivers good mileage. I have had four 4-Runners over the years and this truck trumps them all. We recently towed a boat into Canada and my truck was loaded with gear and friends and we got 20.7 mpg on the trip. I have the captain's chairs and that made for a very comfortable ride for the back seat boys. We took turns driving and to a man they all expressed the notion that it was a remarkable SUV.

I have owned this vehicle for about a month and a half now; Prox. 4000 miles. Bought the XLE over the LE Plus as the price difference was minimal as compared to some of the luxury upgrades that are standard with the XLE package; ie: Leather, heated seats, larger touch screen radio, moon roof, etc. My family also owns a 2011 Toyota Sienna with the limited trim package. The Highlander has a much more quiet ride, comfier seats, plenty of room in the 2nd & 3rd rows (I'm 6'-4") so I do not fit in most mid-size SUV's...

The 2014 Highlander XLE AWD does has what it takes to be successful. It has a decent pick up, not very sporty, but thats what you get when driving a big car. The best aspect of pick up is when you are merging in a freeway and it delivers. 
It has cool interiors and nice safety features (annoying to some). For e.g. you cannot set a route on the navigation unless the vehicle is at full stop. You can speak to the voice command to set the via route though. The voice needs some training. 
the ride is smooth and quieter than any other big car I have driven. the seats are very comfortable. The handling is nice and of course it has the Toyota reliability.

I purchased the 2014 Highlander after owning a 2006 model for eight years and 130K miles, with minimal problems.
The 2006 was a hybrid, and I miss the better MPG, but without a tax credit I couldn't justify the additional $12K (2014 hybrids only come in the highest trim levels).
I'm 6'3", and the new model is just enough bigger inside to sleep in comfortably with the second and third rows down.
I'm a conservative driver, and so far (1900 miles) I'm getting 20.6 mpg overall; when it's time for a tire change, Michelins with lower rolling resistance may add a mile or two.
The steering is more responsive than the previous model.

It has been a wonderful surprise in almost all areas.
We were able to get all the goodies we wanted at 10k less than some of the rivals we compared.
