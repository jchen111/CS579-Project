I test drove my new Accord for a few miles and everything felt fine.  I immediately felt lower back pain when driving the car home from the dealer.  After making daily adjustments to the seat, and trying different seat cushions and lumbar supports, I came to the disappointing conclusion I'll never be able to comfortably drive this car.

The driver's seat should be recalled to address the following issues:

1.  The metal plate in the lower seat back stabs into my back causing debilitating pain after a 15 minute ride.

2.  The active head restraints lean too far forward causing severe discomfort on my neck and back.

3.  The seats are far too firm, like sitting on cinder blocks.

I have never posted a review on anything in my 38 years on Earth, but I had to throw my thoughts on this car out there in the universe.
I purchased a 2014 Sport model with the 6 speed manual.
It is a comfortable, precise, economical, and believe it or not, for a family sedan it's a hoot to drive.
I will continue to purchase manual transmissions until they are phased out.
I must say that the shifter in this car is the best I've ever had the pleasure to row.
If Honda can only toss in a better sounding radio and a sunroof, I think it could create world peace.
If you can't drive stick you owe it to yourself to get out of your comfort zone.
It's that good.

I only have 1K miles on it.
I bought the Sport because it was one of the few vehicles that was offered in a Manual transmission, was fun to drive, had enough room in the rear seats for teenagers, and I could fit comfortably (6'3" and 210lbs). It is a lot of fun to drive - even with a good portion of my 60 mile round trip commute being in bumper-to-bumper traffic. Gear change and clutch is one of the best I have experienced - slightly behind my old Miata, but better than my prior Cayman.
It does not like to be rushed, however.

Handling is a surprise. Very taunt with little bodyroll, but will begin to understeer at the limits. The ride is perfect - firm, but soaks up all bumps.

Love the 6 speed manual transmission on this car... Drove the Mazda 3, Mazda 6 stick shifts and the transmission on this car is what helped me make the decision to go with the Accord. Probably the best manual trans out there. The Mazda 6 may look better than the Accord now but I was just worried whether I'd still like it in say 1 year. Many cars look real good at first but after a while not so interesting. Maybe Mazda won't be like that.
