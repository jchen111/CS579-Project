I had originally decided on the Mitsubishi Lancer, due to its selective AWD and its warranty. Upon making an appointment to purchase a Lancer I had a moment of second guessing and decided I would just go down to the local Subaru Dealer to look at some sticker prices. I found the sticker prices were the same for a Subaru Impreza Limited as it was going to be for a Lancer SE with more way more options installed on the Subaru. It also has an EPA rating of 7mpg more than the Mitsubishi. I went to the dealer a couple of days later to test drive the Impreza and was impressed by its features, handling, speed and build quality. Bought the undercoating and extended warranty, happy with my decision!
