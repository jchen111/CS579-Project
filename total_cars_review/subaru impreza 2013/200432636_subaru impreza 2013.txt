Was excited when we bought our 2012 Impreza Hatchback, BUT...we had the car for 25,000 miles and needed to bring it into the dealership 14 times for a check-oil light. Got the run around from the dealership...oil consumption was normal, they were going to change the brand of oil used, maybe the light was defective to just routinely topping it off. Ended up calling a lemon law lawyer who got me a $2500 settlement from Subaru and then I traded the car with equity on my loan. So, I ended up coming out alright, but I feel sorry for whoever ends up with my car or whoever buys the Impreza new. Don't do it
