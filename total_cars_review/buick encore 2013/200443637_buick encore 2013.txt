So far I love my Encore, it's the perfect size, attractive and plenty of power in the city.
I am not experiencing the in town mileage most are posting on here (23.5 mpg) but giving it a little break in time.
No complaints so far, although I am experiencing the same thumping noise in the front end another review on here mentions, and eventually gave the car back to GM ?
I highly recommend the Encore, and I get a ton of compliments on it.
