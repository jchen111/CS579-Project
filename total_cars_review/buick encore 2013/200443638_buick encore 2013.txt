I've had my Encore for about 2 weeks and have begun to have fun driving again. It's very manuverable in traffic and i can zip down the hwy if i want to. I think it looks stylish and not like the rest of the pack. While it's small I had no problem getting into it and I'm a very large person. I have arthritis and some of those higher vehicles just didn't work for me. Also My 77y/o mom can get in and out of this very easy too. I'm getting 24 MPG on my first 300 miles and it's the AWD model and it's city driving. It's had all the features that i was hoping for and more. And i could afford it. Since most adults now spend more time single than married this is the perfect vehicle for a single too!
