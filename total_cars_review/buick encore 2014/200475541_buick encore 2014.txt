2014 Buick Encore White perl. About $32,000 before tax for full fully loaded premium AWD 2014 incluing cargo net, organiser, cargo floor, floor mats etc.
I have driven it from Seattle to Los Angeles for a week mostly west coast 1 and 101 hwy.
Here is what I felt after driving over 1400 miles.

1. Very comfy riding experience, also thx to the noise reduction technology. Stylish exterior and cute design good for 20s 30s female driver.

2. Despite of small suv size, it is roomy inside for 4 ppl. Cargo space is little tight though.

3. No problem merging hwy; however, no confident following another suv up on the mountain hills. I felt little embarrassing.
