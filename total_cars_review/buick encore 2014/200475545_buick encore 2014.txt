I have Encore base for 7 months and it has about 6K miles now. It is a comfortable car, but all positives ends here. Performance is mediocre. Driving it is a nightmare: I experience automatic transmission issues at times. Gears are switching erratically and incorrectly, the car is shaking. Dealer is reluctant to do anything: they just cannot duplicate the problem. Build quality is horrible: I did have a problem with shock absorber, it took me 4 visits to dealer to fix it. Do not buy this car under any circumstances!
