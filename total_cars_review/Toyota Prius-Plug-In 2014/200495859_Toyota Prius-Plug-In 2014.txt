Has all the Prius pro's and con's.
Pro's include excellent packaging, fuel economy, and tech features and drivetrain.
Con's include slow acceleration, cheap
and easy to scratch interior parts, built to save weight which means less sound deadening.
But Toyota is offering $4,000 rebate, 0% financing for 60 months, $0 down and no payments for 90 days, and $2,500 federal tax rebate, and $1,500 California rebate (for CA residents).
So in the end, the car costs LESS than a comparably eqipped regular Prius 3.
In other words, you get all the Prius 3 features + heated seats + no wheel caps + the possibility of carpool stickers in CA + plug in capability + higher resale value FOR LESS MONEY.
