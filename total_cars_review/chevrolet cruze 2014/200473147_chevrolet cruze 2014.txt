Over the past 10 years have driven the Mazda 3, and some assorted european models overseas.
Test drove the Focus and the Cruze this go-round and like the Handling is superb, shifting (manual) is a breeze -- lot's of getup and go with the turbo.... great gas mileage.
Recommend getting some blind spot sticker mirrors for your side mirrors if you do a lot of city driving... they only cost 99 cents and help out a lot as the side mirrors aren't as big as the focus. 
Pros:
No road noise even at highway speeds.
5 star safety (10 airbags).
Comfortable, smooth ride all around (if you don't believe it read kelly blue book review).

CONS:
Brakes are not as tight as Ford.
immediately.
