I am 6' 3" tall and 240 lbs, and this car feels roomy and comfortable to me, but the seats are too hard!
The beam suspension is not as nice as independent suspension, but it handles well for a compact. Everything feels very solid and much higher quality than other compacts I have owned. One big issue for me is that when the doors are unlocked then so is the trunk and anyone on the street, or the valet, can open the trunk by just pressing a button on the lid. Also, there is no lock or latch on the gas lid. The premium pioneer stereo isn't that great. All of the sound seems to come out of the center speaker in the dash. My Bose SoundLink sounds better. Overall, I really like this car so far.

I purchased this 2014 Cruze in Sept. for one reason and one reason only - 38 mpg.
I'm not even getting 30.
The 6 speed auto transmission is clunky and herky jerky.
Every control is slow to respond.
No trunk release anywhere on the car, only on the key, and it won't work if it is in the ignition.
All in all this car is a HUGE disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone.

I bought this car for my wife. She didn't think that she would like a small car coming away from a Nissan Armada; let me tell you she was wrong, can't her out of it.

The car looks small in stature but interior has good spacing and a large trunk for a small vehicle.
The car handles very firm but is really fun and comfortable. We have owned an Audi A4 1.8 turbo a while back and it handles just like it, very predictable and hugs the road.
The ride is smooth and bumps are effortless.

The electronics inside the car are great for long trips or short work journeys. Let me be the first to admit we were going to opt out on the Mylink and the other, GET THEM YOU WONT REGRET IT!
