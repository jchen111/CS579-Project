i bought the ltz, which i thought everything would come standard on, i was sorry to learn if i wanted a sun roof or spoiler, that would be an extra charge, and they put these puny splash guards on the car and charge you 170 .00,for things that barely even do the job, yes the car has a lot of room, i have been getting 35 mph with just about all highway driving. the radio is not worth the price either, if you drive in highway traffic with the window down, you can barely hear what's on the radio, i have been a Chevy owner for 24 years, next car i get will not be a Chevy!!!

I recently traded my 2011 Camaro in for a 2014 Cruze.
I was trying to find a car that could save me on gas.
The Cruze was an easy pick for me, compared to other cars in its class.
I got the black granite metallic color, it really shines in the sun light.
I was looking at the Mazda 3 also when buying a new car.
I preferred the drive quality on the Cruze, the Mazda 3 had a lot of road noise for my taste.
I am actually liking the Cruze more than my Camaro.

My wife and I just purchased a 2014 Chevy Cruze Ltz. I have been a life long Chevy consumer and was looking for a compact to midsize car that was kind of sporty but dependable. After research, the Cruze was the car we were shooting for.

We went to our local Chevy dealer and requested to test drive the Cruze I saw on their website. It is a 2014 LTZ, with black exterior and interior with all the bells and whistles. The 18" wheels look good on this car. The interior is comfortable but the back seats are a little cramped.

The front dash and surrounding area is easily accessible.
