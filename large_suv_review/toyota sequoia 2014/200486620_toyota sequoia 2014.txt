Ok - I started with a much longer review, but ran out of space.
If you are looking for a car that will take you out of "mini-van world" and make you feel slightly cool and powerful, you found the right, over-priced vehicle for the masses. If, however, you are like me, and actually care about aesthetics, performance and amenities, you will be disappointed.
