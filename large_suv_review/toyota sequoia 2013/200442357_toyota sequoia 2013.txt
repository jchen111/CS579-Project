Replaced my 2006 Honda Odyssey with 2013 Sequoia Limited. Was looking for vehicle that would be roomy (have 3 small kids), safe, and solid performance (mainly acceleration, braking, and ride) - and the Sequoia does not disappoint.

Performance - the ride, acceleration and braking are all solid. While this is a large vehicle, it's very easy to drive for both myself and my wife.

Interior - the fit & finish on the Limited is very nice.
This vehicle is extremely quiet - didn't expect that coming from such a large SUV. 

All around excellent choice if you are looking to move up or out of a minivan.
