Nephew went to Qatar for a year (Army) and left the car with me.
Fun to drive, handles great, rides OK for what it is, mileage is good, good looking car...BUT...preparing the car for his return, after washing and waxing, I see the car has marks under the clear coat which will not come off.
I tried different waxes, buffing
with 3M Finesse...clear coat is ruined as far as I'm concerned.
I've seen this same defect on my 1996 Intrepid and my 2003 Dodge Ram.
It must the good old boys at Detroit using the cheap junk because my 2002 Honda (296000 miles) sits in the same driveway, and does NOT have these issues.
I'm glad we taxpayers just gave GM $10 billion to produce junk!!!
