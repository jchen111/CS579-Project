Problem 1:
When I first picked up the car it exhibited a loud creaking noise from bad front end bushings.
Problem 2:
Driver side weather-stripping kept falling down out of its channel.
Problem 3: After 5 months of ownership was a slight shuddering I thought was something with the motor. It would start at about 1400 rpms during acceleration.
Mechanic test drove the car saying it feels like its misfiring. BS, it had a bad tranny and four attempts later I got it back. Problem 4: Metallic sound from driver side rear. Lug nuts loose. Tightened myself. Sound gone.

I have wanted to get a Camaro since they started making them again in 2009 but when they came out the dealerships marked them up as high as $5000 above sticker. So I settled on a Mustang waiting for the price to get more reasonable. Since then the trans on the mustang went out after 4 years and I found a new 2013 2LS in Las Vegas that was below sticker price. Yes I bought it and found out it has true dual exhaust, 323 HP, 4 wheel independent suspension, and extremely FUN to drive. If your looking for a sports car for half the price of a Corvette, this is the way to go in style. If your looking for a Cadillac, Buy a Cadillac.

This car is full of flaws.
Many of them I noticed immediately on my drive home from the dealership.
First thing the next day I took the vehicle back for service and was told the car needed to be broke in.
Really ?
A clunky front end and steering wheel wobble needs to be broke in ?
This car was broke before I even bought it.
Is it normal for a car to stall / shut off after a hard left turn ?
The people servicing these vehicles are just as incompetent as those designing & building them.
I own 7 cars, and this one is by far the poorest quality with the worst service.
This vehicle is a typical GM S-Box, the only good things are the engine & transmission, rest is junk.
Buyer Beware !

I bought a 2001 1LS in April 11 from Terry Cullen Chevy in Morrow Georgia, and I just traded for a 2LS in April 13. Great remake of a classic Chevy muscle car. Rock solid no rattle body and chassis, stiff and taught, really good road car. LFX 323 horse power V6 gets the job done for me, brisk acceleration, strong pull from 55 mph till..........well, whatever. Comfy seats, Bluetooth, Sirius radio, CD, aux port, power locks windows trunk release, it has all the standard goodies you would want...........and this is a base model.
Never had a problem in 61,520 miles with my 2011, I am sure the 2013 is going to be the same!
