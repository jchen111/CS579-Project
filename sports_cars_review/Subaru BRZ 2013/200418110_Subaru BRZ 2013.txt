My wife wanted a sports car and we looked at a lot of different models but she fell in love with the BRZ.
It took a while to find one but we finally found one
in inventory in ATL that was not let in dealer stock and went in and put down a deposit.
We had drove the Scion version and it was OK but not great so we weren't sure if we would buy it when it came in. It was well worth the wait.
Drives much better that the FRS and quality of interior and the few upgraded options are great.
Great driving little car!
IF you can find one it's a great car.
