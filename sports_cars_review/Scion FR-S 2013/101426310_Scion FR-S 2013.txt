I was looking for a fun sporty car as my daily driver and after doing my research I decided to test drive the FR-S. It is the perfect car for me (I'm 23) it is fun, fast, and so far reliable. The gas milage is also pretty good. I just have two complaints the first one is that I wish there were volume controls on the steering wheel the second is I wish it was called the Toyota 86 (like the rest of the world) but other than those two things I love the car and would reccomend it to anyone!

I owned a 2006 Scion TC that I bought in 2007.
Loved that car and was searching the internet for more two door cars and the 2013 Scion FR-S came up and I was hooked.
I went to my Scion dealer here in Kahului on Maui , Hawaii on May 25th .
They told me the car would debut on June 1.
I had to wait a week!
June 1st, 2012 back to the dealer I went and three hours later I drove out with the "whiteout" color (not a good name for the color, it's a real pearl oyster white).
I use ethanol free gas right now and get 35 mpg.
 I just love the way it "gets out of the
way" of everyone else .
I did get the automatic and won't be using the snow mode.
And by the way I'm 67 yrs. old and LOVE my car
