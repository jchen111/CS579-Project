After previously having a total of 9 Camaros and Firebirds, I finally "defected" from GM to Ford and bought this Mustang, and I gotta tell you it's pretty awesome! And after coming straight from a problem-plagued technological-overkill-on-wheels BMW 335i, this car is quite a breath of fresh air by comparison. Sure it's a bit cruder in some spots, but at the end of the day there's nothing like an all-American convertible icon with a honking V8 engine and retro style and attitude that this car has in spades.

V8 Engine smooth and fast, Car looks great but when I hand wash or it rains water gets in door sills, trunk wells, hood, leaks out of plastic around fog lights, and rear lights, front and rear bumper crevices. After 50 years you'd think Ford would have learned how to build this car tighter. At a Sticker Price with tax of over $50,000 they need

I got my 2013 GT Premium Convertible and have been surprised at how much I really like it.
I have never really been a fan of the newer (1980 forward) Mustang designs until I saw this one.
The new front and rear design is great.
The car turns and handles well, even with the solid rear axle; but not as well as the Mazda MX-5 which I upgraded from.
The 5.0 V-8 is powerful and responsive with the 6 speed manual and when you stomp on the pedal, it always brings a smile.
The upgraded Brembo brakes help a bunch and although you can feel that the car is heavy, it still is a load of fun to drive.
Plus the car turns a lot of heads

I've had my Mustang for a week, and I love it.
It has fantastic giddyup, pretty good mileage, and it looks better than anything else on the road.
The engine is swift and responsive, the SelectShift transmission is smooth, and I'm enjoying the Electronics package with Sync, Navigation and entertainment options.
