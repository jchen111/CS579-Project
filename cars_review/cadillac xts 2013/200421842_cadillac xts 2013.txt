We bought the
Platinum AWD in Diamond White. It's beautiful both inside and out. The safety features are awesome. The ride is wonderful. The CUE is absolutely fabulous. The XTS is truly a new chapter for Cadillac. This car will appeal to both the traditional Cadillac owner and the younger generation. All it needs is a V8.

We bought the platinum edition, liked the different grille and wheels. As the salesman was showing my wife how to operate all the features all of the sudden the radio went to full volume. The salesman tried to turn it down but as soon as he removed his finger from the button it would return to full volume. They said it needed a software update and took it to the shop. An hour later he returned and proceeded with the demonstration and it did it again, not only did the volume increase on its own you can't turn it off. Well today it is making its 3rd trip back for the same issue plus some other electronic problems such as the seat memory won't work, Bluetooth connection is often lost and so on.
