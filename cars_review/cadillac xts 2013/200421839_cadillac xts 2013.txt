I love to drive this car.
It is just the right size to give comfort while being small enough to be able to maneuver.
The vehicle is great.
The CUE electronics are horrible, however.
Why is it that some engineer decided that a sleek touch pad appearance trumped function?
I have learned, after difficulty with the touch, that the system (like an Ipad) does not respond well to fingertip touch but instead needed a finger pad touch.
Okay on an Ipad, but awkward at best while driving.
Certain things, like climate control and radio controls, just are easier with knobs. Also, voice recognition is terrible.
I was told the noise canceling system interferes.

purchased 2013 xts premium 500 miles ago, so far so good.
inside all materials are of premium quality.
cue system was a little tough, now very user friendly, very quiet and stable ride, and i feel it has plenty of power, i don't see where you would need more performance.
it really gets up and goes, and am getting 28-30 mpg highway.
have had many new vehicles in past 5 years, and this is as good or better than any hi line import vehicle including mercedes or audi.
technology is far better than any, and the price for what it is, is a real bargain hands down.
if you are looking for a great deal best car in the segment, drove all competitors.

9 trips back to the dealer since July. The cue system seams to have problems that GM doesn't have fixes for, they should have worked all the gremlins out of the system before releasing this car.

I have a very bad back so I always drive a big heavy car. The XTS has coach work 2nd to none. The problem is I've had the car back to the dealer nine times. Service is supposed to be available at your preferred dealer. But if you have a legitimate problem, and the dealer doesn't have a fix they will blow you off because you aren't going to give them a perfect survey. I'm currently on my 3rd dealer. Getting Cadillac involved doesn't help they tell you dealers can refuse service if they choose to. I bought my car in July, and to date the vehicle will unlock the doors at least 25% of the time. When you are trying to get out the power seats, and mirrors will start moving. No heat, at times. Bad

I like to wait until I have driven a new car for a thousand miles before I review it.
I must say that this car is a dreamboat!
It has been written about as the new definition of the American luxury car, and I think that that is apt.
It is not an attempt at a European or Japanese clone.
It's its own thing, and I like it a lot.
It's big enough to feel luxurious but not so big it feels clunky on the road.
It's great to drive. I traded my 2012 BMW X5 for this ( I hated the electronic shifter in the BMW) and before that I had a Lexus LS460.
I like this Cadillac far better than either of these.

Purchased a White Diamond exterior with Carmel/Black interior Premium FWD XTS in July after considering a BMW or Mercedes.
After 3,300 miles in it, the more I drive it the more I love it. Outstanding ride quality and interior finish is top notch.
So glad Cadillac did not abandon the smooth ride to chase the BMW/Mercedes performance (extremely hard ride) model.
This car provides a perfect blend of cushion & performance handling.
Big car ride with midsize handling.
The spirited V6 provides excellent power while returning great gas mileage.
CUE system definitely requires a dedicated learning period to familiarize yourself with the many features.

I leased a new xts with the premium trim pkg today in black on black and what a gorgeous car it is
