Purchased new in Ohio while on vacation and drove back to Las Vegas.
Averaged 28 MPG for the entire trip and was impressed with the long range comfort and handling.
It won't burn off the 20" tires but lots more available acceleration than what was needed.
All of the interior appointments are top quality and once you get used to the electronics, easy to adjust through the CUE system.
After three months, had glove box closure issue and the dealer just replaced the entire mechanical and electronic component to repair.

I took delivery of my XTS Platinum FWD in Sapphire Blue Metallic on May 11.
I must say that I become more pleased with the vehicle everyday.
I have owned a Lexus LS, a Jaguar XJ and a Mercedes CLS and the XTS compares very favorably with each of those luxury vehicles.
GM has finally met the challenge of the German and Japanese luxury vehicles with interior materials, fit and finish and technology second to none.
I seriously evaluated 11 other cars and SUVs before this purchase and could not escape from the fact that dollar for dollar the XTS was the best value in its class.
It is a pleasure to drive, performs beautifully and has that head-turning quotient.

I recently purchased the new Cadillac XTS and was completely thrilled!!, I had been waiting for the release of this vehicle for quite some time now and was glad to see it was finally released. I had been working through one of Cadillacs finest representatives (Mr. Chris Ferren at Crestview Cadillac), who had been working on this vehicle with me for several months, Chris was very diligent in keeping me posted on the XTS and periodically sent me supportive media to help me make my final decision. Finally, Chris actually brought the vehicle to my residence (can you believe that!) we then finished the paperwork and spent several hours going through the details of the XTS such that I could get completely familiar with all the new gadgets. Chris is an excellent person to work with and I highly recommend him to anyone that is in the market to purchase a new Cadillac, regardless of the make or model, hell definitely do a great job for you.
