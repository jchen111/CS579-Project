This is the most uncomfortable full size Cadillac I have ever owned.
The ride is stiff and hard and the seats are not comfortable.
I owned four large Cadillacs previously which I really enjoyed.
This new XTS is terrible.
I will ever buy another Cadillac.
Ergonomics need much improvement.
The CUE system is cumbersome and you must take your eyes off the road too frequently.
