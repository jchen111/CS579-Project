after sitting for 4-6 days the battery goes completely dead. dealer says nothing wrong . after returning from a 7 day vacation the battery goes completely dead. I have no faith in this car and am afraid to park for a few days . the dealer charges the battery, I could do that. gm is still the leader in unreliability ,don't buy this car until they come up with a fix for the cue. I believe this is a lemon
