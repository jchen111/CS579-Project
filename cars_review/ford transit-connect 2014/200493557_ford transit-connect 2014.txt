I just bought the fully loaded Transit Connect Titanium model last week.
So far I am really enjoying it.
I went from a lnfiniti FX35 so I was a bit hesitant to make such a drastic change at first but the more I drive it the happier I am with my choice.
I had been in Italy this summer and rode in a more striped down version.
That was roomy and able to carry 7 full sized adults on our various adventures. I had never considered getting one for myself but after looking at the Flex, Explorer, and the MKT, frankly, this really fit my needs the best.


This had the fuel efficiency, tech goodies, AND hauling room!
Plenty of room for taking my paintings places.
No need to rent a van!
