Just traded in my 08 cadillac CTS on this new 2014 IS350 AWD.
I have been a GM guy all my life and decided to go with my first import car.
I looked at BMW, Audi, Ford Fusion and a few others.
If you are looking for a true sport sedan, look else were.
This is more luxury than sport. It has a very comfortable interior and perfectly laid out.
 It does handle great and has very impressive performance.
I still think BMW does handle a little better.
Audi was a little too stiff riding but had a lush interior.
But Lexus fit all my requirements this time.
I have only owned it for a couple months, so far, so good.
I hope it's reliable as they say.

The performance is impressive coming from a V6 and it is so comfortable for a small sports car. The interior isn't bad at all it is like being in a modern art museum! The mouse on the dashboard is extremely helpful. I could look up traffic alerts and it automatically changes my route so I don't have to go into heavy traffic. I would prefer this to any Audi.
