First off the review that says the seats are hard and uncomfortable.......either that's a fake review or the person is demented.
A Corolla....really?

The seats in Jetta are superb.
Been on 3 hour drives and they are simply great and supportive.
The extended and height adjustable armrest is a great idea too.

The 1.8t is noticeably better in all aspects compared to the 2.5....smoother, faster, better mpgs.

Car handles great, rides like a dream, and soaks up the bumps well.
Averaging 25-27mpg in mixed driving.

Got mine for about 3K under sticker so it was around 19K before tax.
Drives like a much more expensive car.

Picked up the car just before Thanksgiving. Covered 800 miles thus far. Handles well, but not a sports car. Has that 'tight' feeling of quality that German cars are often described as having. New turbo motor & the return of the independent rear suspension is the main reason I selected the Jetta over a '14 Mazda 6. The power of the new motor works well being mated to the auto trans. 
Engine is extremely smooth and revs freely. Transmission is quick to up-shift in pursuit of MPG's, but also downshifts quickly if you need to pick up the pace. 
Interior is clean with simple controls. Heated seats have been handy with the vinyl seats and the cold temps in my neck of the woods.

I leased my 2014 Jetta SE with Connectivity in November 2013. I was a long time Toyota Customer and was always happy. I was previously in a 2011 Toyota Camry, but wanted to reduce payment & insurance cost. I also wanted increase gas mileage without sac. room. Toy. gave a high lease price for 2014 Corolla.This caused me to look elsewhere.After test driving much of the compact segment,this Jetta Blew me away.I leased during the "sign then drive event" so I was able to get into to this vehicle which was a much higher equipped vehicle then all others I test drove.(IE.Cruze,Corolla.)For a lower lease price. The 170 HP TSI and 6 spd.Trans. are fantastic!Great Gas mileage 2.You'll Love it!-SE&above
