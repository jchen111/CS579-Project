Seats are and well shaped and comfortable for about 15 minutes, then you realize they are too hard and fatigue and soreness begins to set in.
 Road noise is prominent so between the noise and hard seats, the car is not one you look forward to driving long distances.
The 2013 Corolla is considerably better for longer trips.
I have not driven the resigned 2014 Corolla to see if it is still comfortable on long trips.

Another undesirable feature of the Jetta is that the effort required to activate the power windows is very high.
I've never experienced that in an American or Asian car.

To start with, and in full disclosure I rated my new 2014 Jetta S with the 6-speed automatic with many 5 stars as I feel the professional test drivers who put out review video's and write professional reviews for a living are not really representing the average American on what they are truly looking for in a car. Who really wants or needs a 300 horsepower four door sedan that does 0-60 in five seconds. Look to a Corvette for that. Who really wants and needs soft leather on the dash and full interior. Look to a Lexus for that. 

Volkswagen should not be overlooked for several reasons including build quality, safety, handling, and tons of interior room to name a few. Did I mention value.
