I recently purchased a 2013 MKS which is equipped with the navigation and blue tooth.
I have had a problem with the navigation resulting in freezing in the middle of directions and/or not able to get directions.
I was told by Lincoln that there is a glitch with the software of the Iphone and the Lincoln Sync system.
They are aware of the problem and hope to solve it by the end of the summer.

I have had the Lincoln in the past with navigation and never had a problem.
This new system is not working well at all.
