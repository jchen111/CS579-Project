I liked my daughter's 2011 EX model & decided to check-out the 2013 EXL for myself. Although her car was nice/fun to drive, this new model is significantly better in all areas. After two months, I'm more than satisfied ... Good Job Honda!

Bought this car last week.
Previous owner of a 2002 Honda Civic EX.
Initially struggled with the thought of buying another Civic.
Was hesitant until I went to dealership and sat inside, and test drove.
What a difference 11 years makes!
Did get all of the bells and whistles (Nav).
There is no comparison between this car and my 2002 model (not that it was bad - served me well for 11 years).
Drives much quieter and smoother.
Highway gas mileage much nicer (41-42 mpg vs. 33 on my older unit).
In town mileage about 2 mpg better (33 mpg vs 31 mpg).
Decent stereo..great Nav system!

Honda did a great job on this Civic.
They fixed the inadequatcies that Consumer Reports pointed out.
Fit and quality excellent. For those that feel the ride noisy, upgrade to the EX.
The noise is from the cheaper tires on the LX.
This is true with all the Honda line up.
Blue tooth works great, navi and radio excellent.
Good ride quality, 36-38 MPG HW at 65-75 mph.
Overall 29-31 mpg, even with my wife driving...she only know to accelerate or brake..nothing inbetween.
4 wheel disc brakes stop the car very quickly compare to disc/drum combo. I've heard some complaints about the seats, I find them very comfortable.
The Hyundi elantra has 2 big blind spots, Honda does not.

I was looking for the most luxurious car with NAV that I could find for $25k or less.
None of the other manufactures came close in features and quality.


 The interior quality is amazing at any cost level.
The heated seats work great and the ride is very comfortable.
The Bluetooth streaming works well.

The steering is perfect.
The acceleration is a little weak, but the MPG is great.

To top off all the creature comforts, I am averaging 39.4 MPG (a lot of that is highway).
I couldn't be happier.

If you're looking for a sporty and fast car, look else ware.
If your looking for a comfortable ride with lots of quality features at a low cost and great gas milage, this is the car!
