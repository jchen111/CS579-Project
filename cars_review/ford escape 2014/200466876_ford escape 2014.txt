I traded my 2009 chevy Colorado for the 4wd, 1.6 liter Titanium. Although I loved my truck and was sad to trade, I have not missed my truck at all! I now get 27 mpg on highways and have even gotten 33.5 mpg on 2 lane country roads, depending on how hard I drive it. It is a super fun vehicle to drive. We have driven it 8 hours to the beach and it was very comfortable. Everything has worked perfectly on this vehicle. I was worried about the acceleration due to going from a V8 to a 4 cyl, but the acceleration is great. I have no complaints whatsoever about this vehicle. Very happy!

I have been disappointed with my Escape since I bought it.
I currently have 3000 miles on it and have had it for 5 months.
I did extensive research and test drives before picking this car over the Rav 4, CRV and Rogue.
One of the main reasons I wanted this car was for the 2.0 L Turbo engine.
I have had numerous quality issues.
The sync system is over complicated and doesn't work properly with my phone. There is wind noise in the door, the locks freeze on the driver side and I can't get in except through the passenger door. The remote stater works only intermittently. The gas mileage is horrible-17 to 19 mpg. It is winter and the engine is barely broken in so it should get better.

I have a 2014 FWD titanium.i like it a lot. Best car I have had. The tech works well. The performance and ride are very good. Lots of fun! I wish that it got better milage but for 240 HP it is pretty good.
