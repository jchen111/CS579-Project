We have been pleased with this car.
My friend has an older one, and I am happy to have gotten the redesigned version shortly after it was introduced.
The transmission has been re-tuned to shift at higher RPM's, producing brisk and smoother acceleration.
 I was only disappointed that the navigation system's font size is too small and cannot be adjusted.
This could be a safety hazard, since the small font makes it hard to read.

Back in 2008 the Buick Enclave was a work of art, a revolution in cross-over SUV vehicles.
Unfortunately, I do not feel the same about the 2013 Enclave.
 Buick did add some features, but they also removed or downgraded some important things.
 The big selling point of this vehicle was supposed to be the Intellilink system with enhanced
navigation, but then they made the touchscreen smaller than before? Other things like Pandora, Stitcher, Photoviewer simply do not work.
 Are they really selling a $50,000 vehicle that isn't even compatible with an iPhone?
Are you kidding me?
There is also an occastional low rumbling noise in the engine manifold when the vehicle is idling at a stoplight.
