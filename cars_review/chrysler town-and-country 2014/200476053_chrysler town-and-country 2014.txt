My family recently rented this for an 800 mile trip. Let me tell you, it is way over priced! Every piece of interior trim is flimsy plastic. At highway speeds everything vibrates. This vehicle has 10k miles and honestly feels like it has 100k. The seats are rock hard and I just could never justify spending 30k on this vehicle. It does have great tech inside, along with a more than adequate engine for a mini van. Just disappointed that every piece on the inside is fake and flimsy. Fake wood trim, fake leather seats, just not good.

This is the highest example of a modern vehicle
despite the mediocre reports from "experts" - which have done nothing but cast doubts on their objectivity. 

This is the third T&C we have bought and may well be the best of the lot.
Anybody expecting a hotrod will not only be expectedly disappointed, they will be showing their immaturity and ineptitude as well.


Let a lady who is accustomed to minivans behind the wheel - and then the keyboard - and get a true feeling of the quality and confidence that this fine vehicle embodies.

I would say anybody less than satisfied simply purchased the wrong vehicle!

The ride was very poor right off dealers lot. The air shocks did not hold charge. Warranty was called to replace and after many calls from the customer care department with loss orders and 800 back orders on this parts for our area. The parts arrived seven weeks later after repeated calls and miss directions. Unable to drive vehicle. The new parts did not overly improve the ride which is choppy my old 2010 Grand Caravan has a better ride then the more expensive 2014 Town & Country. Last year for this model guess they do not care once they have your money.
