This is my first Subaru, and I love it. I was looking for a comfortable and basic SUV that can handle weather, terrain, and carrying bikes, camping gear, whatever.
After 8 months of ownership I'm completely satisfied with the Forester. It's great fun to drive (the base model with manual transmission, I drove the automatic at the dealership and didn't like it), it's hard not to feel happy when you're in it. Handling is solid and it doesn't feel top heavy at all (helps that the Subaru engines are mounted very low to the ground).
In terms of interior comfort I love how spacious the interior is. The controls are a bit plasticky but I like them that way. The seats are quite comfortable.

I like a lot of things about this car but a huge problem is the very poor quality of the interior . I have had it 4 weeks and had to buy after market seat covers because the seats are so poorly sewn I thought they would not hold up to normal usage .
My dog stood on the front seat console and his claws put a hole in it . The same dog rode in my Jeep for years , stood on the same thing and it never left a mark let alone made a hole . My keys scratched the plastic , the dog put his feet on the dash and it left a scratch . It's almost impossible to use the car and not damage the interior . My Chevy Truck and Jeep Cherokee have the same usage and no damage . I truly hope it is mechanically sound
