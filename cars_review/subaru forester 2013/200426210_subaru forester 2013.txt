Do yourself a favor by opting for a higher trim...if you have a BACK problem.
I purchse 2013 base model just because of the color. It is brown/burgundy (new for 2013) and either wait 8 weeks or take the base model.
After 13,000 miles later, I regret my purchase only because of the lacking(or Non) lumbar support and a thigh support.
I have a back issue since purchasing this CUV. Of course, if you are moderate sized person, this would not be an issue. Otherwise, it is a very solid vehicle.
This is my 4th Subi and would not be the last.

I love my 2013 Subaru Forester, so here comes the nit pickin'.
I bought this SUV in November of 2012. I hate the gray plastic dyed interior trim inside, looks great until you scratch it. Too expensive to fix or replace! Don't like the silver plastic front grill, there is no touch up paint for it! The inside carpet is fraying around the floor mat, but it's not too bad so far, could use better quality carpet. The ride is not bad, but could be smoother. The Bluetooth doesn't filter out noise very well, when trying to call out! No exterior temp gauge!
This vehicle could maybe be 3 inches higher. Keep in mind, these things I mentioned may be improved on the 2014 model!

This is our first Subaru.
We sold our 2000 Honda CRV, which we loved, and thought the Forester provided the best value among the competition.
Initially our best gas mileage was about 22 during a half hour commute, but after our first oil change it rose to 24.5 on the commuting run which is more acceptable.
There are no blind spots with this vehicle and it drives great.
The AWD is as good, if not better, than my Silverado truck.
It scales my steep driveway covered with 4" of snow and ice with ease, something the CRV had trouble doing.
It is a nice looking car that we hope will serve us as well as the CRV.
The base vehicle with alloy wheel package is a great value compared to the others
