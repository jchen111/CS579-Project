I've owned (leased) the ML for a few months now. I turned in a GL which is a full size SUV.

What I like:
The ML has a great ride and very easy steering. For those who like a tight steering wheel, buy a BMW.
This ML is very easy to drive.
I also upgraded to the Harmon Kardon stereo and it is worth the money - crisp and clear with a nice mid range. The ride of the ML is very comfortable. Again, if you like a sporty ride, look else where. I appreciate the comfortable ride, comfortable seats and quietness in the cabin.
In addition, the quality of the materials in the cabin are what you would expect from Mercedes Benz.

What's not to like:
The exterior styling and price.

I bought ML350 with Navigation system.
My wife drives it. I spent some time to get familiar with its navigation system.
It looks like the Navigation system is poorly designed,
no touch screen and typing in address takes a long time, sucks ! (compared with 2005 Toyota Camry V6 XLE's navigation,
Google's navigation, and my portable one,
2013 ML350 is the worst).
Sure, it gots voice command control,
but it is not as easy as inputing addresses, which is what I expected about vioce control.

i ouwned several sub cars over the years but so far,my new Ml350 4matic Mercedez Benz 2013 is the best of all.It drive very smooth,very quite and steady even at high speed driving.Smothness of gearshif operation.I like the modern tecknology that came with it no need to use key to start,the Harman Kardun surround sound is amazing,the HD radio sounds terrific,and all the electronic controls are just great.The navigation syatem and back-up camera,blind spot assist are great witch save me from minor accident.
