I purchased this ML 350 new in August 2012...could hardly wait to get it on the road.....took 3000 mile trip in October and vehicle performed flawlessly......no problems.....then took another 3000 mile road trip in March 2013.....wife and I were almost involved in major accident due to the "map-functioning" of the pre-safe system.....we were in high speed traffic surrounded by about 20 cars....all going in excess of 70 mph.....we were in the middle lane and a car in the lane closest to the side of the road swerved generating the need for an emergency avoidance maneuver on my part.....I stepped on the brakes , which disengaged the cruise control and also swerved to miss the other vehicle this

My wife and I traded a 2008 E350 for a 2011 RX450h when our first child came along for the ease of getting a carseat and a stroller in and out. I had assumed that the Lexus was going to have the same solid feel as a Mercedes-Benz due to it's very high regard within the auto industry. 

While the Lexus is a fine auto, there is no substitute (in this price range) for the solid build quality and the road holding ability of a Mercedes. 

Before I got out of the dealer's lot, I could feel the difference with the ML. This vehicle just feels so much more substantial than the Lexus in every way. When paying $50k+, I want to feel the vehicle is built like a tank, with the ML that's what you get
