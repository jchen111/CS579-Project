I walked in to the dealer and bought this right off the lot.
I have owned Toyotas in the past and knew this would be reliable like the others.
I have the convenience package with auto, A/C, Bluetooth audio system.
It would have been nice if this package came with heated seats but the side mirrors are heated.
So far, after 4 months, it's been great.
I drive 45 minutes into work each day and this car is a pleasure to drive on the highway and great to park.
There are a few blind spots near the front window pillars where I feel the side mirrors get in the way.
The radio is a plus as it connects to Ipod, blackberry etc and handsfree function is great!
