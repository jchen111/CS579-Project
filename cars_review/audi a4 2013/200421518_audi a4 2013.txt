I love this car -- it looks great inside and out, the build quality is extraordinarily high, and it offers just the right balance of tight handling, comfort, and size.
Personally, I find the engine to be more than up to the task for fun driving (especially when combined with the sport suspension, which I also have), although if you're after raw horsepower you should probably look for something other than the A4 at this price.

My 2013 Audi A4 2.0T burns about 1 quart of oil every 2000 miles.
I had read about this issue with older A4, but the dealer had sworn that the problem had been resolved.
Apparently not!
