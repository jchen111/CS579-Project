Drove 75 miles to get car we wanted.
Replaced wife's 2006 Saab 9-3 Sportcombi; would have bought another Saab 9-3 if company hadn't gone belly up.
Premium Plus is a well damped firm/rough ride over potmarked New England backroads; highway ride is excellent.
Not a big fan of the electronic steering at highway speeds; poor feedback through steering wheel.
Wife drives the car and gets 23-24 mpg; I drive and get 28-29 mpg. On the all highway drive home from dealership, trip computer showed 31.7 mpg with cruise at 75 mph; mpg ranges above are using miles driven/gallons to fill tank calculation.
If we could afford a Q5 TDI, would get that for the wife, and take the A4 for myself.

This will be my 5th A4 in either a sedan or wagon version.
While the car looks great inside and out and the improved HP over the years has added to the thrill of driving the new electronic steering has certainly been a negative.
If you are looking for a soft feel to lumber off to the grocery store the steering is fine but push it a bit or take a long highway trek and you will notice the floaty feel.
Overall the car is fine but if your a searching for a tight steering / handling feel you may want to give the car a good test drive before you purchase.
After this lease is up I will definetly look at a tighter car like the BMW.

Wanted to update my review first made shortly after purchase.
Have owned the vehicle for 8 months now and continue to be impressed by it.
No problems after 8000 miles.
Car was virtually unstopable in heavy snow (with 4 Pirelli snows mounted) this past winter.
I average 26-28 mpg in mixed drving; best tank 34 mpg highway at 70 mph.
Despite what some others have noticed, the engine has not consumed any oil in its first 8000 miles.
Break the engine in as directed in the manual and there should not be any problem.

After buying a 2013 VW Passat TDI in October for myself, it was my wife's turn for a new car. She had her heart set on a BMW 328i...until she got in one. Too small, too confining, truly baffling ergonomics. We then looked at another Passat TDI(too big), a Jetta TDI(too sparse), a Volvo S80(too something), and finally the Audi A4. We were both sold on it right away due to the Quattro and Nav systems. We immediately put 3,000 miles on it in the first week with a trip to Washington State. Handled perfectly on wet, icy and snowy roads, and was a really comfortable ride. No sign at all of the oil burning issue others have had after 3k miles, so hopefully that's a good sign.

This is my second Audi. I upgraded from a 2012 Audi A4 2.0T FWD with CVT. It was a great car. Great performance and gas mileage.
However, I had an opportunity to upgrade to a quattro with the light package and 2013 upgrades. So far, the car is awesome. Drives even better with the Quattro and suspension and steering upgrades. And those lights, beautiful. The car is even more stricking then my 2012. I also like the 8 speed auto better then the CVT.

Traded an '11 Acura TSX for this 2013 A4 Premium Plus and so glad I did!!
Could not get comfortable in the Acura, and too little rear seat room for the family.
This Audi is "right sized" for a family of 4.
Plenty of useable trunk space.
Ride is composed but comfortable, 18 inch wheels help the car stick around corners, powerful brakes to haul the car down from speed which it gains easily from the 2.0 turbo running through 8 gears.
Excellent fit and finish and an attractive sedan from any angle in my opinion.
Electric power steering gives up some feel, but is far superior to that found in the Acura. I
compared with BMW 3, Mercedes C class, Infiniti, and new Lexus ES.
A4 was superior!

I just upgraded from my 2010 A4 to the 2013. The 8-speed automatic provides smoother acceleration and better mileage (averaging over 25mpg in mixed driving). They fixed some of the annoying bugs in the "Infotainment" system. However I was disappointed to see the folding rear seats move to the premium plus package. The new brown interior is ill-conceived. Should have been a lighter saddle-brown as offered in the BMW. Overall, it's a good value for the class, and works better for me than the 3-series.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2013 Audi A4 is no longer a good buy. I am on my third and the changes to the steering have made this car a poor buy. The steering has become loose and numb and when driving past 60 you feel has if you have no control of the car. The 2.0 turbo also bangs constantly at low speeds and if your try to accelerate fast all you get is a pedal of air. Driving this car used to be fun but has become typical of an American car with too much over steer and lack of initial power. The mileage is nowhere 25 but rather a 20 overall and the company suggests premium gas. Buy a volkswagen jetta instead .
