Have owned for 3 weeks now, and the smiles keep coming.
This car is very well put together, looks great, handles well, and has plenty of power on tap when you need it.
It is very comfortable as a daily commuter, even with the stiffer R-Design suspension.
As other reviews across the web have stated, the steering is a bit numb and the manual shift action a bit rubbery compared to other sport coupes/"hot hatches", but it makes up for it with how well the overall package fits together.
This is a car that somehow seems greater than the sum of it's parts.
Hard to explain.
