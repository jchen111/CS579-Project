This is really a lovely car.  We purchased the last '13 new in July'14.  Auto trans, T-5.  Did TONS of research beforehand.  We are a Toyota/Honda family, so European is a departure, with trepidation.  We have the Premier Plus package, not R-Design.   Thus far, the car is beyond expectations; a joy to drive, beautiful to look at, and well made.  It's QUIET inside, very powerful, and so different. You won't see them often, which is nice too.  It's not a high performance hatch, and that's good, because we didn't want that.  For those w/o kids, and a different hauling vehicle, this is a great commuter that spoils with luxury, is safe, and gives you confidence.  No problems so far.
