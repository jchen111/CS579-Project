I traded in my 2011 BMW 535i for this vehicle. My 535i lacked x-drive and was a manual transmission so I was looking for something with awd, automatic, great resale value, and reliability and this Acura fit the bill. Having driven the BMW a couple years I was pleasantly surprised by how this Acura handles and the acceleration. The only gripe I would have is that it rides a little stiff with the 19's. But it isn't an uncomfortable ride. The build quality is very good and the gas mileage so far isn't bad...21 mpg's combined city and highway.

I have had this car for a couple months after trading in a S5 for a more family orented sedan.
I looked into the A6, and Lexus's but felt they were to pricey, when a collegue told me to look into the TL.
I was shocked when I looked into the price on the fully loaded TL AWD compared to the the comparible lexus(Power wise) and A6 (size and power), A4 was to weak of an engine.
The sticker might have been 46k but I was offered the car for 40,650 + 1,500 cash for trading in the car.
The car was great inside and outside styling was much improved over the 2009-2011.
The car drives smooth, tech features are great, and AWD works extreamly well in the NE winter.

I've only had the car for about a month (900 miles), so commenting on reliability, etc. is impossible.
Given Honda's track record though, I'm sure it's excellent, especially when compared to cars in its class.
I know from what I've been told and read, BMW's, Mercs, and Audi's are somewhat unreliable and extremely expensive to repair.
Furthermore, resale value on all of them is awful.
I'm not rich, so not throwing my money away was a big factor in my decision.
Lexus and Infiniti make a good car too, you just have to buy what's right for you.

Purchased a New Acura AWD Sport package 2012 TL. The purchasing process 
was exceptional. A Two hour drive home
 was a disaster. The new TL front end shimmied and pulled to the left. I took it to local Acura dealer because unsafe to drives. They balanced the tires, charged me $50. Brand new vehicle. Returned to original dealer to fix left drifting on interstate highways. They checked said all was in spec. Drove two hours back and it still drifted left. Took videos,
took it back. They recommended different tires for over $900. Same problem. Requested to escalate with Acura. No response. Finally I elected to trade in 2012 AWD TL before I was seriously injured.
