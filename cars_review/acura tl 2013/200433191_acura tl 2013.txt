Acura has set new standards for using poor quality materials.
My dashboard developed several
large cracks after just a few days parked in my parking lot at work this summer in North Carolina.
(Other than work, the car is always garaged.)

The dealership claims it cracked due to maintenance(!)
I own 4 other cars ranging from 1974 to 2006 & have never had a cracked dashboard.


The TL has more rattles than your average new-born child.
The cover over my cup-holder broke after just a few weeks.


I truly wish I had bought a Lexus, BMW or Mercedes.
