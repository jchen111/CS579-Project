After 10 years of Infiniti G35 sedans (2003 and 2006 models, 6MT), I switched to Acura SH-AWD with the Technology Package (the only configuration I could get manual transmission!) in late March, 2013.
The TL gives up a little of the visceral,sporty feel of the G, but gains in overall refinement and all weather capability.
The TL is is a substantially larger car (6" longer, and 4" wider than the G), and hence feels less tossable than the G.
However, it has very fine handling and a composed ride.
I love my car, it has been absolutely trouble free, and feels extraordinarily competent.
It is a compellingly good value in the upscale segment.

All wheel drive, manual 6 speed, 305hp, comfort, not a comuter car as far as gas mileage, love it smooth and quiet, great stereo, would be better with 75 more hp.

Regardless if you like the exterior appearance or not, you can't deny that this is a luxury bargain.
Match the features this car has to the equivalent BMW or Audi and you're looking at 10 grand higher.
And that may not be including AWD.

Performance, comfort, features, quality, transmission, and overall satisfaction couldn't be better.
Not that it's a bad thing, but if you're looking for an AWD sedan with a manual transmission, this is your only option.

Note: I've only owned my TL for a short time.
If I experience anything like the other reviewer on here did then I will update my review.
As for now, I couldn't be happier.
