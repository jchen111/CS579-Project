I have wanted a Jeep Wrangler since I was 5(I am 34 now).
When I bought my Honda CRV in 2010, I wanted the Jeep and everyone told me it was impractical, and I listened....but I am glad I waited until 2013, because I love the changes and I had a decent trade in with the CRV.
I have a Rock Lobster color Sport with 6 speed manual and soft top.
Even though I am in this Jeep for over 2 hours every day, I still find any excuse to go out and drive in it.
I know, now, that I will never drive anything but a Wrangler!!
And, if anyone is looking in the Northern VA area...go to Lustine Jeep in Woodbridge!!!
My salesman, James, was a Jeep owner and entusiast....and he Was amazing!!!

Just got my 2013 Wrangler 4 days ago. Had a 2012 and it seems like a huge difference. Drove it to Wright Patterson and back this morning. All expressway and got 27.7 mpg. That's 65 almost all the way. Driving 55 is better yet. Love the new seats. Much more cushioning. Got the Alpine stereo and it's awesome.

 Plenty of room for me and the dog. Took the back seat out, so my next date has to ride in the back since the dog has the front.

Wanted a Wrangler for a long time but didn't like the comfort in the 2012 and earlier. Also concerned about the gas mileage, being used to driving fairly economical cars. The 2013 comfort well surpassed the previous years'. The new seats are much better, though they could be a little firmer. The driving position is great for me (5'11''). I love having that higher vantage point on the road. Gas mileage is not bad. I've seen 23-24 on highway, keeping it at the speed limit. I usually drive it conservatively so my mileage is better than average I guess. I have a loaded Sport with dual top. I put the soft top on a week ago just to see what it was like, but decided to stick with the hard top.

I felt I should write a review for all those considering a Wrangler. I purchased a Sport w/Auto, a fairly extensive list of options and soft top . But the best things about the 2013 version is the MUCH improved engine, the greatly improved comfort of the seats and the premium upgrade top, which is more of a fabric versus the plastic. It makes for a very quiet ride (as much as a Jeep can be.) I drive approximately 30 miles a day and it is a pleasure to drive. It will never be confused with a sedan, but it doesn't beat you up like the old Jeeps. Gas mileage is as advertised, approx 18mpg. The fun factor is great, easy to take down entire top or just flip the top over the driver area. Get one!

We were looking to replace the Mini(3rd car)
As the pleasure of driving it in the warm east coast months with the top down, shifting its precise 6 speed, getting looks because charcoal and black racing stripes (totally hot car package)...was not doing it for us anymore.
We wanted a reliable in
-case of emrgency (snow) car.
Also, something we can put the top down.
The sun roof is easy and manual.
Looking for just 2 weeks.
We drove a 2012 and it was OK.
It seemed to be missing a lot of things we've become accustomed to.
Than we drove the 2013 and what a difference from the plush seats to the electric windows to the NEW great color-Commander Green.

This is my first Jeep, 2013 Wrangler Sport with 6 speed.
I have had many new cars over the years, but this one is the most fun car I have ever owned.
It is a blast to drive, get 22+ mpg on the highway, fits in any parking place, have about 2000 miles on it now and am really pleased with the vehicle.
Good fit and finish, hardtop makes it quiet inside.
Have a convertible in the summer, something to go in the snow in the winter, and can go back country also.
Nice work Jeep!
