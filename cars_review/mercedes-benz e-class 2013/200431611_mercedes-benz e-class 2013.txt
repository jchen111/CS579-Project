Prior to this car I owned 4 C-Classes (2006, 2008, 2009, 2011). Personally, I felt the C-Class was a good vehicle that came with a premium price tag because of the 3-point badges affixed to the hood and bumper. Unable to get my hands on a C-Class coupe w/ 4Matic I went with the 2013 E350 Sport 4-Matic (Black on Black, AMG Wheels, P2, and Pano-roof).
What a suprise. There is a clear line drawn in the sand between the C-Class and the E/S Classes. First, the E-Class is crafted with overall superior materials and attention to detail. Second, this car is fast, much faster than my last C300. At almost 4000lbs this car is a beast (0-60 approx 5.6). Last, its roomey inside like a Lincoln Town Car.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moved up to the E-class from 2011 C300 4Matic Sport because I wanted a slightly larger vehicle.
The E350 certainly accomplished that.
Compared to the C300 sport the E350 ride is more comfortable but a little less "sporty".
There is a some body roll noted when driving even mildly aggressive but not so enough to ruin the driving experience.
There is plenty of power from the 302hp V6 and surprisingly reasonable gas mileage, thus far.
Just like with my previous MB, I wanted a vehicle that stood out a little from the other MBs commonly seen.
I opted for the sport trim (obviously), the 18" AMG twin spoke wheel package and rear deck-lid spoiler.
Aside from appearance choices, I went with P2 p
