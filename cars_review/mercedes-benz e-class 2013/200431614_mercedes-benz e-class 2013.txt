I have owned 3 MB diesel sedans and they were great fast efficient low maintenance bullet proof especially the 1998 E300 a rocket and 29 mpg ave :)

MB with the help of the EPA has put the diesel line up in MB a liability to dive not a durable 500K mile car... For one you have to purchase 35.00 a BluTech fluid every oil change... at 7 gallons a pop... Perhaps you could put any DEF from a chain store at 12 a gallon... Why the need for an expensive exhaust system how much will it cost to replace? On the EClass a Diesel comes with RFT because of the blue tank. So a guy who drives say 50 to 200 miles a day must rely on RFT and have no spare... to make room for a Urea tank... S350 has a spare
