Recently retired and wanting something less expensive to operate, my Audi A8 was no longer under warranty and would be expensive to repair. After1 month I can say that this is a nice driving car but the COMAND system and voice recognition is vastly inferior to the Audi MMI. Such systems have become integral to todays driving experience
defining to a large extent how the driver interacts with the car. MB COMAND requires much more input to navigate the menus than Audi. The voice recognition seems less intelligent and reliable compared to my past Audi experience. COMAND may have a shorter learning curve but will require more effort to operate than MMI. Miss parking assist.
