Once I hit 65,000 miles...

- Engine oil leak
- AC motor bad
- Motor Mounts collapsed
- 275.00 key

If this is luxury driving, I want out.
I will go back to Lexus, Acura, or Infinity.
This is a joke.
Now I know why they have free cappuccino at the dealer...because you will be there a lot!
Never will buy a Mercedes again!
Horrible car for the money.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Until recently I had a MBZ C230 and E350. After 5+ years of owning my C230 I started having problems with it. I am not the kind of person who complains after owning a car for more than 5 years. This latest incident, though, with a newly leased 2013 E350 with bells and whistles has actually ended my relationship with Mercedes for good.
I have already traded in my C230 for another car from another luxury car maker, I intend to trade in my E350 in due time. The 3 year lease on the E350 has more than 2 years left on it (so the incident described below happened with a car that is only ~10 months old).See below.See "suggested improvements" for incident
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great car, comfortable and great value. BUT be careful, as Mercedes does not stands behind their products. 

I have a MBZ E350, and at 63K, I got a check engine problem that required a balance shaft to be changed at the cost of $6K, because of a shaft that was not properly tempered. 

MBZ clearly built a product that was flawed, as about 20% of the cars that has the E350 engine had the problem. BUT they leaved us poor users to deal with it, and didn't stand behind their poor craftmaship product.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally
got
back
to MBZ E350
2013. What
a car
from the
past
ones
I have
 had. This
car
is
as smooth
as butter
when driving
and not
only
that
but
the 4000.00
premium luxury package
we got
with it
is the
best. All around
I am
in heaven
with this
beauty. Comfort, security, the
SOUND,
you feel like
 your
are
in the
concert
when
 you listen
to the
CD's
or
DVD's . The
best
of
the
best
for
me
and
the
family, Great
job MBZ. You will not
be
disappointed
when buying
or
leasing
this baby
.
