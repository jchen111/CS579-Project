I leased a 2013 E350 sport sedan about 7 months ago.
When I picked up the car the door had a scratch in it.
Great, band new car, already repainted.
TThen the car developed a pronounced rattle at idle.
The dealer fixed it by adding felt tape along side the "fuel line". (!?)
6 months later I test drove a C300 and noticed it had
less exhaust system noise/drone.
I took the E350 in and they compared it to other E350 sedans and agreed my exhaust system was make an unusually loud droning noise.
They contacted MB and were told that there were other complaints on this issue and that a "case" had been opened but there was no resolution yet.
I was told to check back in 6 months!?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This 2013 is my fifth E class.
I also have owned S class, CLK, C class, SLK.
 I traded a 2013 Equss with 10k miles for this new 2013 E because I missed the feeling of being connected to the road.
.
I have 6k miles on the E car.
 My big disappointment in the new E with Harman Kardon Pro Logic 7 is the radio.
There is not enough low end.. bass.
 I noticed others complaining about lack of bass in E cars.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have read a lot of the reviews on the E35O and know a lot of people like this car but I think it is overrated because it has the Mercedes name plate. If the same car had a Ford or Chevy name plate on it I wonder if it with be rated so highly.

I have a 2013 E-350 with Sports package.
I have had some issues with the command console and the road noise is terrible.
Mercedes say the level of road noise is normal. I guess since I have the sport package.
It is too much noise for any car to have coming in the cabin. I have a 2001 BMW 530 with sports package and it is quieter than the E350.

The technical issues with the command console, I plan to visit the dealer today.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I test car whole bunch of new cars for extended periods including Audi A6, Audi Q5, BMW 5 Series and even Jeep Cherokee.
But I decided to buy Mercedes E350 Sport.
Audi A6 was strong contender but went with E350.
Car feels assured, is quieter inside the cabin than Audi or BMW.
Not to mention that I got a gteat deal on it nearly 10K less than MSRP.
The value for money, none other could beat.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice car but I recommend road testing on the freeway before buying.
Mine makes a whine between 70 - 80 MPH.

Dealer replaced rear end twice in 2500 miles.
Still whines.

They opened a "factory Case File" on my car.
MB representative promptly called me and told me the sound was a "Characteristic" and they would do no more fixes, even though no other E350 does what mine does.
 I am stuck with a car that makes a whine on the freeway, and I have to drive a lot on the freeway due to where I live.

Hard to believe that for this price point MB won't stand behind their cars.
They used the "characteristic" line to avoid the car being labeled a lemon.
Very Dishonest. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just picked up my 2013 E350 Sedan - MSRP was $64,865.
This is my 7th straight year purchasing a new E350.
This one, by far, is the best one Mercedes has ever built.
The ride and handling are superb!
The technology is functional, but not overwhelming.
Audio system (Harman/Kardon 610 watt 5.1 surround sound w/14 speakers) is the best I've ever heard in a luxury sedan.
Outstanding acceleration when needed!
Great visibility both front and rear.
Blind Side Monitor is a must option.
Wood/leather steering wheel in Walmut is like a piece of good furniture.
3D NAV system is phenomenal!
Voice control system responds to every command.
Mbrace system great addition!
Best E350 yet!
