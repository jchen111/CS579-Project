Just purchased a new 2014 Mercedes CLS 550 (MSRP $82,210).
I usually purchase E350 Sedans, but because of the superior, outstanding deal I got on this vehicle, I could not resist. First noticeable difference is the outstanding power and performance - 402 hp in a 4.7 liter V8.
Fit and Finish are outstanding.
Interior design and comfort in front seats is astounding.
The ride is smoother and more refined than anything I have ever driven.
The car is "dead-out" gorgeous.
Safety features like lane-tracking, blind spot monitors and PARKTRONIC are comforting and impeccably designed.
Harman/Kardon audio system is unsurpassed in clarity and sound separation.
Best car I have ever owned.
