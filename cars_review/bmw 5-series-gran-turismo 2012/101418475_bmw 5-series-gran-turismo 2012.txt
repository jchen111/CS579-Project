Traded in my 2012 Audi A6 as the seats were extremely uncomfortable (same seats on the A7) with rounded top of seats cutting into shoulder blades in order to get a hatchback BMW with the extremely comfortable optional Multi-contour seats.
Well worth the many dollars lost in trade.
 Love the space and the very smooth ride.
 Interior on 5GT is even nicer than on the Audi - impressive.
 Can toss my bike in the back with ease.
Dual tailgate is practical.
 Much slower off the start than the 300hp 700 lbs lighter Audi - should have gotten the V-8.
Ideally BMW would sell this as a 540 and 550 like the 6 and 7 series allowing a slighter more powerful base engine.
