2014 Q60 Journey - I generally agree with the Edmunds review, however, there are two things that I wish that I'd known before getting into a lease on this car, which would have swayed me in another direction: MPG & the entertainment system.

I've had the car a few days shy of five months and in that time I'm astounded at the poor gas mileage.
The EPA sticker estimate puts it at a 22-combined MPG; however, my best efforts at driving gas-wise have resulted in no better than 12.9 MPG combined (!). 

12.9 MPG is low by any standars-- and believe me you'll start to feel the hit in your wallet when filling that tank with premium.
