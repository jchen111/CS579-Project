Took the car on the road for a weekend trip.
It handled flawlessly.
Quiet, nimble, quick and smooth.
I discovered that the car also has a lane keeping system that tightens the steering wheel should you drift out of your lane.
The car has just over a thousand miles and the gas mileage is quite impressive.
I have the 4 cylinder AWD.
Can't wait to try it in the snow.
