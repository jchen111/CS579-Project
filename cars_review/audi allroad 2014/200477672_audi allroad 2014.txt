To begin with, I am a SUV refugee. I have lived in the Colorado mountains near Denver and got stuck driving SUV's to have snow clearance so that my vehicle wouldn't be turned into a snowplow at the wrong times. But I did need the space to haul road bicycles inside the vehicle in the summer during rainy weather along with baggage. Also needed power for climbing the mountains and good gas mileage for driving long distances without living in a gas station. This Allroad does it all with ease and style. This reminds me of my first Allroad of years past but this is truly a starship in comparison. Love this car and the handling is great compared to a SUV which is its true competition.
