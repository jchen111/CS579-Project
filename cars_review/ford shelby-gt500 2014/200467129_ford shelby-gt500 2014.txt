Not much driving time in the new Shelby yet, but love every thing about it so far.
It is quick.
It sticks to the road.
Styling is awesome.
I am not sure how they got everything to fit under the hood, but it does fit nicely.
My Shelby is a Metallic Red Convertible.
I consider it the most beautiful car I have every seen.
Not because it is mine.
Looking forward to putting it on a road trip this summer.

The 2014 reviews I have read always compare the Shelby GT500 to cars of different catagories. The comparisons to me are skewed and biased. The Shelby GT500 is just what the late Carroll Shelby wanted-The fastest and most powerful pony car on the planet. It should not be compared to all the high end sports cars that are double or triple the price. Paid reviews or biased opinions can't diminish the fact the Shelby GT500 has the most hp of any American production model vehicle ever and it is a blast to drive.
