Upgraded from an Infiniti G37x. A bit more money, about the same performance but everything else blows my infiniti away.
I got mine in black with the AMG package and it looks stunning. Get quite a few compliments. Being a techie, I love toys, and this car is chock full of them.
The build quality is amazing. Everything has a vault-like solidity to it.
Drives and handles great, I pretty much put it in "S" mode as soon as I start it off. Wish there was a way to leave that on permanently.
