Traded my 2012 C300 sedan for the 2014 coupe.
Very happy with that decision.
This car is a lot more fun to drive, better on gas, and downright beautiful. The seats are very comfortable for long trips.
For a coupe the ride is pretty decent.
Only slightly bumpier than the C Sedan.
In Sport mode it handles amazing! 
I got all the same options the sedan had with the exception of the Media Package (w/navigation).
that was a BAD decision.
The Becker Map Pilot is a piece of crap.
My advice...spend the money on the Media Package.
Looking forward to owning this car for a long time.
