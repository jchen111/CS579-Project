I would have never rated an MB until the C300 we just bought.
 After having it for one week and less than 500 miles on it, it developed a big problem.
 My wife was driving it to her office and all of the systems started shutting down.
Steering, temperature controls, radio, etc.

Turns out the main belt, the "Serpentine" belt which controls everything was broken.
I don't understand why this could ever happen on a brand new C300 (nor does the dealer).
Anyone else ever heard of this?
Was mine built during Oktoberfest or is it just a one time thing?
Dealer speculates that it wasn't installed properly at the factory.
Scares me for what else could go wrong!
