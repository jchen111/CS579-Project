I absolutely love my Corolla! I loved the warranty options offered by ToyotaCare, and I generally couldn't be happier with my dealership and that entire process.
There are very few negative things I can even say about this car. The gas mileage is great, I average 32.2 around town! When it comes down to it, he's not a luxury sedan, and there aren't umpteen million bells and whistles, but he's fun, sporty, and an all around an awesome car if you're not a nit-picker. More electronic garbage is more to possibly malfunction, I don't need it. (Even saying this, my '92 Celica's electronics all function perfectly, so I really wasn't concerned in Toyota's functionality, other brand owners, beware!)

I just leased a 2013 S mainly for my son.
He loves the car. Sunroof.
Rides well. Quiet. Enough power with the manual. He's 6'4" and fits fine. Edmunds recommends considering other cars but the ones they recommend don't inspire confidence. The difference between the editors and me is that they get to give theirs back after 2 weeks. I noticed the negative user comments on the Corolla are around style and a little under powered. I noticed the negative comments on the suggested alternatives are mechanical, like transmissions grinding and steering columns shaking. I guess I'd rather have a "disconnected driving experience" than a disconnnected wallet experience.

I purchased my 2013 Toyota Corolla S 5spd a week ago. This was my first new car purchase in over ten years. I considered the 2013 Honda Civic LX 4DR, 2013 Hyundai Elantra GLS 4DR, and the 2013 Ford Focus 4DR and 5DR HB. Civic was nice, but beyond our budget. The Elanta was a close second, and the Ford wasn't even interesting enough for us to test-drive. I was actually going to skip the Corolla altogether but decided to look at them anyway. Glad I did. The S trim in a 5spd is anything but dull, drab, and uninspiring. Granted, the acceleration isn't mind-blowing, but this car is cool, comfortable, safe, sensible and will last us for years to come. We got it for a smokin' price too.
