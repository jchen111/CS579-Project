I've been driving a GMC Sierra as of late, and getting 13-15 mpg, so I really needed something for my drive.
I bought the 2013 Corolla S to commute across Phoenix.
It drives really nicely.
Tight, responsive steering, excellent braking, good acceleration (especially considering it's a 1.8!) and a good looking car.
I'm 6'2" and the interior is a little tight for me, but it's not too bad.
I just drove to Idaho and back for a funeral, and I averaged 34 mpg.
Long hours in the car aren't super comfortable, but overall, for the money, it's a great, zippy little car that gets excellent gas mileage and is pretty fun to drive. AND it's a Toyota, so it's gonna last! I would highly recommend one!

I bought the car brand new back in April. So far 8,000 miles and no issues. I am averaging around 30mpg. This is my first Toyota Ive always owned ford focuses, I test drove the 2013 focus and hated the way the transmission felt. I have no problem at all with the 4-spd transmission that the corolla offers and the car has plenty of peep when i need it. I love the electronic steering. I have the premium package so it comes with the 17 inch rims and the sunroof.

Many people pan the Corolla's aging platform saying it has drum brakes etc. Well the Ford Focus has drum brakes and people think it is the best ever. I drove both cars, owned the new Dart and sold it, driven the Chevy Cruise and Noisy Mazda 3. Out of all the cars I did like the new Civic the most, however their price premium at dealer lots is not worth what you get on Civic Vs. Corolla. The new 2014 Corolla doesn't change much from the old and I didn't feel the need to wait for the newer model. The car is quiet, smooth, and build quality compared to the Dart isn't even close. The Focus was small on the inside compared to the Corolla and I would buy another Corolla in the future.

Bought the 2013 Corolla S.
I'll admit, it's not a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.
If you want that, pay the extra $$$.
But, it doesn't claim to be a strong, powerful, luxury sedan.
It's a reliable, affordable, sedan that will last for years and years.
Perfect commuter for long drives, plenty of power for me.....unless you plan on driving 90 mph +, which I don't.
Great gas mileage and this car will continue to pay for itself long after it's time due to how reliable it is.
I was surprised that it even came with a "touch screen" sound system for a basic Toyota sedan.
Enjoy the gas mileage and buy a luxury car if that's what you want.

I actually just bought a Corolla S a hours ago and I already regret my purchase, I should have gone with the CIVIC or the Sentra, better Gas, more power, more leg room and much better Dash Board Look., I did like the sporty look of the S model, but after a few hours I should have just gone with the Civic, 30 more dollars a month would have been definitely worth it.

If this helps in anyway, i had a new 2012 elantra which needless to say sucked. Yea all it has on this car is probably fuel economy and modern interior, but corolla hands down beats the elantra bc of the QUALITY. Toyotas are way more dependable and this car is sturdy and i love it. My old car for a brand new car actually had loose wire issues so i brought it to the dealer 4 times for numerous issues. ( getting stuck in park/ drive). Suspension sucks as well, car slips alot. Can barely go over 60 on the highway over few bumps with out noticing slips . So to me corolla s is AWESOME! No slips..great suspension, very comfortable to me and i dont have to worry which is the best peace of mind :)

I just bought a 2013 Corolla S loaded. I am still in the high from it. I can tell you that thing is nice! It's not a boring ride at all. I have plenty of power for traffic maneuvering. I love how it has a luxury ride feel and how spaciousness the cabin is. I think it looks very cool and hip...especially at night.
Not plain like some others say. This thing is sharp on the outside also...very sporty. I really made a wise decision buying this. Not only is it cool and stylish, but it will last many years to come thanks to Toyota's quality. 

I wish I had a garage to preserve it.

It has been more than a month and I am happy with my Toyota Corolla S car. It has nice interior and built in touch screen display for bluetooth smart phone connection, radio/CD buttons. S trim doesn't have variable wipers.

All your smartphone contacts are visible and that's a great feature on display. The interior is also nice and spacious compared to Sentra in the same class. S trim doesn't have intermittent variable wipers compared to LE. It's 0.7 inch shorter than LE.


Makes lot of noise and vibration when it changes gears to high but then it's pretty smooth. When climbing uphill, it sometimes smells gas.

It has good pick up (torque) but not like previous corollas.

This is my husband and I's first new car. We absolutely love it. I have to agree and disagree with some of what Edmunds says about the car. The interior design is very nice to me. I love the touch screen music player; we listen to a lot of music and so that is important. However then again as a music person, the speakers could use just a bit more pep and refining. Also it's acceleration is a bit lacking, but over all it is a wonderful car and I do feel safe driving it with my infant daughter. We bought this car in a charcoal grey, which is also very lovely.

My wife and I purchased this new 2013 model of the Corolla Type S 2013 this week for her birthday and to get rid of her old Saturn.
We were not considering the Corolla because in the previous years model we did not like driving this car and felt the interior was too plain.
Although there are similarities between the 2012 and 2013 model, some of the improvements were the touch screen digital display in the center of the dash.
It allows me to touch navigate through my music and between my artillery devices like my iPhone.
The bluetooth pairing was simple.
Driving was fun, comfortable, and felt solid.
The steering is loose but easy to navigate.
The ride is very comfortable.
