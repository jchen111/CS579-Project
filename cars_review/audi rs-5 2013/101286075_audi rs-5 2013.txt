Fun to drive, yet with drive select, you can make it as aggressive a ride as you want. 

Custom your modes into 16 combinations

DRL LEDs.

Transmission = VERY smooth gear changing.

Exhaust sound = loud downshifts, great sounding upshifts and acceleration sounds.

Exterior design = subjective.
To me, it was aggressive in a very good way.

Uniqueness = only 1,500 to be sold and made for the North American market for 2013 and 2014 (check NA Audi President Scott Keogh's video interview).

Performance = Based on caranddriver's lightning lap times, it beats the M3, M5, M6, and V8 R8 by a slim margin.


Mileage = just enough efficiency to omit the Green tax.

I replaced my 2010 S5 with a 2013 RS5 in December.
The S5 was great; the RS5 is an order of magnitude beyond that.
It handles beautifully (I never considered raving about steering but the way it steers had to be experienced to be believed: whoever thought turning a corner could be so much fun), the controls are well-placed and intuitive.
The Google GPS is a treat.
Let's face it, no one needs 450 horsepower, but my, my it sure is nice to have it.
Do yourself a favor and spring for the sports exhaust, 'cause if you ever feel depressed all you have to do is sit in your driveway and rev the engine; why take a pill?
If that doesn't work, just get it on the road and shift to sports mode.
