I just ticked over 17000 miles with my 2013 Accord EX-L V6 (with Nav). Other than the initial connectivity problems with the audio head unit they have been trouble-free. The car performs well and is capable of some excellent fuel economy. I have had highway drives of over 42MPG which is extraordinary given the 278hp V6. The 6AT trans is smooth and responsive. It has excellent fit and finish, a smooth and quiet but busy ride, reasonable handling given LRR tires, excellent interior and trunk room. The interior remains tight and rattle free.

I have had a 2008 and 2011 Accord and the 2013 is the roughest ride I have ever experienced.
I took it in for service as I thought this cannot be by design.
The tech said the transmission is designed to downshift when you take your foot off the gas (regardless of whether you want to slow or not).
The constant shifting between gears makes for a very rough ride.
I constantly have the desire to shift to neutral to stop the shifting.
Clearly a step down from the 2011 Accord.
The Navigation system is also a downgrade from the 2011 model.
Be cautious with buying the vehicle especially if you have been happy with previous accords.

This is worse than my 6 year old COSTCO Garmain GPS which I use in my new 2013 Honda Accord.
It shows grey streets BUT without names of streets.
Go figure, a map without street names?

Purchased the car about a week ago and i've received nothing but compliments from people that have seen it.
The car looks and feel's sporty (i especially like the LED headlights and dual exhaust) and i'm getting a combined 29MPG on an even mix of city and highway driving over the first 200 miles with ECON not enabled.
I plan on using the ECON feature on my next tank of gas to compare the difference.
The inside is roomy and comfortable.
The technology features are great, there is just so much you can do with all of the bluetooh enabled options.
The NAV screen is large and has a crisp resoltuion and the rear and side camera's are a nice addition.
Overall, a great experience so far.

I purchased my V6 Accord on 6/1/13 and feel it is remarkable. This car should cost $15M-$20M more. Extremely roomy, real large trunk, terrific build quality and steering feel is perfect. I am still on my first tank of gas and averaging 29.7 MPG (according to the trip computer) in mixed driving with the econ mode. What more can you ask of a powerful V6?
The navigation system/infotainment system takes some time to learn but most younger people should have no problem. My only complaints: 1).The stereo system is inferior to the 2012 Accord. Has very little base which is just the opposite of the 2012 EXL. 2). The carpeting is really cheap. Has no pile and looks like mouse fur. Shame on Honda!

My 2013 Accord EX-L V6 w/navigation 2/13 purchase started off going the wrong way leaving my dealer's lot:

1. the car simply pulls to the left only at highway speeds.
Two dealer visits within that week were a waste of time.
They won't/can't figure out why this is so (any I'm not only driving on crowned roads).
Had I noted this during my two test drives prior to purchase, I would have passed on this car.
Annoying!
You've been warned.

2. The audio system certainly is sexy and inviting, but when little things don't work like the subwoofer to the email/text message reading feature (using an iPhone 5)...or the lack of any Gracenote update installed in the car (until July 2013): grrrrrr

I'm curious as to why people like it, since it is the worst, most unreliable, problem filled car Honda has ever made.

I have 20 unreolved problems with my car with the NAV, audio, transmission, seats.


The seat is curved like an airplane's seat, the headrest pokes you in the back of the head forcing your head in an unatural position. 

Honda customer relations are useless.
The dealer does not believe the owners when complaining about the problems and even refuse to look at them more than once.

Look for "2013 Honda Accord Radio problems" in you tube.
Also, look at this thread: http://www.hondaaccordforum.com/forum/audio-visual-electronics-10/2013-accord-problems-nav-blutooth-51172/

2013 Honda Accord EX-L V6 Dislikes 
Internal hard drive Â Can only copy original music cds, you cannot copy any media files. This is terrible because most people purchase their music online so you do not have the original disc. The internal hard drive becomes useless.
Navigation, when you set a destination and start driving the only way to change it is by voice command, which almost never understands what you say. You have to stop the car in order to change it manually. Imagine being on the highway and you have to get off just to set your destination. This also makes your co-pilot useless.
7Â screen Â Poor music information layout artist, song title and album are laid out in such a way that 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Could not be more disappointed in Honda!
Quality control poor.
The most annoying part with my brand new car is the Audio module that intermittently (but most of the time) malfunctions.
Every time I switch from another module (Info, Navi, or Phone) to the Audio while driving, the frigging system thinks I just started the car, a black screen appears
 then HondaLink Logo and then a warning message about safe operation of the vehicle - the same sequence that appears when you first start the car.
All this paralyzes the system for 10-15 seconds, and only after that, finally, the Audio features reappear, with radio stations or XM. Worse, the sound loses stereo!!! and only the right side plays.

I've owned Hondas since 1983, i'm amazed how each new design is suprior to the others. This car is truly amazing in value. The price increase in minimal considering the new tech features & safety. It's got better performance, smoother ride, quieter & more comfortable. Anyone looking at a model in this class needs to drive one. Compare it to the other's in it's class. You will be amazed! Buy it.
