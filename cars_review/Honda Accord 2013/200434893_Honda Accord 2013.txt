Traded in a 99 Chevy Malibu for this (leased) car, and I wish I had the Chevy back.


Terribly rough ride, extremely shaky and loud over the tiniest bumps.
Potholes literally shake you to the point where you think the car will far apart! 

Even the AC in the 99 Chevy was better.

Any car I've ever driven or rode in has a smoother ride.
It's because with the 2013 models they dropped the wishbone suspension to save money.


I don't believe they tested the suspension, it's terrible, extremely unpleasant.
Not what you'd expect from a 'high-end' Accord.


Also, the car has started making shaking noises when I hit bumps, it's pretty disturbing for a new car.


AVOID THIS CAR !

Traded in my '13 Dodge Challenger R/T for this '13 Accord Coupe V6 and couldn't be happier. 

I've owned 20+ cars in my lifetime and have never been brand loyal to any manufacture. If I like the car, then I'll buy it. 

This car was used and 11k miles on it. Paint was almost flawless with a few small nicks in the front bumper but after some detailing and touch up paint, you can't see it any longer.

The vehicle has a sporty feel and quiet on the road although the suspension can be a little jarring on rough roads. Nice acceleration and doesn't make a lot of noise doing it (cough..Dodge..cough). I believe this car is almost as quick as my Challenger.

I purchased my Accord Coupe in May and took it in June on a 3000 mile road trip. I could not have been more pleased with the performance. The sound system does have a little quirkiness but definitely not a deal breaker. It has a comfortable ride but not luxurious. After a few hours on the road the seat seems hard, but my back was perfect. The styling is sporty and I believe the Honda reputation helped me choose this car over others I had considered. I have owned two other Hondas previously, a '92 Accord and an '01 CRV. Gas mileage is just as was presented on the sticker. With air conditioner running I get around 32-34 on the highway and 23-24 in town.

Overall great design & performance for the Money. Very disappointed with the reliability, and Honda service. Honda has by far the absolutely WORST customer service, I have ever experienced. Currently my Accord is back in the shop for going on four days, no updates, calls and the vehicle is still not fixed. Finally got a loaner on the third day,and dealt with rude, under trained associates who gave me a filthy loaner car, with no update on my vehicles repairs, instead it was still sitting exactly where it was towed. Can't wait to get it back so I can go get my 2014 Lexus Is

This review is for our 2013, Accord V-6 EX-L coupe.
We are third time accord owners, 1993 station wagon, a 2008 sedan and now our coupe.
We purchased a V-6 EX-L coupe in March 2013.
The Accord was purchased to replace our 2009 Infiniti G37S, and we are happy with the swap.

I just purchased on the 4th, car has 85 miles. Initial impressions- fit/finish/materials quality are among the best if the best combination in class. Ride, while not a quiet as some perhaps, is still plenty quiet and smooth enough without sacrificing handling. However comparing to my last car, a c5 corvette, just about anything would seem smooth to me :). 
-MSRP $30,070
-paid
$28.500
However I'm sure many in the mainland do $1-2k better than us here in Hawaii. 
 
-Hondacare 7yr./80,000 w/$100 Deductable- $895

So, FYI- shop the Hondacare Warranty price options online before you buy as you can save a lot in the Finance office. I am going to stop mine before it is submitted and get better.

Looked at and test drove a 2010 Accord Coupe, it was nice but too much road noise.
Was in the market again and the ride, power, and road noise were markedly better in the '13 than the previous Accords.
Interior leather and finishes are very nicely done. Getting 32 MPG combined (60% hwy miles).
Only problem is the audio system.
Having the same issue a lot of others are reporting with intermittent muted / distorted sound.
Message boards and forums are saying Honda is providing a firmware fix end of Feb first of March 13.
Let's hope so... very disappointing for only having the car 3 weeks!!
