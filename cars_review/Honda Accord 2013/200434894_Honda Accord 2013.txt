Two weeks, and 800 miles in, and I love this car. Despite my 60+ mile daily, roundtrip commute, my Prius was driving me crazy. No power, poor handling, and noisy! I wanted something that was going to be just as reliable, addressing all of my complaints about the Prius, still getting reasonably good mileage. I almost got the 4-cyl Accord, but I'm so glad I went for the V6. Even though I keep it in eco mode most of the time, there is always plenty of power on tap. At highway speeds, it's quiet, but you can still hear the engine growl when pressed. 

The fuel economy is within claimed range, and getting better with every tank. The infotainment system takes some getting used to.

The car itself is a fun car to drive. Looks and drives great. My complaint is that it come nowhere close to the mileage they claim in the city, at least not yet. Honda claims you should receive about 20 MPG in the city. These calculations are also based without the Econ button you can use which also, is supposed to increase mileage. My first tank of gas I got around 13.4 MPG, this was mostly city driving. Of coarse I called the dealer and I was told the car needed to be broke in, the computer needed to learn my driving habits. This would take 5000 miles for the car to be broke in and learn my habits. so far, not even close to claimed mileage. Look forward to buying another Infiniti.

I went from a Infiniti M35 to the 2013 Accord Coupe. I love the design of the car and it's a blast to drive. My complaint is this. I'm not getting anywhere near the mileage they claim to get in the city. I've even drove like a little ole man from Pasadena just to see if I could get it to improve. I'm getting like 13 or 14 MPG in the city, WITH THE ECON BUTTON ON. I've called the dealer and they claim that the car needs to break in, have at least 5000 miles on it. Well I sure hope this is true because as it stands now, I'd have kept my Infiniti and am counting the months until I can drop this Honda off at the dealer and go get another Infiniti.

After owning three Civics, I decided to try an Accord. This is the best Honda yet. Wish I bought one earlier. The car is a fully loaded EX-L V6. I assumed that gas mileage would be around 25 MPG. Since I owned it (Nov 2012), it's ranging from 28 to 34 MPG. I drive about 50/50 Hwy/City in Long Island, NY. On a trip from LI to Newport, RI, I averaged 34.1 MPG. I use the ECON setting for about 90% or driving. For power the V6 in Non-ECON, the car can keep up with vehicles costing much more. It is a poor man's BMW, but worth every penny of it.
