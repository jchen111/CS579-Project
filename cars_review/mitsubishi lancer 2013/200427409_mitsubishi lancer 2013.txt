Bought a new 2013 in June, and have done 15000 trouble free kilometers in the coldest Canadian winter for 50 years!

Car is used mainly for longer trips, including trip to Kelowna BC from Manitoba over Christmas. AWC system is excellent, sure footed,
and goes through snow when you would not think possible ( winter tyres fitted)
I love the flappy paddles to help select the right "gear" for the situation, or for that extra burst of acceleration.
 Heated seats are fantastic and very comfortable for a 12 hour drive, with plenty of support. The heater system is bionic !! 
The car looks fresh despite how long the body style has been around, and that big spoiler makes parking easy.
