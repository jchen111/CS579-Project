Have owned it for over a month now. The quality of interior and exterior is very good. The turbo responds well . I like the paddle shifters and the ability to temporarily switch to manual from automatic by using the paddle shifters when you need that extra power. The car is very easy to handle and responds well. But I am disappointed by the mpg. I am supposed to get 20/28 but I am getting 17 with 25% freeway / 75% city combination . I was hoping to get 21/22 at a minimum . I use premium gas (93) and I have already tried 3 different gas stations ( Exxon, Mobil, Sams). Do difference so far. I sold my MDX that was giving me 15 mpg for (25% freeway / 75% city combination ) and now I get 17 :( .

I purchased the 2013 Premium-Plus in October, 2012 and now have ten thousand miles and can give an objective overview.
Love the vehicle, the fit and finish is exceptional.
It's quiet, quick, nimble and tight when driving.
The suspension is quite nice, not to rough and no bounce whatsoever.
The only complaint is that the multimedia system is dated for a 2013 model, especially in this class segment.

Bought the 2.0T Premium Plus, with Navigation, 19" wheels and B+O Stereo in December 2012. 
The Edmunds review is dead on - this is a well-built, agile and luxurious car. 

I have a few nit-picks : the MMI system has a number of quirks - for example, upon startup, the car will reset the volume level (even if previously muted) and revert music playback to the beginning of the track that was playing when you parked, as opposed to the point in the track where you left off , which seems pointless to me;
also, the gas mileage has been less than the EPA figures (but I suppose many cars share that trait).

That being said, the joy of driving makes up for
these grumbles.

Bought it December 28, 2012. convenience package. Amazing car, i do not miss my last two 4Runners(03,11), love to drive that Crossover, great look, gas mileage is decent (91, 93), tiptronic is so cool, fun driving on manual or automatic sport or just D. Came with Michelin tires, do not have nav but the screen for radio and blue tooth is the same look and size.
Heated leather seat. takes time to know all the set up inside the car, just be patient you are in a Audi. Now i don't mind beeing stuck in traffic:)
