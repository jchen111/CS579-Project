Purchased 2013 Chysler 200 convertible from Mrytle Beach Chyrsler Jeep. With purchase price and taxes, etc. $35000. 6 weeks later, needed SUV for business. Went back to Myrtle Beach Chysler Jeep. They offered me $24000 for the car I bought frm them. They offered 24! Took car to Totota. The car is less than 6 months old, low miles and Toyota offered $14,000. The car is worth NOTHING. Chrysler is charging way too much for this car. I called Myrtle Beach Chyrsler Jeep and they offered $17,000 only because they sold me the car. No one wants this car, including Chrysler. No navigation, no USB for iPod. Horrible on gas. Just all around bad purchase. Worse case of buyers remorse ever.
