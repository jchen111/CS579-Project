I have been shopping the compact midsize crossover segment forever and have driven a fair number of the contenders in test drives or rentals. I finally pulled the trigger on an Outback 2.5i Limited.
The Outback may seem big, but it's very close to CR-V and RAV4 in size. It's an inch or two less tall and about 8 inches longer than cute-ute crossovers, with about 2 inches more in wheelbase. I think this gives the car a much more composed ride. Maneuverability is awesome.
Subarus have character that many cars lack. The 2.5i 4-cyl boxer is very reasonable in terms of power delivery, but it isn't your garden-variety 4 cylinder...it's quite smooth in operation though, especially w/CVT.

On December 30, 2013, I purchased a new Subaru from Ciocca Subaru in Wescosville.
In that short period of time, I have accumulated 2100 miles and have found the vehicle to be responsive and well-mannered in city and highway driving. The ride and handling for a vehicle of this size is excellent. Seats are firm and the cabin is relatively quiet. Interior materials seem to be of good quality. I appreciate the convenience of the winter package which incudes all-weather winter mats and a large rubber cargo mat w/ cargo net. As recommended, I check the oil every 400 miles and have no noticable consumption as the dipstick indicator still shows as full. Decent fuel mileage 23 city/30+ highway.
