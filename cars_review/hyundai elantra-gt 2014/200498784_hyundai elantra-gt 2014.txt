With dealer incentives, I was able to get an excellent deal on this base model Elantra GT which was already a good value before the incentives. I only have 100 miles on it so far, so this is more of a first impressions review, and the first thing I note is that I really liked the exterior styling. The Windy Sea Blue is really beautiful in the sunlight. On closer inspection, the fit and finish quality is outstanding. It's a very 'solid' car. Shut a door, and there is a reassuring thud of solidity. Interior controls are a bit busy. Still trying to figure things out, but the voice recognition is very helpful. 29.5mpg so far, but it's mostly in-town driving. Fun car to drive, and I'm happy!

I am leasing this car mostly because of the great deal that I got but more than likely will buy it out at the end of the lease. AWESOME gas mileage, I drive in the ECO mode all the time and consistanly get at least 36 mpg. I drive the speed limit but don't go over, so that make a big difference in the gas mileage.
Also I don't 'rabbit' start my car. The interior is roomy and very comfortable. Not a much space as my old 2005 Toyota Matrix but pretty close. LOVE the blue-tooth, I will never go without that option again. Car has plenty of speed and power, will be anxious to see how it does in the snow.
