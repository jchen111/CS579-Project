We have a 2006 Elantra GT (and are keeping it for a while longer), which my wife loves to drive, so when it came time to replace our 2006 Sonata (another great car, BTW), we looked at the 2014 Elantra GT. Not only does this year's model have 173 HP, but the 6 speed auto is delightful.
We got the Pano sunroof, leather (Driver seat is power) and dual zone air.
The car is quiet, smooth, darn good power and decent on fuel. a couple of thou on the odo so far, not a single glitch. The styling is great and space is terrific. Bigger than the Mazda 3 and more reliable than the Focus. We wanted power seat and this was the only one that could do it at a decent price.
