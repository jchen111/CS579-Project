Got my wife an Ingot Silver '14 Mustang convertible a few weeks ago to replace her aging Taurus.
Nothing but smiles every time she talks about it.
Weather permitting, she drives everywhere with the top down and enjoys the comments she gets about her car.
It is quick and smooth and the miles just melt away when going on road trips with the sun shining and the top down.
Hands down the most FUN car in thirty plus years of buying cars together.
Low front end caught her a few days ago when she pulled into a parking spot and drove the front end up onto a curb popping a bunch of things loose in the front end...minimum of $1050 to repair but still waiting to get it back and see the full bill.

Wow ! Driving a 2014 V6 Convertible around Central Florida is FUN ! There are compromises - V6 for regular gas, automatic tranny more practical when I4 is a parking lot. BUT - this car hugs the road, loves curves, accelerates & brakes smoothly. I enjoy the handling as much as my wife appreciates the smooth ride. Still learning to use the SYNC, but I'm getting there.
