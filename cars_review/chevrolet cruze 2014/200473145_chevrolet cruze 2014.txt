This month I purchased a gas Cruze Eco with the six speed manual.
I just filled up the tank and checked the gas mileage.
I got 39 mpg!
That was all around driving, although the majority was highway.
Then I drove 98 miles all highway at 62 mph, twice aggressively passing and negotiating some hills.
I filled up and it only took 2 gallons!
49 mpg!
I am very happy so far.

It handles well and isn't underpowered.
My 2004 impala 3.8 which I traded in for this had a better ride and more passing power, but I don't think I lost much in these areas.
I am very happy.
My advice:
learn how to use a manual:>)
