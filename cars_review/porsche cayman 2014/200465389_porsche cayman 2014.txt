I had a 2010 Cayman S, great vehicle, Edmunds is spot on about the steering, it was better in the old model.
But the new 2014 model is much more comfortable and forgiving on last distance runs.
The NAV / Bose Sound System / Interior much better than previous model.
Handling is exceptional and exterior looks greatly improved.
My only issue is that I bought a dealer demo with 750 miles.
It was delivered to me W/O inspection.
Had problems with power seat & unbalanced tires.
One of the tires I found a nail in it and cost me $446 to get a new one.
Avoid The Collection in Miami.

I just bought a 2014 Cayman S. Base price $63,800.00 after options sticker was over $ 84,000.00. The only negative about this car. But no regrets. I can't say how much I love this car. The feeling you get when you get behind the wheel and turn the key and hear that engine behind you is a like a natural high. And when you get it out on the road and hit the pedal in Sports Plus the rush is amazing. This car has all the power you need. Actually you can't really get to enjoy it because there is not many roads that you can really take advantage of what this car can deliver. This is my second Cayman. First was a 2007 Cayman Base. The difference in the 2014 is amazing. A total different car.
