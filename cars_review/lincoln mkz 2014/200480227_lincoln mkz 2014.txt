I bought one with Panaromic roof. Yesterday, a good friend of mine saw this car for the first time and he was in awe with that car. With that note, he was about to get off from the front passenger seat. Since the car has a lower seating and the door was far from him to hold on to, he held on to the top frame of the car with his right hand fingers over the roof that I had just opened to display. With rain coming, I decided to close it with his fingers still on. The glass roof rolled over his fingers just as tight as one can imagine. His 3 fingers are now fractured. Owners of the car with this roof, please be aware that this could happen to you or someone with you.

We traded our A6 Audi for the MKZ hybrid and couldn't be happier. We took delivery in Arizona and after about 300 miles drove it to Minnesota. We find the seating more comfortable than the Audi but we did get the messaging seats because of my wife's back trouble.
We averaged 40.2 on the trip and now at 3000 miles it is at 41.
We have had two shorter trip gas fills with one at 48 and one at 44, but I have to say that we live in a rural area with a lot of 55 mph roads and we have paid close attention to acceleration and braking. I appreciate the lack of a shifter since they only connect to wires anyway.
The interior is very attractive and close to the Audi's quality.

Love this car, but there are some things that could use improvement. First off this is a car you buy because you love the way it looks period. Its not fast and its not suppose to be, if your looking for performance try the non hybrid ecoboost or buy a German brand. I love the Germans, I've owned an Audi, two BMW's and a Mercedes and all were fantastic cars. This definitely is different, its uniquely American in that it has more road feel than your typical Japanese luxury car will have however not as much as the Germans. Id say its nicely in the middle. Personally the styling on the top tier trim level MKz beats the pants off any Lexus ES which is its main compeditor.

Previous 3 new cars have been Acura TL's. Loved them but wanted better mileage and to get away from premium gas. I've owned the MKZ for 6 months and put 7,500 Chicago miles on it. Seems winter mileage (mixed city and hiway) 38 to 40. Now, April, running about 42 MPG, Very satisfied with that , but may get even better during summer. Love the lines and ride. Tech controls a bit too sensitive and complex. So far, VERY satisfied.

Disappointed in the mpg. sheet states 45mpg. Dealership rechecked 04/01/2014 for mpg and no problems found to justify why I'm only getting
34.3mpg. I'm going back to Audi,VW,Honda or Toyota. I've own these vehicles before and they live up to their build sheet. American brand name vehicles are flawed and people selling them are either more enterested in selling the car than telling the truth or they don't know enough about the product their selling. Price too high for really what your getting.

I almost brought a Cadillac until I saw that Lincoln Hybrid was the same price as the non Hyb.
I have this car three months and it is comfortable, fun to drive looks good too. The electronics are not at all confusing as some pro reviewers have suggested, nor does it make noise when converting to gas from battery. Study the manual a bit and the electronics will become intuitive.
The extra space provided by push button gears and no shift handle is awesome. I have compared this to friends' BMW and Benz and the Lincoln actually has some better features. The audio system being one. THX audio rocks. Crisp and clear sound.

I am absolutely pleased that I purchased this automobile.
5 years interest free is a nice incentive.
It is the most comfortable car I have ever owned.
I still learning all the bells and whistles.

I love the exterior styling on the MKZ and the lines of the vehicle are beautful. I love the look and feel of the handling. The fit and finish is amazing and the sound quility is the best. The ride is what I expected it to be excellent. Sure there are more expensive vehicles out there but I think Lincoln has come a long way with the design and build of the new MKZ. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't owned a Ford product since 1984 (to me this is more Ford than Lincoln) and have owned no American vehicles since 1996.
I have been dying to come back to American cars and this was to have been the triumphant return for me.
While I was wowed by the exterior design, it stops for me there.
I am 6ft tall and mid fifties.
I think the new average buyer's age.
I bump my head every time I get in the car (roof too short).
Lumbar support is poor, quality of the leather interior is not plush and comfortable (what I consider luxury is a plush interior) and I have never once gotten 40 mpg much less higher.
I do not drive over 70 on the highway and am definitely not a speeder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I previously owned a Cadillac CTS, but I like the MKZ Hybrid much more.
I'm glad someone finally recognizes there is a market for this kind of car.
I respect that others want high-performance road racing cars, but I prefer a quiet, posh ride.

The technology is unbelievable.
The reviewers mention the computerized continually adjusting dampening system, but they don't mention that it "learns" along with brakes, acceleration, you driving habits, and road conditions to improve over time.
The cabin tech is out of this world--not enough space here to even begin.
