Through 30 yrs had 5 BMWs, 2 Benz, 2 Jags & an Audi.
ALL tire eaters.
ALL ugly brake dust a wk after wash.
All Premium gas.
Most had me in the SERVICE depts on a reg. basis.
BMW the worst. (Over-tech-ed)

Got tired of it all in '07 & tried an MKZ.

Cheaper to buy of course and luxury perks suffered but was pissed off.


Then, things like REGULAR gas, no brake dust, tires getting 46k miles rather than 20k, free oil changes, rotations etc and NO PROBLEMS mechanically inspired the next one & so on.

The car keeps improving & current one's the best so far.
DON'T believe reviewers trashing after a day with the car. ASK OWNERS you see on the street then test drive.
SUPPORT USA!

Ford, and now Lincoln Motor Company will never admit it but they now offer us vehicles that drive themselves. Between the available Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Keep Assistance I have in my 2013 103A Zephyr, I'm driving with more confidence than ever. My wife and I took delivery today, we chose the Ecoboost in a FWD as we have quite the commute. She had three stipulations: Has to have the BLISS, Rear Camera and Rear Sensors that I currently have in my Fusion. I can never live without them, she stated. My only stip was the Adaptive Cruise because of our inconsistent traffic in the metro area, I easily get frustrated with the stop, start, increase speed, CONTINUED under Favorite features:
