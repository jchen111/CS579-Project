After looking at luxury sedans for about a year, I traded my Bimmer for the Equus without a second thought.  The Equus was the first car I got into for a test ride that I felt was more comfortable than the 745.  

It uses regular gas, gets comparable mileage, is as quiet, comfortable and well equipped as the 745i - for 10s of thousands less. Add the superior warranty and valet service (I haven't been to the dealer for service in nearly 4 years!)  

Only two demerits: less than stellar iPod implementation (on an otherwise outstanding audio system) and handling that's more boat like than Bimmerish.  I'll keep the 2011 until Hyundai delivers an AWD Equus.

If you have owned a Lexus, I don't think you'll be satisfied with the Equus.
I am at 4 months of ownership, 2800 miles, and there are quite a few paint chips on the rocker panels due to stepping in and out of the car.
It's obviously not just me, because they are on both sides.
Lexus has a metal plate where Equus has a piece of painted plastic. That's an engineering flaw in my book.
I'm being told this isn't warrantable because it was caused by the user.
I also have a small tear on the leather on the drivers's side door. i don't have the space to discuss the buying "experience" but it's not one I will repeat...with bait and switch by 1 dealer and addition of BS charges by another.

I bought the 2014 Equus Signature, black with tan interior, just a great car. I shopped the Mercedes S550, BMW 750 and the Lexus 460 before making my decision on this purchase. Realistically there is no comparison, this car rocks the competition. The interior of the Equus is awesome, the seats are exceptionally comfortable, the controls are nicely positioned and the stereo is tremendous. The interior amenities are as they should be in a car of this class. The fit and finish is comparable to the cars costing $40K more. The performance is similar to both the S550 and the BMW 750 in acceleration, the ride is more closely related to the S550. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a car
