After looking and wondering why any one would spend 80,000 to 120,000 on a German or Japanese
luxury car I have come to the conclusion the world is full of idiots. My 2014 equus is so close in all categories that the thought of spending big bucks on  the German or Japanese luxury cars makes me laugh. They are all just cars and nothing more . I drove them all then looked at the window sticker and just laughed. The only one that made sense was the equus.

After owning 14 Equus about 10month, I feel like I havebeen scammed by Germans more than 15years.
