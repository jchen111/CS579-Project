The Subaru WRX Sti limited was about what I expected.
I bought the care to be my daily driver.
It is very fun to drive and more comfortable than I would have expected.
Paying the extra money for the limited package was well worth it.
Heated seats adds some extra comfort in the winter time, and the sunroof will be nice in the summer.
I'm not impressed with the stereo system, but I can easily be remedied with some aftermarket additions.

Most hard core performance buyers are not looking at Edmunds, but I did not like several things they said in their review. In the performance category, not much besides a supercar offers as much performance for the dollar than the STI. The AWD, SI Drive, and adjustable differentials, and 6 speed transmission are world class. The interior uses cheaper materials, but this is based in the Impreza platform. You buy a STI for the performance not to impress any one. Right now Subaru has a 4 month waiting period to get a STI or WRX, so someone must be wanting them. 

I enjoy everyday I hop into my STI and get to make going places and experience. The factroy NAV/SAt system sounds pretty good to me.
