Best car I've ever owned.
I have had Corvettes, Jags, Benzes and a multitude of others, but by far my favorite is the 135i convertible.
It is a fun, peppy car that strikes an almost perfect balance between ride/handling--and this is with the sport package.
Mine has the DCT transmission--it works flawlessly and is so intuitive I rarely use the manual function.
Handling is superb.
The ride is a bit rough with the OE run-flats.
I swapped mine out for non-run-flat Michelins right away--the ride is much improved.
IMO, BMW should do away with OE run-flats.
They are horrible.

This 135i convertible with M Sport package is one of the most---no, make that THE MOST FUN--car I have ever owned, and I have owned many, including Jaguars, Corvettes, and Porsches, to name a few.
Fantastic engine pulls strong from a dead stop to 7k rpms.
DCT transmission is a blast.
Handling is sharp.
This thing scoots around like a Miata on steroids.
The only thing I dislike about this car are the run-flat tires, which I switched out after one week for some non-run-flat Michelins--this immediately improved the ride tremendously.
 I think this may be the best car BMW makes.
