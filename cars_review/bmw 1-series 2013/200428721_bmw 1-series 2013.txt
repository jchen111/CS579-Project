I bought a 2003 Z4 ten years ago and thoroughly enjoyed driving it for 55,000 miles.
At the age of 52, it was a great purchase.
At 62, with bad knees, and 6'3", it became more difficult to get in and out of.
And, being a roadster with a small trunk, it wasn't good for more than a quick overnight trip.
So, we traded it on a '13 128i convertible and so far, it's a wise decision.
Had to special order it since I wanted a manual transmission and was willing to pay only for the options I wanted.
Only 1000 miles so far, so it's too soon to determine reliability.
The fit and finish is typical BMW qaulity and the engine and transmission are smooth.
