I have had my new 2014 Silverado for a few months now. Here is the build configuration:
LT
Double Cab
4x4
5.3L V-8 
All-Star Package
Bed Liner
33,000 out the door (after tax)
Disclaimer, I have driven similar versions of Ram and Fords 2014 trucks. I have actually always owed Fords up until this point of my life. 
This truck just does everything perfect. When I test drove the Ram and Ford, the Silverado just seemed like everything was put together in a way that made it feel like the entire truck is made out of one piece, aka, German sedan like. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would stay away from this model until Chevy fixes serious defect in build quality. I bought my truck about a month ago. On test drive before signing paperwork I mentioned to the salesperson a loud humm at speeds over 30 mph. We thought it was tires breaking in. Well, after a month of aggrevating
noise, took it back to dealer. Service states something in rear was over torqued and bearings need replacing. At 1900 miles!!!!
So now, my truck has been in dealer shop for a week because Chevy claims part is on "back order"!!!!
This is a new truck!
Meanwhile I've got work that I can't get done.
If Chevy is reading this my case number is 711251316207
