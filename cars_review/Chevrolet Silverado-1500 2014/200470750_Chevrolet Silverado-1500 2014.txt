I looked at dodge, ford and Chevrolet and choose the Chevrolet for price. I now have 700 miles on my truck with no mechanical issues or ride issues and is very comfortable and fun to drive. the only problem I have had is keeping the tire pressure up but that's because of the cold weather. I have plenty of power and great fuel economy with the 4-8 set up. the transmission works great and is very smooth, so smooth I don't even feel it shift but know its working great by watching the tachometer. Now Edmunds doesn't list my actual truck I bought. It's a 2014 crew cab Z71 LT 4X4 6'6'' box with the 5.3 motor. Have the 8'' touch screen love it. Great Truck!!!
