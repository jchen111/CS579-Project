After looking for several months, I finally decided to lease a 2013 Buick Regal Turbo Premium 2.
Need HID headlights and the Premium 2 trim level was required.
I researched and drove the Honda Accord Touring, Ford Fusion, Malibu 2LTZ, BMW 3 series, MB C 250, Kia Optima, and the Nissan Altima.
The Buick Regal surpassed all of them in comfort, features, ride quality, build quality, handling, luxury, and especially quietness.
A quiet comfortable car is paramount for me and the Buick Regal provides that at a reasonable price point.
I am completely impressed with this car.
Traded in my Cadillac DeVille, known for comfort and quiet, and have not regretted my decision.
The Regal is great.
