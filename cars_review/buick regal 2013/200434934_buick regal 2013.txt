I bought a 2013 Regal GS in March of 2013.
 the driving dynamics are awesome, the car handles all kinds of curves and road conditions excellently.
I honestly think GM should use the Hy-per-Strut in more vehicles as it gives you confidence, traction and very minimal torque steer.

The car was wonderful, it took care of my pregnant wife, drove across country 3600 miles in the summer averaging 27 mpg for the trip, (great while cruising 75-80 mph)

and still had plenty of power for passing when needed.
