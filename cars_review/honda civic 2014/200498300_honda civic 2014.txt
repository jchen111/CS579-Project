April, I bought a 2014 EXL honda civic.
I had a list what the car must have.
Gas mileage was top on the list.
I live 30 miles from town, all 75 miles hi-way.
I use cruse, Econ button, and and stay in the green dash light.
I have yet to see 40 mpg or even close to that mileage.
The car has 3000+ miles and the Dealer said the car would get better mileage with the summer gas and once the car passed 1500 miles
The car is averaging 27/33.
