The Range Rover sport is in my view an over priced V6 powered ego trip.
The poorly designed interior layout coupled with the least intuitive gps and entertainment system out there should give anyone pause. And why does the gps system point upward into to the sun?
The small screen is hard enough to deal with, let alone the excessive sun light!
Additionally you'll find that although Land Rover claims there SUV as being the best off road vehicles in the world, it's interesting why there tires only offer about 3/16 to 1/4" clearance for the rim.
The best drivers will still curb the rims.
When it's time for breaks, 30k miles.
Expect to pay 1000 dollars per axle. Oh, oil and tire rotate, 300
