Traded Mercedes C300 and a Ram 1500 Hemi, and traded both on the Sierra.
Mine is an SLE Doublecab with the All-Terrain package and 5.3 V8.

I've only had it for 1000 miles so can't really comment on reliability, but truck is very solid going down the road, whisper quiet, smooth, luxurious and just a joy to drive.
Its actually more comfortable than the 2011 Mercedes was.

The 8" touchscreen stereo with Bose speakers (not listed on sticker or GMC site for SLE, but came with my All-Terrain) sounds great, but the bluetooth and USB connections to my iPhone 5s are a bit flakey.
No NAV in my truck, but OnStar works well.

Drove 400 miles yesterday, heated bucket seats very comfortable.

Well I have owned this truck for almost 6 months and have had ZERO issues and one recall to check transmission line leaks and none found.
My last truck was a 2013 Chevy Silverado and this truck is a far better vehicle! It drives better has a better turning radius and just has a better feel driving it. I have owned numerous other trucks Fords, Dodges (junk) and Toyota's and they do not equal this truck. I see other reviews that do not have good things to say but I really LIKE this truck! I tow a small bass boat and it pulls it great. The gas mileage is better than my 2013 Chevy but I have yet to hit the 22mpg highway. Hope this helps someone looking at this truck!
