Great overall design and gas mileage for a family vehicle.

bought this used, <7k in January.
it a big improvment over my 08 Mazda 5.
The rear room is the same, but the mpg is 2x of Mazda 5! i have hubby, a toddler and 2 mutts.
all of us fit just fine.
Hubby loves it.
it has planty of room for him (6'2") the entune sys is good.
i just wish it would remember the settings so that i don't have to press a dozen buttons just to get pandora to play.
i avg out 42.4mpg (fuelly)
 my computer tells me its almost XX, but its alway -3 of what the computer says.
not sure why.
love the low maintenence vs Jetta's.
just tire rotation and oil change.
i'll be keeping this one for over 5 yrs for sure!

I bought this wagon for the cargo space, gas mileage, and it's a Toyota which holds its value well. The interior cargo space is about the same as a small SUV but with much better gas mileage.
I am averaging 38-42, and that's driving at the speed limit. Plenty of head and leg room (I'm 5'9). Voice command can be slow at times, hatch door is heavy to close, a lot of little extras missing for such an expensive car such as (sun visor extensions, rear a/c, remote use for hatch door, only one power adapter plug in the front). Aside from it's several flaws, I still love it!
Great alternative to the small gas guzzling SUVs! However, if you are looking for a fun and fast car, this is not it.

I am one of the few, I imagine, that went from a German built VW Golf (not TDI) to a Prius V.
Why on earth would someone do that?
I wanted to get out of the lease game, and purchase.
VW has great driving cars and great lease deals, but I wanted to eventually not have car payments.
That said, I am thrilled with the Prius V.
Don't be influenced by reviews that say it has no power.
Plenty of power especially in power mode.
I only use power mode in heavy traffic and I have to make a quick maneuver.
I had to use the sport mode on the Golf for that anyway.
This car is very comfortable, great lumbar support in the driver's seat.
Gobs of cargo room and the ride is firm but not jerky at all

Could have been a better car. 

Driving Controls are ok. I don't even mind the central gauge cluster, but it looks looks horrible.
The infotainment system is slow.
The nav in my 10 year old BMW was faster at imputing destinations and finding routes.
It has a resistive touchscreen which is also horrible.

The Prius power train is not very refined carrying around the extra weight.
A boat-like feeling at any speed and numb numb numb, but above 60 mph, the car has an unsettling unstable feeling.
 Brakes are overly grippy at low speeds and mushy at high.

Besides my gripes, it is excellently packaged.
It carries what I need it to carry and gets north of 40 mpg in mixed driving.

Our Chevy just used too much gas so we traded for a Prius V.
Since we already own a hybrid we were not surprised or troubled by some of the things people mention here regarding acceleration, etc.
We have found the fit and finish of the car to be excellent - the materials are what we would expect in a vehicle that was designed to maximize fuel economy.
Everything works beautifully from the Nav to the radio - it is simple, intuitive and well designed.
I am 6 feet tall and have no trouble being comfortable in the driver's, front passenger's or rear passenger's seats (which recline!).
The cargo space is truly amazing - we love this car and recommend it highly!
