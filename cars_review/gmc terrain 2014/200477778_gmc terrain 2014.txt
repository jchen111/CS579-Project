Very comfortable ride & seating. Quiet ride. Great sounding radio & phone connections when needed. Only have 5,000 miles on the car.

Four cylinder engine is somewhat anemic, but adequate for my type of driving.
My other car is a Jaguar XK, thus statisfying my need for speed.

I have 3400 miles on our Terrain & so far mostly satisfied with the car.
No issues with reliability & getting 31 mpg hwy. 23/24 mpg overall.
Just wish it had a few more standard amenities like: glove box & foot well courtesy lights, safety reflectors or red lights on the side of door body visible when door is opened and automatic release for rear hatch. My wife is short & needs a "pull" to close rear hatch as it opens too high for her.
