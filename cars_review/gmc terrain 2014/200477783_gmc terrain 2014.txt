Well, the test drive went pretty well. That is because it was at night. I leased the vehicle for 39 months and then realized what a big mistake. There are NO vents for the air conditioning in the back seat area. Not even on the center console. NONE. And to make matters worse, if the ECO button is pressed, it makes the fan speed go slow so there is very little air flow. 
This has got to be the worst engineering mistake since the Corvair. Can you imagine the heat in South Florida and your passengers in the back seat are dying from lack of ventilation due to this engineering mistake. I could not imagine 3 people sitting in my back seat even though it does say seating for 3 in the back.
