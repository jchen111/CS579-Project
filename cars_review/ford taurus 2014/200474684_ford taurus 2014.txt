Traded in my 09 Buick Enclave for this. As everyone knows, nothing rides like a Buick. I can finally see everything at a 4 way stop. This car has everything for music lovers! My USB port is loaded with over 800 songs. Personalized pictures etc. the technology here is amazing!! Nice highway ride, not as nice as the Buick but I doubled my gas mileage!! Seats are comfortable, handles excellent. Red exterior, Sand interior. What a head turner! Navigation is a little weird but I just send directions to my car from Mapquest. You can somewhat even customize your dashboard and even ask for gas prices and it will come up on your screen!

2.0 Ecoboost I4. Rated at 32 mpg. Car averages 23-25 mpg highway on premium after 8240 miles. I commute 110 mi/day. Driver assist package is the worst. 15 menu clicks to turn on std cruise control instead of adaptive - defaults to adaptive when the car is shut off. Sony stereo sounds tinny, no bass. Many Sync issues. Can't use it on accessory power. It shuts off automatically and sends a message to start the engine if you want to use the system. Phone doesnt connect consistently after paired. This after new update. Only 2/3 of the heated steering wheel is heated, not the top 1/3. Can't use any climate button on console wearing gloves! Exhaust smell in stop/go traffic sucked in by the heater.
