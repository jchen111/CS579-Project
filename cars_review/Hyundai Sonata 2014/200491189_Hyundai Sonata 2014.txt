I picked up a 2014 GLS after several rides in a friend's 2013. All the current tech gizmos are there including butt warmers and a hi-res backup camera. The ride is comfortable and secure, handling is very good. Visibility is only average as the seating seems a bit low. The transmission has an "Eco" setting which works great on the highway but is annoying around town; regular mode delivers 25 mpg anyway in a 50/50 mix.
