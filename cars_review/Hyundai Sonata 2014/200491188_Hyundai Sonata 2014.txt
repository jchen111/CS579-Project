I rented a base model with only 300 miles on it.
I'm a tough reviewer, but this car really impressed me.
I loved the dash - Hyundai made the controls very simple and intuitive - so you'll never get angry at the car because you can't figure out how to work the climate control, cruise control, etc.
At highway speed there is zero wind noise (amazing).
The quietness, ride smoothness, comfy seats, cold and powerful AC and the quality look and feel to everything are reminiscent of the 1990's Camry's we all loved.
Toyota doesn't make a Camry with uncompromised comfort and refinement anymore so it's neat to know the Hyundai does and it's called the Sonata 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 gas mileage not what was advertised transmission shifts into higher gears at the wrong time. took it back to dealer and was told it is running as designed. that is there standard answer instead of trying to fix it. complained to Hyundai and that was a waste of time. beware of the advertised fuel mileage, although I am sure it is an industry wide problem of not getting what is advertised as far as gas mileage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are very happy with our new car.
Shortly after we purchased it we drove it on a long trip.
We got 34 MPG on the highway at Texas interstate speeds, 75 MPH+, and close to 30 MPG in city driving.
We are still getting used to all of the functions it has to offer.
