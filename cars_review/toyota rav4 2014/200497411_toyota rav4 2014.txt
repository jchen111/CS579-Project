The Rav 4 has had 25 recalls, which should say it all.  I have had to replace both front and rear brakes at only 50k miles.  The sensors went at 25k.  The battery died at 49k.  The front end is so far out of alignment that I must replace tires every 16000 miles or drive on badly, unevenly worn tires.  I have had the car to 3 different alignment shops which verify the car is badly out of alignment.  This is an unfixable problem. Unfortunately it still falls within Toyota's specs.  I guess it is easier to change specs than admit this problem should also have been recalled.  I have also had repeated computer problems.  I feel that this car is unsafe to drive and a money pit.

Recently traded a 2003 Hyundai Santa fe for the 2014 RAV4. Based mostly on price I leased the car, it's okay but styling is boring, ride is firm, interior is cheap. If a Hyundai dealer would have been closer to home I think I would have stayed with the Hyundai, or a KIA. Inconvenient storage(coins, phone). Seat fold downs in back are okay, but the front seat could have been included to maximize full length hauling . The doors sound cheap/hollow when you close them. Overall a little disappointed, I have never owned a Toyota before, don't think I would get one again.
