 I had a 2006 Mini. Same MPG as my CRZ but used premium. The CRZ has proven to be more practical for stuff than the Mini was for me. 
Traded the Mini in 18 months on an Prius. 50 MPG--but--BORING !! No driver connection at all. Makes the CRZ feel like an Elise!
My CRZ is base with a CVT-- BUT paddle shifters and sport mode and this buggy can zoom down a twisty country road with great aplomb and put a smile on an road course instructors face too.
I have been getting 38-42 MPG per tank as well.
I've tested the Fiesta, Focus and some Asian itty-bittys. The CRZ is much sportier as a momentum car, not a point and squirt car like most car magazine reviewers want. I just wish it was RWD.

 The CRZ is a rare mix of Hybrid MPG and sport mode. The 3 mode driving system is really convenient. You can switch between the modes at any time during your drive. The 2013 comes with a more powerful lithium ion battery this year, as well as S+ button for a 5 second burst of speed, and a back up camera. 
Some of the negatives:
-Rear window visibility(backup camera helps)
-No armrest in the center(Although you can buy a slide in accessory)
-No locking gas flap
Overall, I really love this car. When you sit in the cockpit, the blue panel looks really futuristic. Even though I'm getting better MPG, I think I'm spending more on gas because I want to find reasons to drive it.

I have only had my CR-Z for two months, but I love it.
I owned a 1985 CRX-SI, and the CR-Z is the flower child of the CRX with current tech functionality.
When looking for a new vehicle, my main requirement was it had to be PURPLE, and the Passion Berry Pearl is a beautiful deep/dark purple.
The continuously variable transmission is an adjustment, since I always drove a manual transmission, but I enjoy not having to use a clutch.
I am still waiting to get the mileage mentioned on the Honda website, but most of my driving so far has been city driving, with lots of hills and stop and go.
Still, I am averaging 30 mpg.
I look forward to my first road trip to test the fuel efficiency.
