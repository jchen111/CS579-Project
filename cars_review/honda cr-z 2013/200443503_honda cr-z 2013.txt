Yes, I sold my 08 BMW M3, which was a beast. But I got sick of spending $73 for gas 2.5 times per week on my 55 miles to work. 

I got the CR-Z because I wanted a hybrid but still have some fun. 

The car teaches you how to drive efficiently. It's like playing a video game while driving. 

My 1+ hour commutes are over in NO TIME now. Not because I'm going faster, but because I'm having more fun. It's awesome. (This is also because the CR-Z EX has an AMAZING stereo. Sound is unbelievable. 

The EPA estimates on MPG are WAY off. I just got over 53 MPG the other day in economy mode! 

I love that I can drive in econ mode but hit the S+ button for full electric power to pass!

when you look at the stats and specs
that this car is givin its misleading. saying its not fast enuf or the gasmilage isnt what its supost to be, i must disagree i got the 6mt and was told 31-38 thats not what im getting im up to 43 avg. and the 0-60 they claim im blowing it away and i havent even givin it all its got its about 6 sec witch is faster then any car in its price range the sport and eco buttons make a huge diffrence and the s+ gives you something extra too. i think if honda and other companies would have tested it properly they would have sold more. i wasnt going to buy it after looking up online reviews but after testing it i couldnt refuse its far more then they give it credit

My son needed a new car.
After test driving the Ford Fiesta and checking out the Veloster and Civic SI, he decided on a cr-z and we are happy he did.
The car gets very good gas mileage for around town (average 34.1 with a/c running most of the time and usually in normal mode).
You can't go by the EPA mileage rates because that doesn't take into consideration the option to drive in Econ mode to increase fuel efficiency.
Look up what actual drivers are posting for what they are getting and you will be surprised.
We have the 2014 ex with the lithium ion batteries.
Car has plenty of pep in normal mode and is really fun to drive so I don't know what the reviewer is comparing it to.
