Leased this car after Hyundai Genesis & I wanted a more engaging chassis & I certainly got strong capable handling.

I HATE the terrible dash & electronics setup & contrast with Genesis was shocking.
iPod integration, NAV, route management, radio presets are so poorly done on the Lexus that you will hardly use them. Most everything is many extra clicks to do anything and then still works badly. Steering wheel controls poor

E.g. media player jumps from tracks w/o regard to artist or album. Car beeps when lights set to auto and you open the door. older iPod shows up as USB & then says no songs.

Great driving car, but you won't get much value out of the dash. Test before buying
