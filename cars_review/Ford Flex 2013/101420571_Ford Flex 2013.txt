I was looking at a couple SUV's and the Explorer was the last one on my list.
Having owned a Scion xB in the past the salesman said I should look at the flex and I am so glad I did!
Gets better gas mileage, better price, less money for more and I LOVE the appearance package.
I opted for the SEL, Nav, 201A package, Ruby Red with black roof, tow hitch, and Appearance package.
MSRP: $38,550.
With the free Appearance package incentive, rebates, and some negotiation I paid just under $34K.
I never thought I could get such a loaded SUV/crossover for such a great price.
Super happy with the look and the spacious interior. Love all the feature of the Sync system!
