I just got the wife a 2014 Sequoia limited and its by far the best vehicle I've owned. (I've had a couple of Mercedes before).
It addresses all of the comfort and safety issues that a family of 5 could ask for.
The new Entune compatibility is the best with the smart phone connection and bluetooth capabilities.
The computer will pick up your phone's music and just start playing it when prompted.
The 4 wheel drive rocks too!
Pulled my brother in law out of a ditch in the snow (had a two wheel drive truck) and I had him out before the wife knew what was going on.
You're going to pay for this Truck as they are not cheap but its well worth the $ to get the comfort, reliability and
quality
