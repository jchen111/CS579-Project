Purchased my new 2014 Toyota Tacome V6 w/ Tow Pckg in April of this year.  Been on a few trips this year.  Getting a new vehicle was huge for me, of my own, as was getting a truck!  I love love love having my own truck.  And I have loved Toyotas in the past.  So my heartbreak is quite profound regarding my experience. 

Interior comfort is horrible.  The design of the seats is such that it makes a person hunch forward, and this cannot be alleviated with raising or lowering the headrest, or by adjusting the lumbar knob which really doesn't do much besides adjust the firmness of the seat behind your lower back.  After 2.5 hours on the road, my back was screaming in pain.  After 7, in tears. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have owned 3 of the the Tacoma product as well as an FJ and a Land Cruiser. I looked at all the choices out there when it came to spending approx $40,000 on a new vehicle. I ended up wiht a 2014 Tacoma TX Baja Access Cab in white. $37,605++
This truck is a whole lot of bang for the buck. The ergonomics are very well thought out from a drivers perspective. The seating is very non fatiguing on trips. The footprint is really what attracted me to this again as its a truck you can hop in and park anywhere, even a Trader Joes parking lot. You can also find and access a whole lot of trails a full size truck can not. the weight is such that you wil not get bogged down off road. 
TX Baja = Smiles
