The base model makes a great commuter or single person/small family. With the 5 speed manual, it has oodles of power and handling is precise. Seats are very comfortable in front, cloth is high quality, and trans shifts very smoothly. Seat height is easy to adjust, the telescoping wheel helps driving position. What's lacking in the base model is power windows, CD (why?-never use)/sync, cruise. Fortunately Ford included an aux jack for phone or ipod. With the high cost of used cars these days, a new '13 was only about $2K more than similarly equipped 11's. A no brainer!

First off I want to state that I am 5 foot 8 and 270lbs.
I just lost a 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis that this 2013 Fiesta replaced
I could not get over how comfortable I am in and driving the vehicle
Great and fun to drive
I actually dont miss my grand marquis
I cant believe that I actually just wrote that but this Fiesta is just about perfect I wish Ford would advertise this car more
It is a superior value and just great to drive.
Down falls are the automatic transmission that is rough to get used to and back seat room but hey I dont sit in the back seat
The S should still come with a CD player and an interior truck release but these are the only complaints
Great job Ford.

So far I have 16K miles of my 2013 Ford Fiesta S Sedan and I have been pleased overall.
I am consistenly acheiving 42+ mpg due to the rural area I live in as well as my driving habits such as driving the speed limit, gentle stops and starts, and running the AC only when the interior temperature becomes too warm to bear. The ride is firm but forgiving, and much nicer than one would expect a compact car to have. The engine seems very smooth and powerful for its size. Handling feels tight and precise. The automatic transmission (really an automated manual) seems somewhat clunky and makes unusual noises, but so far it has not given me any trouble. Very little rear seat room, but lots for cargo.
