we purchased our first new car, very exciting.. First year burned through oil, a lot of oil!
dealer said this was normal, we weren't checking properly, might have a problem.
did oil consumption test, obviously a problem 1 quart every 700 miles.
Subaru talerance is 1/3 quart every 1000?
Subaru replaced the rings, and still there's a problem. we've now reached 26K miles. No new fixes. we were advised to carry a quart of oil with us. "I don't think so!" If the 2014 is the same as the 2013 you are making a mistake purchasing this car. If they tell you it's normal.. Its Not..
Let Subaru admit and fix this "alleged" issue first, then this will be a great car.

Recently got this car in July 2013. I wasn't thinking of spending the money for a new car but somehow I found one on the lot for 4k off sticker and went for it.

It was a great choice, the car is incredible sturdy, useful, easy to drive, it came with a manual which was important to me. The backseats are much more comfortable than any SUV I have been in, lots of space in the back too. 
First snow of the season hits and I could not be more pleased with how the car handles. The only thing you have to worry about is the cars around you, this thing is just phenomenal in the snow, especially with a manual transmission.
