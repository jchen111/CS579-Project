Love the car, hate how it burns oil and Subaru knows about it but will not stand behind their product. Oil consumption test done by local Subaru Service department shows 1qt oil consumed in 1,529 miles on our 2014 Outback with 9,253 miles on the odometer. Local Service Department says they did not do the test right, but I looked at the dipstick myself before we took it in. 1qt low at 1,520 miles. Oil consumption test says 1/3qt in 1,200 is out of specification, contacting SOA got us an answer of; go back to the dealer. Really? Stand behind your product Subaru. Read the lawsuit against you and you will see there is no reason for me to go back to my dealer.

This Outback is my first Subaru, and sadly, it will probably be my last.
I had high expectations for this car considering the excellent reviews from prior models, but now that I've got 40,000 miles on it, I'm not impressed.
It burns 1 quart of oil every 1000-1200 miles, which Subaru says is normal.
There is a constant vibration at hwy speeds that is NOT tire related. There are large gaps in the body panels, and the hatch doesn't even line up...indicating poor build quality.
The seat is already starting to deform, and I'm not a big person. There is a constant rattle on deceleration, and the stock stereo speakers are probably the worst I've ever seen.
