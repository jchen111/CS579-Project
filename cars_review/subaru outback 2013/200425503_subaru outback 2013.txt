This is my sixth Subaru and it is the most refined Subaru I have owned. The interior is very comfortable and after 4000 miles it does most things well, except driving on the highway. The first extended highway drive I encountered I found that the car wandered and I had to do constant corrections to keep it in the lane. It felt like driving on an extremely windy day but it was dead calm. I contacted the dealer and they advised to bring it in as it probably needed an alignment. When I brought it in someone test drove the car and said it was normal. That day I had a friend drive it who noticed it immediately. My wife won't drive it on the highway and Subaru claims this is normal? Buyer Beware!!

Very good to excellent in all aspects, except for the integrated roof rack. The crossbars do not work with many older Thule products (bike carriers, ski racks, kayak carriers), and they do not extend beyond the width of the roof line. For those outdoor enthusiasts who need to carry multiple items, we need to attach standard Thule crossbars. However, the design of the roof limits the front to back bar distance to 25 inches. This makes for a less stable kayak carrier or rooftop box. I am told that Subaru and Yakima have an agreed upon specific adapter for Yakima crossbars. Subaru needs to do the same with Thule, given the large number of Thule enthusiasts.

Traded in our 10 Legacy that we loved for the ground clearance of the Outback, ordered June of 12 and received in July so a year now and have loved everything about it. Ride was sportier in the Legacy and it probably isnt of Audi or BMW quality..(Maybe better) We have taken several long trips very comfortably and on the Hwy can easily get the 30mpg promised avg hand calc over the last year is shy of 26 and we do in town driving. 2.5i strong enough for anyone unless you just love having the 6 cyl, live @ 4000ft and go down the hill all the time. Works great in the snow. Nav is good not great, large back up camera. Recommend to anyone, Great Value.

Like several others...I'm a little disappointed in the mileage.
My new Outback gets about 26 on my daily 27 mile (each way) commute.
While that matches the "overall" mileage rating...I was hoping for better.
My last vehicle, a Jeep Patriot, actually got it's rated 27 mpg on that same commute.
But the Outback is certainly more comfortable to drive.
The steering takes a little getting used to...but only because it's very tight and responsive.
Before buying, I test drove everything in its class and it's only real competition was the Forrester.

Only 750 miles. So far, everything I expected. Love the white with corresponding black, headlight design, and overall look. Interior design and layout very good.
Wish list: auto headlight delay when shutting off; make memory seats and adaptive cruise separate options; lift gate window open separate from lift gate. Knew these weren't there before purchase, but would be good features/options for future.
Voice command navigation hard to use.

There are two issues with the vehicle that really take away from the enjoyment of driving the car and make me regret purchasing it in the first place.
The first issue is that the Harmon/Kardon "upgraded" audio system presents a noticeable hiss when doing certain functions with the audio/nav unit.
When I am programming my nav unit each time I press a button I hear a hiss that gets louder, than softer.
Same with when I am talking to someone using the bluetooth phone.
Each time the person talks a noticeable hiss gets a bit louder than goes quiet again.
The other issue is a very noticeable "clunk" noise when releasing the brake pedal when at a complete stop.
Makes the care feel cheap.

I have driven full size American 4x4 pick-ups for the last 25 years.
Divorce and gas prices caused me to down size.
I love this car, it gets great gas mileage and can still get me to my hunting cabin in Maine.
I must say that 30 MPG is not quite accurate.
I am averaging 25.5 with mixed driving.
I can get 28 on highway at 70 mph.
The car is comfortable, nice riding and capable.
I would buy another Subaru without question and I recommend one to anyone who needs a fun car thats good in snow and a little off roading.

We recently passed 10,000 miles on our 2.5 Outback Limited.
I'll state right up front that so far we love this car.
We have not had any realibility concerns and it has performed very well.
The new engine and 2nd gen CVT work well together, and we find the drivetrain to be very responsive.
We have been averaging 26/27 mpgs in mixed driving.
Driveability and traction in bad weather has been great!
On the downside, the mpgs have gone down since winter has arrived, although we have been using the remote start a lot. The premium radio is good but not on par with offerings from other mfrs, and the SAT radio seems to cut out a lot.
Overall though it is proving out to be a good purchase.

Outback 2.5i Limited rides and handles fine. Overall utility of the car is good. And the interior satisfies in most respects, including nav and sound. But the car often feels as if it is fighting headwinds, even on gradual descents. I attribute this to the CVT, or perhaps a lack of power. There is also a noticeable vibration which travels up the seatback at idle. But the biggest disappointment by far: I am averaging 21-22 MPG with this car (60/40 city/hwy, non-aggressive driver). EPA combined is listed at 26, so I am not happy.

I looked at cars for over a year and the Outback was the only vehicle that met all of my criteria. I test drove my 2013 and wanted to purchase it right away. I was aware that Subaru changed the engine and added a timing chain instead of a timing belt but, didnt know that the CVT was also revised. Reading old reviews I can tell you that the 2013 is "torquier" and responsive when you take off from a dead stop. Also I am averaging 28.5 MPG combined highway/city. Over 32 MPG on long trips. I have 3500 miles on the car already. The navigation IS a bit clumsy as I have seen other people comment on BUT, it is very accurate and believe me I am no Louis or, Clark :).
