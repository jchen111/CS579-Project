I traded in my 2011 328xi BMW for the SL Rogue as I needed more space and better mileage.
People get surprised when they sit in the back, feeling spacious and comfortable. I am getting 23-27 miles per gallon in the city and 31-33 in the highway and the average is about 27, outstanding! A bit slow at the beginning, but it was expected due to hp and 4 cyl; however, if you need that extra bust, press the "sport" button and you will be a bit surprised how much faster this baby can go.
Great ride a and sound system better that my BMW.
In my opinion, no other Crossover/SUV will give you a better bang for your buck, not to mention is good looking and stands out from the crowd!

 Our 2014 Rogue SL's digital ac control won't turn on when the vehicle is started we purchased it in June and since then it has been at the dealership 27 out of the first 40 days since delivery. Nissan has thus far been unable to fix the issue. Do not buy a 2014 Rogue! We are hard working people that were trying to provide a quality vehicle for our family and so far this experience has been a nightmare! The regional manufacturing rep for Nissan is involved, but they are still dragging their feet.
Nissan of Chesapeake can not repair the Rogue while we are sitting back making payments and driving something much smaller and not comparable to our purchase. Again DO NOT PURCHASE A NISSAN!!!

Traded out of a very troublesome 2013 Escape into the Rogue SL with Nav.
 Comapring to the Escape, the Nissan has a bit more hard plastic, but the overall feel of 'quality' is better.
The ride is noticeably smoother, even with much higher than suggested tire pressure.
Also much quieter, both as to wind noise and tire/road noise. The CVT transmission seems a bit sluggish when shifting, but is very smooth.
Fuel economy so far is steady at 26mpg combined, and a bit over 29 at 70mph... which is very good for a brand new vehicle.
