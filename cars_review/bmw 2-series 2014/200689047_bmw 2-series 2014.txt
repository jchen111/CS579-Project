Overall an outstanding coupe, significant improvement over the 1 series.
The engine is impressive with no noticeable turbo lag, steering has been lightened up in the comfort mode but does get heavier in the sport mode.
Handling in the corners is on rails, wish I was back in Germany driving on the autobahn!
Interior design is well thought out, controls are easy to use and the temp display is visible with polarized sunglasses now (a problem in my 330xi).
Trunk space is good and with the seats down there's lots of room to carry cargo.
Back seats are OK for a short drive but I rarely have anyone in the back seats so no big deal for me.
Got the mineral grey color/black interior looks great!
