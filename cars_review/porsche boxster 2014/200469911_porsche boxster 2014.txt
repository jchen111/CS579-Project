After driving a 2003 Boxster for the past seven years, I was ready for a change.
Something larger and more practical was in order.
Not another two seat roadster - I was moving on.


Then, out of curiosity, I test drove the new Porsche Boxster.
I was instantly hooked. It is hard to describe just how much better the new version of the Boxster is versus its predecessor.
It is better in every way - substantially better.
The former was fun and competent.
Enoyable.
The new Boxster looks, sounds and drives like a supercar.
It is incredible.

If you really need/want a practical car, avoid this car like the plague - lest you be seduced too.
