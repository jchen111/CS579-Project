RE: Cap Less Fuel System: Beware -My son had a nozzle at the gas station get stuck in the fill port. The mechanic there had to take the whole thing apart and still could not get the nozzle out! Apparently Ford is aware of this and has a bulletin out. There are certain nozzles you can and can't use. Ridiculous. Had to finally get a pick in there with some twisting got the nozzle out.

My 22 year old son and I needed a car after a lady wrecked his new scooter.
We went after the least expensive safe new car we could find and the Ford Fiesta came thru big time.
We can't believe what a great value this fun to drive car is.
No complaints, just Love!
