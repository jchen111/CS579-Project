Okay will be putting nearly 500 miles per week on this car. I will wait while you do the math. I did go for the 100k 7 yr. warranty. I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't have that option.
I have learned that over 80% of the population cannot drive a stick. Well that is bad for them and awesome for me. If you know how to drive one. Oh you will fall in love with the zippy feisty fiesta!
have yet to meet a car that wasn't fun with an auto trans. In fact most cars I test drove didn't have a manny available. I do a lot of traveling and commuting. My morning coffee smells better and my ride is awesome. Its a fun commuter car that will brighten your mornings! Don't pass this one up!!
