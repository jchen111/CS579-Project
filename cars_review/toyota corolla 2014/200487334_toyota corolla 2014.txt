So far, this has been a great vehicle!
I've only had it a week but noticed gas mileage has actually been better than what's advertised on the sticker. I am averaging 30mpg combined and 40mpg average on the interstate and sometimes it goes even higher according to the gauge. I haven't seen anything below 30mpg, even in stop and go. Note that ,on the gauge, the number is the average mpg, where as, the slider is the actual mpg. This is my first Toyota lease experience and the whole thing has been great. I opted for the sport because it seemed the best value, vs options and it comes in the gray color I like. I think this is going to be the start of a great relationship.

I'm the last person one would expect to be seen in a Corolla, but I still got one!
I shopped around and compare the Civic, the Mazda 2, 3, the Focus, the Elantra GT and the Accent.
My previous two cars were fast turbo cars with plenty of power and handling. 
The Mazda 3 is definitely faster than the Corolla, and handles better.
So why did I pick the Corolla instead of the Mazda?
It felt like the most luxurious car of the bunch, with a decent ride, at a price others couldn't beat.
I have everything I always wanted in one package with the "S", no need for additional 1200 Moonroof and other expensive options.
The Mazda comes close, but it was more expensive.
