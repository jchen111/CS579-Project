As mentioned by someone else, this car generally get so-so reviews because it doesn't comply with auto-journalist enthusiasts vision of a great car : no turbo, no DI, no IRS, no 4 disc brakes... They miss the point. 
This "old technology" package accomplish equivalent or more than some of the fancier competition : comfortable and composed ride and decent power with a hard to beat fuel economy (I'm at 38 mpg average (50/50) over 10,000 miles, despite the break-in period and harsh winter.
Lots of plastic Inside but well put together with a somewhat elegant design. Real DEL headlights (not decorative) are great. Steering wheel /voice, Bluetooth, USB, back-up camera. Any equivalent for 20K $ ?

I purchased this car for my wife in Evergreen exterior with amber seats.
It looks weird in pictures but really good in person.
The current Honda civics are ugly and the interior materials are subpar.
Toyota really hit a home run with this car.
Exterior is sleek and handsome, while the interior is well thought out and handsome.
There are still actual knobs for volume and AC.
AC blows cold.
Power is really good, especially for climbing hills.
The CVT is really good and smooth, I don't hear any whine at all.
I find the LE ECO is the best value, since it already has a backup camera and hiighest MPG.
Don't need any fancy wheels to reduce my MPG.
Car is relatively quiet.

Someone told a big lie about the gas mileage on this car - it is terrible. I had a 91 volvo and was paying the exact amount for gas without the car payment. If gas mileage is a concern... go with a hybrid... this is absolutely not your car
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's been about two months now since I purchased my 2014 Corolla LE ECO Plus. It's a nice budget car that has a stylish design. It is great on fuel economy for non-hybrid car. I spend about $10-$15 less compared to my previous car per month in gas.

Although there is one issue that has me scratching my head. About a week ago, the engine did a "barf" to sort of speak. The engine somewhat stalled when I tried to start it. Once I got it started, put it in gear and then it would stall again. I brought the car to the dealer and they said there was a computer software failure that caused the problem. Really?!?
