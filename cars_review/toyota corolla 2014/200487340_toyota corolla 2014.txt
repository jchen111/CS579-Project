Bought both the 2014 Civic and the 2014 Corolla about the same time. The Corolla interior was
re-designed and that was the main reason I
chose it.
Inside it feels much more solid than the Civic,
both have the same Eco and leather trim with
power seats.
Mileage is at least 3 more mpg than the Civic,
at highway it gets an easy 40 mpg with the A/C
on.
Toyota has a two year free service included which Honda lacks, big plus. Also its free traffic information screen is better than the Civic,
including traffic accidents on the traveled road along with the weather.
Around town it gets 34mpg with no problem, the Civic 31.
