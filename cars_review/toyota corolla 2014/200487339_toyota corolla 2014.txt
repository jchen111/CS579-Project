I bought this car after looking at many options from: KIA, Hyundai, and Honda. I decided to go with the Corolla Eco Plus, because it seemed like the most bang for my buck. And I was right, first of all the new Corolla design is very sleek and roomy inside.

Furthermore, I got this car of the MPG which is an estimated 42 MPG highway.
Which I was a little skeptical about to be honest. Since that seems to be the problem many other cars and the estimated MPG.

 However, this is not the case with the Corolla Eco. I recently went on a 60 Mile pure highway trip, and I was extremely impressed with the MPG which was 50 MPG! I couldn't believe it.
I hope this stays true for the life of the
car.

I have had the 2014 Corolla LE plus for less than two weeks. During that time, anytime the temperature drops below 20 degrees F, the front windows won't come down (open) I took it in for service, but everyone in the dealership I spoke with swore up and down that the same happens in cold weather to their front windows, too. I lodged a complaint with Toyota corporate, but they say they can't do anything about it now.
