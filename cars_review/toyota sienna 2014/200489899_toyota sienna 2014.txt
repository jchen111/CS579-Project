Perhaps the worst Toyota among 7 that I owned in the past 14 years. Had a pleasure to own  two 4Runners, 2 GX470 and 1 GX460, 1 Highlander. This Sienna is wrong in almost every department but biggest is by far rattle and squeaks from cheapest plastic panels that 2014 Sienna has. Impossible to to mitigate those issues. 3rd row seats rattle loudly even after anti-rattle kit was installed. Inside the van it is obnoxiously loud, all road noise comes in at highway speeds that you need to crank radio just to hear it. Certainly, not good for long trips, we bought it to take on the cross-country trips but what a mistake it was.
