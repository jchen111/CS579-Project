I've been a Honda guy since I was 17.
I wanted a sedan mated to a 6 speed manual because I enjoy driving and the manual makes the experience much more fun!
It is next to impossible to find an Accord with a manual transmission, so...I landed at VW. This is my first dive into a German car and I couldn't be happier with my 6-speed CC Sport.
It is smooth, quiet,comfortable, sporty, great looking (many say it looks like a Benz CLS) and fun to drive.
I've had it for over 5 months and I still look forward to driving it everyday.
I'm in sales and spend a lot of time in my car and it's wonderful to drive.
I drive over mountain passes, simply put it in 6th gear and it just goes.
Well engineered
