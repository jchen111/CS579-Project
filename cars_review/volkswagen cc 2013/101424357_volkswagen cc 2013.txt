I think I have a firm grasp on this car now... Great computer features, headlights are awesome, bluetooth and other techs are top notch. I have found SOME build quality problems: loose door bolt, some auto start issues on occasion and window squeaking when the weather stripping is met my the glass. Overall a great car with great mpg and gadgets. 
Be warned however, this is not a "drivers" car. It is comfortable and smooth but it IS NOT a fast car and it does not corner really well either. Finally, because of the soft suspension and low ride height, take it easy over speed tables... you CAN bottom out. 
Would I recommend this car to anyone, YES! Does it have SOME faults... yes.

I recently purchased the 2013 after owning the '12 despite my reservations due to esthetics, namely the grill because I think the grill screams 'Made in the USA' (Offense unintentional).
The car seems louder and deliberate during acceleration and idling.
I really enjoy looking at the 1" diameter difference in performance tires, but dislike the ride now.
On the up side, my visibility at night has much improved with the LEDs.
This seems to be the only time at which I am content with this decision.
