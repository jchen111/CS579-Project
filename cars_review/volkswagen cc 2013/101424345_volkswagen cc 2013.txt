I drive this car in rural and interstate highway conditions.
Unlike some, I find it to be very powerful, and I think it handles very well though it is not a racing car.
And it also provides excellent fuel economy.
I would say that, after 21,000 miles, it has met all of my expectations while leaving me with one major disappointment: The CC burns oil.
This is a quote from the owner's manual: "Depending on the way the vehicle is driven and the operating conditions, oil consumption can be up to 1 quart per 1,200 miles (0.5Â•fiter per 1,000 km). Consumption may be higher for new vehicles during the first 3,000 mile.s (5,000 km)."
I think this is absolutely no standard at all.
