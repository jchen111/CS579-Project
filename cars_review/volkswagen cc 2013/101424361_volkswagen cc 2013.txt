I just took delivery of my new 2013 CC LUX in black oak brown with the two-tone tan/black interior and I LOVE this car! It is elegant, sporty, plenty quick enough for me and beautifully designed both inside and out. I still am astonished at how much people have complained about the grille redesign of the CC. It is relatively minor, and the car still reeks of German style and engineering (and, by the way, unlike the Passat and Jetta, is still made in Germany). It has the tight, "hard" Teutonic ride of a German car, but is also comfortable. The electronics, controls in the cabin and knobs and buttons all feel high quality and operate smoothly. The overall feeling of the car is quite Audi-like.

I have had my CC for 2 months and must say I love it.
No issues so far to report.
The only complaint I have is that I feel it should come standard with the VW Fender sound system.
The stock system in mine is not the greatest - can be very tinny sounding with some distortion.
Satellite radio cuts out with any overhead impediment (like being under a roof at the bank teller).
Other than that, things have been great.
Love the styling inside and out.
Engine is peppy and powerful enough for me and I've gotten pretty good mileage - roughly 32 mpg average according to the trip computer.
Interested to see how it will do in winter driving.
