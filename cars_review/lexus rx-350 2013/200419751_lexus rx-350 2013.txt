Bought this RX350 in March 2013 and have 30,200 miles on. We got every option except radar and front window navigation.

It is what we thought a Lexus should be.
If there is a next time would go with Hybrid because of intown mileage.

Am not convinced the 19" wheels are right for the car and would have liked to have had 18".
The odometer shows consistently higher speed by about 3 or 4 miles than actual speed as measured by radar signs and when running a side-by-side with other 2013 SUV's.

I've been driving Lexus' LS's for over 20 from 400- 460's. When purchasing my new RX350, no one at Lexus informed me that there was a flaw when engaging the cruise control. When you engage the cruise control the display located on the dashboard above the speedometer goes blank other than the word SET, and does not re-appear unless: 1.You hit the brakes, which disengages the cruise control, or 2.You manually re-engage the display with the thumb control on the steering wheel, or 3.You turn the cruise control off. None of the LS's, IS's, ES's or GS's do this so it is an obvious flaw in manufacture. Lexus says you have to live with it. I wouldn't have bought it had I known up front.

Bought a brand new RX 350 fully loaded on October 14, 2013. This is my first Lexus and have been a previous owner of several Toyotas like Camry, Venza and Yaris. While I like the vehicle in general I posted some of the improvements so that prospective buyers can be aware of some of the shortcomings and may want to wait for the completely redesigned 2015 model which should be out some time late in Fall 14.

Have our 2013 Lexus RX 350 for about a month. It has all the bells and whistles. Over all, I am happy with the car so far. However, I do not agree with those who say it has a smooth ride. This car has a very stiff ride, and I can feel every bump on the road. Unless I am driving on a very smooth surface, the ride is bumpy. Also, I find the seats rather tough. We have a 2011 Honda Accord which is smoother than this car! Maybe, it has something to do with the bloody Dunlop tires.
Can not tell about reliability yet.

Beautiful design, love it!, very nice ride, a little pricey but worthy, Only problem AM radio stations have static, took car to the dealer in West Kendall in Miami and was told they don't have a fix to the problem yet, Lexus is working on it, and that as soon as a fix is available they will contact me. Service and General Manager said this is a problem with the RX and the ES. Service dept tried to give me a 'closed' ticket and I demanded that the problem of the radio needed to be clearly stated on the service ticket and it should be treated as an 'open' ticket, they promise to follow up and contact me once a fix was available. I wrote to Lexus headquarter and stated the problem

2013 Lexus RX350:
-Inconvenient driver storage areas: 
The only convenient area is the door pocket (which conveniently expands).
-The shelf under the center console is very difficult to access.
-the Lexus Remote Touch System is impressive but not efficient to use.
-GPS system - salesman said the database can be updated. He didnt say itll cost $169.
-My biggest disappointment - CD player!
Window Sticker- listed under Standard Equipment, 6-disc CD Changer.
On right, under accessories:
single CD/DVD player
(deceiving)
Since it was listed under Standard Equipment, I thought I was paying for a 6-disc CD Changer!
I didnt catch this sleight of hand switch.

Let me start my review by saying that I loved my 2010 RX 350.
Why haven't I read that the 2013 RX 350 has a much stiffer suspension and harder seats.
Even my husband who doesn't care about comfort in car has noticed that the seats are hard. I leased the 2013 RX 350 non sport model.
NON Sport and it has a very harsh bouncy ride.
 I so wish that I had not turned in my 2010 for this model.
