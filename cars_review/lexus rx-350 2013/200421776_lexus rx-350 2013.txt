This car is not bad even I preffered to lease a BMW X5 35d, X5 is bigger with more technologies and brand name, but I decided to lease the Lexus for my wife as well as a good deal. After couple weeks drive, it is not so disappointed, everthing works fine and obviously much better than the RX300 I leased on 2000. If you don't care the brand name and some strange designs, even F Sport comes with better appearances, it is an option for luxury SUV's at this class.
