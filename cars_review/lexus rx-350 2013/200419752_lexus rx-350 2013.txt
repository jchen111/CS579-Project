From day one I knew I bought the vehicle I always wanted. Everything is perfect with this vehicle. Looks,Ride,Comfort,quiet,refined and safe. Also lots of storage and plenty of room to haul just about anything when the back seats are folded down. Just fantastic. Plus-- the re-sale value is there when your ready for another quality vehicle from Lexus.

Yes this RX350 is everything and more than I expected. What a vehicle. I truly can not think of anything that should be changed or improved upon. We just love everything about it. Dreams do come true-----

Just picked up our new 2013 RX350 Monday. Only one word describes this auto. WOW. It is everything we expected and more. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just purchased my first Lexus
a few days ago and it was the best decision that I had ever made.
 The vehicle is so comfortable and well built.
 The quality of the vehicle is absolutely outstanding.

The interior is very well made and I really do not want to finish my driving!
 This vehicle has all the features.

The vehicle is so quiet
and I just love it. 

I am not sure about realiability yet, but my Toyota experience ( I used to own a
2002 Toyota Highlander) has been great.

This will not be my last Lexus. I am sure that I will purchase another one in the near future.

First, let me be clear that I have nothing against the Lexus brand, they make great cars and my family love their cars.

That past experience has holded me back till now to write anything negative about Lexus but here is what has happened.

I replaced my two year old 3 series bmw with a 2013 Lexus RX350. Loved the vehicle, still do BUT I started hearing this very hard to notice (for anyone not sitting on the driver' seat) noise, it was coming from the left drive side seat belt column. On long trips and even shorter ones, a tiny bump or little wind will make the noise to be more constant and annoying. Long story short, I have taken the vehicle to Lexus service three times as of June 1st..
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2013 has made subtle changes from the '12 model but the changes are noticeable.
The front of the car looks great now and unfortunately those with the 2012 model look outdated and antiquated next to it.
The interior is clean, modern, and sleek without goddy ornamentation and flare.
It's a luxurious car without looking ostentatious.
The ride is smooth and you can't hear the wind outside going 70mph down the highway.
The technology is a win, I've driven Mercedes (2011), Jeep (2012), BMW (2006), and so on... none of them come close to the Lexus for tech.
Pandora is a huge plus.

Test-drove the audi q5, mercedes glk and rx350. I decided to got with the rx350 because it had an amazing feel to it, very luxurious. I had a rav4 (v4) prior to this, I used to average 10.8L/100km. In the rx I average 11.5L/100km, wow. I also felt like it was roomier than the q5 and glk. It cost me more than the german competitors and it was worth it. I really enjoy driving this car and if Lexus keeps their standards high I can see my self purchasing another one in 4 years. I got mine in Starlight Black Mica (the colour glows in the sun) with the saddle tan interior. I am loving this combination. The LEDs and new corporate grill make this car look much more sportier than before.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lexus Emform suite is poorly designed and never should have been released. There are numerous bugs, the most annoying being the failure of Pandora to operate. Dealer had no answers or fix saying Lexus is working on the issues. It's fairly obvious that product/software testing was not adequate prior to releasing. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I traded for a 2013 as I really like the exterior styling changes and the new claret mica color.
It reminds me of looking through a sparkling glass of California pinot noir.
The interior is still as comfortable as the 2010-2012 versions, and the cabin is still as quiet.
No change to the powertrain means the same peppy performance and smooth shifting A/T.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After turning in our 2010 lease a bit early, I bought a new 2013 RX 350.
What a difference.
The auto rides like on a cloud yet handles impeccably.
There have been a number of refinements in the user interface which were all welcomed.
Now there a buttons for everything as well as control from the redisigned and easier to use mouse.
I like the apps which are useful especially Pandora.
The mileage has been good as I am getting up to 24 mpg on the highway.
Averaging about 21 mpg so far.
All in all a great car and happy we bought another Lexus.
