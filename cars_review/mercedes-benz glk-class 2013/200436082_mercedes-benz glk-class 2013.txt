I love this car and it comforts and how it drives and the amenities. But BEWARE this car has problems.
These cars have issues and MBUSA nor the dealerships will not stand or help you in the least bit. I have begged until I am blue in the face
The check engine light illuminates after filling up with gas and in numerous instances because of a "throttle valve problem that no dealership in Florida nor Georgia have been able to replicate causes the car to go "limp" meaning you can't

Everyone knows that.
Buy a Honda and if you think it is too small then you didn't pay attention when you test drove it, if you did.
