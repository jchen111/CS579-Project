I own the most basic model of the versa. For the price, the value is pretty good. The car is very roomy, more than what you would expect. Looks are also ok. Driving, it has enough power to get you places but take it easy on the road because it does not grip well and gets tossed around by the wind like a leaf. Reliability has been terrible for my car, I would be broke if it wasn't for the warranty. In one year and less than 18,000 miles, it's had 4 significant mechanical problems already. Loose muffler shield, damaged sway bar links, malfunctioning valve, and foggy headlight.

I was in the market for an affordable car I could pay for with cash and avoid payments. I looked at Hyundai, Ford, Kia and Nissan. I went with the the Versa Sedan with the manual transmission. I plopped down $14,128 out the door with an extended warrenty. (5 year bumper to bumper) It drives great and is quite nimble. The back seat is huge as is the trunk. Milage is in the high 30's. It is a nice family car. It's more than an "economy car". It's solid. I'm happy. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32.5 mpg with mixed driving of hwy & street.
I got 5spd and loving it.
took the them 2months to order it but it was worth the wait.
No power windows, locks, or mirrors but everything else is standard.
Great car for work since I drive 52miles to work one way....also, it's a timing chain so this car will last forever with less maintenance.
