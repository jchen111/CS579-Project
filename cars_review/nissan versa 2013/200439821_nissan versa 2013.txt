The day I received a $3500 estimate to fix my 6 year old Prius was the day I TRADED IN that 6 year old Prius & Got my BRAN NEW Versa ...
Even Up,
No Regrets :)

A year later I now have 45,000 miles on my Versa. Ive delivered pizza with it in the ice & snow storms of Northern Wisconsin to the heat indexes & humidity of South Mississippi. I get 36mpg Delivering in town with the air ON and 44mpg on freeways.

I only use a full synthetic 0w-20 motor oil and keep the car serviced. Ive Driven this car Long, & Very, Very, Hard - and it has never faltered me or slowed me down.
It never ceases to Amaze me how much power and room I can have under 15 Grand all-the-while averaging 40 mpg.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps the most uncomfortable car I've driven. 

To be fair, this is a long-term rental, so I don't have an emotional attachment. With that said, I find the Versa a hard car to love. 

A slight breeze can be dangerous. Driving in windy Texas is especially challenging as it requires constant corrections to keep it pointed between the stripes. You don't drive the Versa, the Versa drives you. Sometimes I fell it has a death wish.

It's loud and uncomfortable on long trips. MPG's are good. A solid 37.5 MPG on long 75 MPH highway stretches, but a 10 gal tank requires frequent stopping.

It's not for tall people. No telescoping steering wheel and the sit up straight seats wear you out.
