Bought a Nissan Versa SL. The cabin has more than enough space for four passengers, as well as providing comfortable seats. The interior is completely made of hard plastic, make sure your foot doesn't hit the door on the way out. The 1.6L engine is adequate around town and really does sip gas. On the highway, there's tons of wind noise, and the CVT, while providing smooth acceleration and excellent fuel economy, can be heard at any speed. Don't be fooled by the 109 hp rating, the car has more than enough get up and go. Excellent visibility all-around, smooth ride. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Has no storage for driver to access items like center console. Drove me crazy so I bought one off ebay for $45 works and matched perfect. No place for glasses either. Cup holders are placed odly to far up and the others to far back. No inside trunk release. Complained to dealer right corner panel loose and no place to hang gas cap they told me all versas are like that? Very squirley on fwy in wind and rides a little rougher than I would expect for a new car . but I do like the car even with these negatives see favorite features.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although I like the comfort and style, the MPG rating is way over rated.

Driving it on the highway and city mixed I get 26 MPG. 

I reset the average counter, drove 75 miles on the highway with cruise control @ 60 mph and still under 30 MPG.
