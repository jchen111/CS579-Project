I was driving at 30 miles an hour and my new versa with 7000 miles. All of the sudden my computer went off and i could not use the brakes. I was lucky to avoid an accident. I said I do not feel safe in this car to Nissan and Lokey of Clearwater and they said they will just repair the car. At first they didn't know what was wrong and then they fixed the ABS chip and recalibrated the computer. I drove the car and one week later I was going 50 mph and the brakes were all the way in and they were barely stopping. Luckily I avoided the accident. I called Nissan and they ignored me and said that there is nothing they can do for me. So now they fixed the master cylinder. I feel very unsafe driving.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Comfortable.
2) Practical. 
3) Good gas Mileage. 
4) Nice Drive.
5) Not a lot of power.
But, enough power.

"Bought an SV model and have close to 200 miles in.
It's terrific!! Just what I was looking for.
It get's me from point A to point B without spending lot's of hard earned cash. If you are looking for luxury then recommend the Acura line, or possibly Honda, but for normal commute, it's perfect. Getting about 36 mpg average and loving it. The CVT doesn't bother me so far (based on reviews) - actually it is smoother than most normal tranny cars I've driven. I did own a Datsun B-210 (manual) and an Altima so I do like Nissan.
LOTS of room.
My opinion - this car's ingenuity sticks out at me and I'm definitely loving it. Take one out for a test drive and you'll see. I did, and now I own one!!"
