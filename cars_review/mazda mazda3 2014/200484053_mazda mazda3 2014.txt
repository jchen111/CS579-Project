I am in love with this car. I have owned a 2004 Mazda 3 sedan, a 2008 Mazda3 GT sport (hatch), and a 2013 Mazda cx-5. I traded my CX-5 in for the 2014 Mazda 3 and do not regret it at all. The car handles like a dream, hugs the road and corners perfectly. The interior is simple and modern, and the exterior is striking. I am getting 6.7L/100 (or 43 MPG) with combined city/highway, which is more than I expected to get. If you are looking for an affordable car that is fun to drive, gets great fuel mileage and is reliable, this is it. I have the GS (middle model) with sunroof package, and comfort package. I
also had custom white leather interior installed.

We've always liked Mazda's, this was our fourth, a 2014 mazda 3 Touring sedan,
it could have been so good,
but the front interior space felt cramped and a bit difficult to see out of, the rear seats were very difficult to see out of.
The really ugly looking radio looked velcroed to the dash was a constant eye sore.

Not sure if anyone else has been bothered by this but there was always an very annoying clunk sound coming from the suspension going over bumps.

We traded it after four months for another new make :(.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought a 2014 Mazda 3 Touring in May 2014. So far I'm very satisfied with its performance, fuel economy, ride and handling. It's giving 32 mpg and I drive mostly within the city. On highways the car is extremely stable and predictable. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fun to drive. Good on gas mileage. Not quite what it says for combo driving. Get average 30 with mostly hwy.
Took a long trip with no heat/little AC and got 40/41.
 (Using the heat/seat warmers will lower the MPG quite a bit if the "average this drive" mpg's is accurate) Paid quite a bit more for Navigation (which I didn't really want) and heated seats & they still can't fix the tech package even after update.
Majority of time I can't use the touchscreen. And although seats still heat, they are not working like they were at first.
I purchased it in Dec, and so far no problems engine wise. So if this car is reliable long-term, I will still be happy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2014 Mazda 3 is an eye-catching car.
That's enough to get you in the door.
Once you sit down and take it for a spin, you realize there's not much reason to look at the competition.
It's fun to drive, loaded with tech at your discretion, good on gas, and, oh yeah, it's the best looking car in its class.


I purchased the i-touring sedan in Soul Red with the technology package, and I couldn't be happier. With over a thousand miles on it already, I've been averaging a shade over 35mpg overall in mostly highway driving, with a couple more conscientious drives hitting the magic 40mpg mark.

While the price may be a shade higher than others in its class, consider it enjoyment tax.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forget everything you know about compact cars.
I traded in my 2013 Mazda 3 for the just released 2014, and it's a totally different kind of car.
Interior is fitted with high-end materials for the dash and controls, and feels more like a luxury car.
The handling and suspension are both top rate... you can be aggressive with your drive with good steering feel, and the harshness of the prior model has all been eliminated.
The 2.0 engine is fine for day to day driving, but it lags a little when full power is required.
