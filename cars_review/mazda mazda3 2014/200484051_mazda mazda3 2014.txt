Enjoying my new white Mazda3 S Touring Hatchback, so far. Only complaints would be the road & interior noise. MPG below EPA estimates. Ride is a bit stiff but still comfortable. Just about everything else has been above my expectations for the compact class. The engine is quick, quiet & smooth & I really enjoy the extras like the HUD & Blind Spot Monitor. A great purchase overall!

I have been driving 45 mi. per day in an
older Tacoma, so perhaps I am too easily impressed... but this car is amazing.

Exterior looks, check. Just look at one. Interior is wow! for a Mazda, and the seats are very comfortable.

This model is loaded with tech, like the radar blind spot detection, pacing cruise control, impressive and intuitive infotainment system, adaptive headlights that steer, etc.

But driving is what it's all about and it's what this Mazda is all about. It is fast and nimble. Until you hit the Sport mode button, it is really just a very tight and competent little car. The Sport mode unleashes it's inner potential and it just wants to go. I am glad I got the 2.5L!
