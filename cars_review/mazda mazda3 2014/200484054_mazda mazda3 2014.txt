I made up my mind on the Mazda 3 after one test drive. We chose the Pearl White i-Touring manual hatchback with Navigation and Tech Package. The 2.0 engine is strong enough to merge onto freeways. Ride is firm and comfortable. Road noise is on the low side for the compact car segment. Interior finish is nice and pleasant. The clutch and stick shift very smoothly. After a little over 1000 miles, our gas mileage is similar to the EPA rating. Very happy with the purchase.

This car is really fun to dive and it is also nice to look at. After making a compromise with my wife to get a four door hatchback, I assumed that driving excitement would have to be banished. Not so! This car is a blast to toss around in the corners. The seats hold you very well in place and manual transmission is one of the best I have sampled. With all of that said I do wish that some of the money spent on technology whiz-bang was diverted to more sturdy interior materials. The stalks coming off the steering wheel feel like they might break if hit too hard and the silver plastic door handles remind you every time you exit the car that this is no BMW.
