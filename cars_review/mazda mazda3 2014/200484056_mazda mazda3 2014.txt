This is our 2nd Mazda (wife owns 2012 Mazda 5) and we've been very pleased with both vehicles.  Mine is the 2014 Mazda 3 sedan sport edition w/ manual shift.  Am averaging 36 mpg.  Before buying, I test drove a Civic, Corolla, and Cruze.  All seemed to be good vehicles but the Mazda stood out for its handling and appearance.  Leg room and head room are just fine (I'm 6' 2").  Trunk space is larger than I expected.  The engine is quiet as a kitten. My only knocks are the average looking cloth seats (I replaced w/ leather) and road noise on select highways.  But, boy are these cars fun to drive!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have owned this 2014 Mazda 3 for two months, have a little over 1,000 miles on it.
So far, I am very happy with it, although I wish it got closer to the 30 mpg rating.
I looked at Toyotas, Scion FR-S, and checked online on Fords, Chevys, and Nissans.
The Mazda 3 manual is so much more fun to drive than anything else I drove, and it met most of my other criteria.
I had driven a Camry stick for the last 12 years.
The Mazda 3 is a little smaller, but also quicker and way, way more fun.
It has a little more style than the same-old-same-old looks of most sedans.
I am getting 26mpg, wanted more, but I recommend this car!
