Just traded a 2006 Mazda 3 iTouring hatch with the 2.3L engine and 5spd Auto Trans.
I loved that car, but a pothole created irreparable problems in the front suspension.
Decided to go with the 2.0 in my new iTouring, sacrificing quickness in handling and acceleration for
comfort of higher-profile tires and and fuel economy.
I'm not disappointed - this is a very solid car, and quite roomy.
Seats are exceptionally comfortable, and seating position is perfect.
The higher profile tires that come on the 16" wheels are more forgiving in the sea of potholes we have in DC.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've only been driving this Mazda 3 Touring hatchback for a little over a week, so take what I say for what it's worth. However, I am comparing this 2014 to my 2004 Mazda 6 i manual 5 speed which I traded for the current car.

First, let me say I'm loving the looks of this car and enjoy the overall performance. While it's no powerhouse, the 2.0 has enough Zoom-zoom to feel spirited and enjoyable to drive. Unfortunately with the combination of 155 hp and auto transmission, there is a noticeable lack of power compared to my 10 year old Mazda 6. By comparison, I was able to attain at 0-60 time of 8.4 seconds in the 6 but only a disappointing 10.5 seconds in the new Mazda 3.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I went from a BMW 325i to this and do not miss it at all. It turns with no effort and no body roll even taking a turn at 40 mph! I drive about 30 miles a day and I average 32 mpg having a mixed road type (7 miles city, 23 highway) and it takes me about 2 weeks to get to empty. Ever since I got it, I have never spent more than $35 to fill it up on regular where as the BMW cost about $70-$80 on premium. The infotainment does get a little used to but its mostly simple. I have the feature where it can read my text messages while I'm driving (Doesn't show you the actual message for safety reasons) and it works fine with an iPhone 5c.

I just picked it up on Wednesday, September 25th. iTouring hatchback automatic. I traded in a 2008 Mazda3 iSport manual for this. The gas mileage on this car has been incredible. It has been improved by a land slide compared to my '08. Much smoother ride, great interior fit and finish, and the exterior is beautiful. The interior reminds me a little bit of an Audi, and someone told me they almost thought the exterior was Lexus-like. It has already done well on a road trip. Although the 2.0L isn't the beefiest in power, and yes there is some road noise, it is still an economy car, and for its price it can't be beat, so I give everything 5 stars. I highly recommend this car to anyone.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
picked up and drove it home (1000 miles).
 44 and 45 mpg on two stretches (not all flat), 35mpg through high mountains/hills at 65 mph. 

best handling car i've had, feels like rwd.

if you can get the 2.5L model, esp w/ a 6 speed it would be a blast.
i couldn't swing the extra money at the time.
