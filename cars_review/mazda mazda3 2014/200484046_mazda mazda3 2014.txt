I trade in for a new car every 2 years so have lots of comparison. My last car was a BMW Z4 and this car handles just as well but with better interior build quality and runs on Reg unleaded. I'm glad I got the upgraded 3S engine b/c it never feels underpowered, its quite quick. I love all the standard GT features, but didn't opt for the tech package as I don't want my car bossing me around, let alone the added cost. I just completed a 300 mile highway road trip and got 37.8 MPG, driving 70-85mph.
However, MPG for me drops considerably in city driving around Dallas as I average 25-26 in town.
I've had no problems with Mazda Connect or Navigation, everything works flawlessly for me.

Yes this car is that fun to drive while also being frugal. I'm averaging 35mpg combined. The sport mode when left in drive shifts like a dual clutch (it keeps it's torque converter locked all the time) the interior could be at home in a German sedan. It gets looks everywhere. Basically a smaller Mazda 6. Only complaint is the almond leather which stains on the left thigh bolster from jeans. I clean it once a week. Side mirrors are noisy due to wind (they are big!) sometimes the voice recognition for nav doesn't understand a full address. Sunroof is noisy at freeway speeds when open. Can be pricy fully loaded like mine. Close to $30k. But it's a lot of car for $$ refined, sporty & FUN!!!

Replaced my 2010!GTI and I love everything about this car especially Interior, Features, Performance. Awesome to have Sport Mode in this car as well as paddle shifters. Love the Almond Interior.

Tough to review this car in 700 characters, but look at me go wasting them. This is a great car. 
It's faster than I thought it would be. The automatic gearbox is terrific. The sport mode and paddle shifters are awesome. I averaged 38.5 mpg on my drive from the Bay Area to San Diego (mostly on the highway) and I get probably 28 mpg around town, so it's definitely fuel efficient. The interior is great and so is the exterior. Feels very deluxe. Only put 1.5k on it thus far, so I can't speak for reliability or value, but from what I hear Mazda's do alright in those categories.

My brand new 2014 Mazda 3 S Grand Touring Sedan is my 5th Mazda, and by far the best of a good lot from the highly consumer- and critic-rated series released between 2006 and 2013. At this early juncture, so far this model -- entirely re-designed from front to back outside and inside  appears to be every bit as good as claimed by the automotive reviews that have lauded it as best in the compact class. I chose the classy, sporty-looking sedan over the odd-shaped hatchback that I dont feel  and most critics agree  is anywhere near as nice-looking. I LOVE this baby to the point that even after my long daily commute to work from near Annapolis, MD to-and-from downtown Washington, DC, I dont

This car looks, feels and drives a class above others in the compact class, which is good because at the S Grand Touring trim level it's more expensive. It's also more comfortable to ride in than my two previous 3s (2008 and 2010). My buns thank Mazda because the ride is still firm.
