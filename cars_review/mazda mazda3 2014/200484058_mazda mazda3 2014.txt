I've put 10,000 miles on my 2014 Mazda 3 since buying it in March.  It's a comfortable ride (excluding some road noise), well styled, and turns heads.  It has zip / zoom zoom.  

My car is mica black, with the basic sound system since I already had a high end GPS system and couldn't justify the additional cost of the XM / GPS feature.  Even the basic sound system is more than acceptable, with my iPod docked to it. 

I'm getting 35 mpg consistently (mostly highway, some in-town mileage) without going hybrid.  Moving from a Ford SUV to the Mazda 3 took some getting used to, but I've made the transition and I'm a convert.  This car deserves all of the accolades it's receiving.

I'm enjoying driving my 2014 Mazda 3.
It's taken awhile to adjust to the sight lines, which are not nearly as good (due to low ground clearance) as my prior SUV.
The tradeoff is much better gas mileage, though as others have noted, I haven't achieved nearly the mileage I expected (roughly 30 mpg combined).
Ride is much quieter and softer than I expected.
Handles like a nimble sports car.
Stick with the basics, and add on your own aftermarket bells and whistles for a great car under $20K.
