I purchased my 2013 C300 luxury 4matic in November of 2012. The new dash redesign inspired by the E-Class was a big improvement over the old design. The ext and int fit and finish is flawless. Great V6 acceleration. The ride is firm, smooth & quiet. The opt leather seats are firm & comfortable but lack a full range of adjustment for the front seat bottoms. I get 27-30 mpg on the highway. 7 spd trans shifts smoothly. Nav system works well. Blind spot warning feature is excellent. Get the keyless go feature. Glove box is to small.
The blue tooth phone system is very clear to the person being called. The last C-Class to be built in Germany for the US market. A car to keep for a long time.

I've driven the 2013 C300 Luxury for 5000 miles.
It is far better than the older 2011 with the increase in horsepower from 228 to 248 - it really moves now with the 7-speed.
My gas mileage is 21mpg around town and has reached 30 mpg on highway trips (~65 mph).
The exterior is neater and interior comfortable - it is well made and solid.
It has the mBrace system, with Sirius radio, Bluetooth capability, and navigation (which works unexpectedly well).
I accepted a rear camera, that works well but not something I would have normally purchased.
Not too happy with the stop-start ECO feature, but it has worked flawlessly so far (it can be turned off, but must be turned off each trip).
