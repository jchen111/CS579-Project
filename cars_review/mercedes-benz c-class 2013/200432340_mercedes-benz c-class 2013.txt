I have owned BMWs, Jaguars etc and for the first time ever, I now own a Mercedes-Benz (Well call it MB). Although I have owned the car for a few months only, so I far I can safely say no regrets.

All in all, this car is a terrible disappointment and I cannot understand why it gets such great reviews.
