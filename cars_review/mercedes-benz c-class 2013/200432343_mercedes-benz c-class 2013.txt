The good: recent 1600 mile trip to MSY over thanksgiving netted 27.5 mpg overall.
650 mile hwy trips with slight tail wind netted 28 - 30 mpg at 80mph.
Here in STL around town and commuting to work I average 26 mpg.
So not bad for all wheel drive.
 The infotainment system is great, even the cheaper one like I have with the cheap nav.
It's all u will need.
Now for the bad: dash rattles a bit over rough roads.
The sport ride is too stiff (I'm 35). The front seats are terrible... It was hell driving 10 hrs.
I bought it because I wanted a MB but I probably should have gotten something else more comfortable.
It is a great car but just not right for me.
I'll keep 1 yr no more.

I used to love the car until recently, but I now cannot wait to get out of my lease.
It is the perfect size for me, comfortable, easy to navigate, and have everything I need.
However, I clearly got a defect car with a bad ignition system. The car is only 15 month old, and I got it as a brand new.
I have less than 5,300 miles on it.
Everything was fine for the first 1 year.
Then in this April, I drove 30 miles away from my home, and parked on the side street for coffee.
When I came back, I was not able to turn on the engine, and MB Roadside Assistance told me that the key didnÂt recognize my car.
I had to wait for 3 hours to get my car towed.
It took 2 weeks for MB to replace the igni

I just turned in my 2010 E350 Coupe for the C300 Sport 4Matic for weather issues.
While it doesn't have the speed of the E350 (which of course, it is not meant to), it is spry and actually more fun to drive as the car has no blind spots and you can zip in an out of city traffic with ease.
(I am 5' 3" and can see over the roof.)
I love it!!!
Great traction on wet roads and the ECO option and the gas mileage are added benefits.
Kept the same Panoramic Roof and stero system as I had in the E350.
Couldn't be more pleased.
I came from having BMWs and Volvos and Mercedes does it right!!
