The 2013 Diesel S350 is a monster, great powerful and excellent to drive. This is the best car I have ever owned. I just clocked 8631  miles on this baby she is smooth as silk and powerful like a lion. I have owned  4 other MBZ but this is the one to die for. You feel the safety, the handling and a big body benz will never leave you empty handed. The S- Class is fully loaded and more the Interior is well laid out with all controls within easy access. I am averaging over 35 MPG in mixed city and highway driving. 4 Matic works great in all weather. This 350 is truly a a dream to drive and exceptional ride. The Eagle has landed.
