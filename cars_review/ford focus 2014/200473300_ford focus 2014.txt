Check out my Facebook page "Ford Focus Ford Fucos" This car is the worst I've ever owned. The transmission is a joke, the interior melted, the alternator and steering had to be replaced the first year.

I thought this car was going to be too small, but I was very wrong. My husband is 6'4" and he sits comfortably in the driver and passenger seats. The look of the car is stylish, and it handles very well. The manual transmission shifts beautifully. It was a great value, too! Overall, this is a great car. My only complaint is the lack of leg room in the back seat. As a result, this is not our main family car because we have 2 growing kids and another on the way. But for just my husband and I, the car is great.

Test drove 2014 Ford Focus SE 5spd, and was surprised.
Thought it would be too small, that wouldn't like "overly busy" infotainment area of car.
Liked it, bought one.
Good manual transmission.
Heard people didn't like auto trans.
Had driven dual clutch auto-manual vw's, didn't like.
Car is small, need to plan out where to put things, small car ride.
Could use a sixth gear on highway, but fun to drive, feels well-made.
Getting 39mpg+ on ride back and forth to work.
Curvy, hilly back roads.
Do upshift when lighted arrow tells me to do so.
Seems engine would lug, but it doesn't.
Am in fifth gear by 35mph!
Very likable car.
Got great deal.
First black car.
Handsome.

Before you do anything, Google "2014 Ford Focus Transmission Problems." You'll find that thousands of people have had the exact same problem I'm about to recall on here.

On the third day of owning this car the transmission started to slip and shutter. I took it to Ford and they said it was "normal" and sent me on my way. Three weeks later the seals near the clutch started to leak as a result of the shuttering, so they kept my car for 2-3 days so they could replace the seals and clean the clutch. A week later it started slipping and shuttering again. They again will not help me. They will blame you, they will say you drive the car incorrectly.
