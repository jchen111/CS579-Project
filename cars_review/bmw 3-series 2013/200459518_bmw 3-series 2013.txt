 it came down to the audi A4 quattro and this car.
i almost got the audi, save for reliability issues that i had heard about.

at first, i wasn't that warm to the idea of the 320i, being that it was a detuned, stripped-down 328i.
but after a test drive, i was reasonably impressed and decided to go that route.
handling is nimble, car is quick enough, and it handles like a BMW, though softer than my old manual-transmission E46 325ci.

mine is a base model with basically only the moonroof and the power front seats with memory as the only options.
stripped-down and basic, but that's all i needed for a commute that was four miles to/from work each way with no freeways.
