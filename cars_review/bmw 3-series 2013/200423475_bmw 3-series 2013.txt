After owning for several months I think it is time to leave a review. Previously owning a 00 330i and 06 330i I was excited to be getting my first 335i. This car has been a disaster. It left me stranded on the side of the road at 900 miles after overheating, the entire fan system had to be replaced, the passenger side mirror is already broke and does not move, there is a constant vibration and rattle in the steering column, there is dull spots in the paint where it looks like it wasn't clear coated properly. I have already had this car in for repair's twice and without it for two weeks. Compared to my 00 and 06 this one does not even come close to the build quality. At least it looks nice.
