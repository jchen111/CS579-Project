BMW definitely delivered when they redesigned the 3 series. I dig the added length and wheel base.
I have the M-sport edition w/prem and cold wx pkgs to include nav, rear cam, HUD and the Harmon Kardon sound.
I love the Estoril Blue color and stylish M-Sport Wheels.
The sound system is awesome!
Storing music is a snap.
All the features are easy to use and the idrive system makes integrating all of the features a snap!
Only problem so far is a steering issue that whenever I turn the wheel to the extreme right-hand position. There is a clicking noise. I'm not worried since the warranty will cover this and the mechanics will fix it, but it's a bit displeasing to say the least!
