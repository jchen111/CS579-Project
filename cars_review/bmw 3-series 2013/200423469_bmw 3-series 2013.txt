I once thought that BMWs were the ugliest cars on the road.
Then, their recent styling and interior updates, in addition to actually test driving one, got me hooked. Coming from a Taurus I wasn't sure what to expect; but the feeling I get in one word is "solid".
Solid power, handling, materials, tech, comfort: much more of a driver's car than any I have driven.
I drove 100 miles today through snaking rural roads in N. Alabama and S. Tennessee, and I was convinced I made the right choice. The Taurus was cavernous without a center console, and the 328i not so much with the driveshaft in the way, but plenty of room for a 6'2" 300 lb guy who likes space.
I can't wait to go to Greenville...

My last two sedans were Honda Accords (2003, 2010). At age 58, I wanted a "luxury" car while I was still young enough to enjoy it.
Considered Merc C class and Audi A4 but BMW3 test drive clinched it.
Felt just right.
Been two months and over 3500 miles.
Great fun to drive except for the auto stop feature and some very annoying "unexplainables."
This is my first BMW so I probably don't have the right BMW perspective to understand them. But now, when I come across something that doesn't make sense to me,
I figure a BMW engineer must have designed it.
Despite great drive, not sure I'd buy one again.
I hate the surprise engine shut downs when I sometimes forget to turn auto stop off.

I have my car for a week today.
 I custom ordered my car in August.
I ordered a loaded Mineral Gray sports model with red leather interior and black trim.
This car has exceeded my expectations.
The car is striking inside and out.
This car handles and rides better than any car I have ever owned(G35, M35,CLK350 etc...).
In comfort mode it is a small luxury car in Sports or Sports + mode it's a sports car.
The Harmon Kardon sound system is fantastic. The xenon lights are a must.
The transmission with shift paddles is fantastic.
I-drive has been perfected.
Heads up display is the icing.
Averaging 28 MPG in mixed driving and on the highway at 70MPH I am getting 35MPG.
