I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car.

I love this car.
Gas mileage, suspension, and stereo are great.
Bluetooth integration and Pandora integration work perfectly. Suspension and noise cancellation work amazingly well.
Although it looks small, it has plenty of room and has always been big enough. 
Gas mileage has been from 42 to 45 without really trying.
