How to sum this car up - there are no other vehicles in this size that have this many features at this price.
That could be good or bad. 
There are larger vehicles that have this many features at this price (with no gas mileage penalty) and there are plenty of vehicles that are this size that are less expensive and have less features.
So if you could lease a Civic EX-L or a premium package ILX (same monthly payment after you factor in gas and insurance) which would you choose?
If you could buy a loaded Accord or Mazda6 for the same price which would you choose?
Does the badge or dealer experience matter?
All are amazing vehicles - you just need to decide where you want to be.
