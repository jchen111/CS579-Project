I have had my ILX now for over a month and 1,500 miles. It is an excellent car. The complaints about the 2.0L engine being slow are not accurate. I find it to be very peppy and responsive. Plus I drive 64 miles back and forth from work 5 days a week and I have never gotten less than 30 MPG, with an average of 29 MPG city/hwy driving overall. The interior is of excellent quality and the ride is smooth and quiet. The electronics are excellent and the sound system is very good, I use the XM radio all the time and it never drops out. I'm 6 ft tall, 250 lbs and I fit very comfortably in the car. I've even ridden in the back seat and that was comfortable. It looks great and rides great!

3 months of ownership and I'm extremely satisfied with my new ILX.
Very peppy for a small 4cyl. engine. Ride and handling are very impressive.
Excellent use of space on the interior.
I'm coming from a mid-size and don't miss the little extra room I previously had.
I don't want to see many of them on the road, but everyone should give this car a try.

I have owned many cars from Jeeps to Volvos and I keep coming back to Honda products.
I owned a 1996 Acura Integra and I always refer to that as my favorite car.
I owned a 2007 Volvo S40 that was pretty to look at, but drove very choppy.
The 2013 Acura ILX is really smooth and fun to drive.
I have read reviews that the ILX car is a Honda Civic in a tuxedo.
What is wrong with a Honda Civic?
My 2006 Honda Civic EX Coupe drove 10 times better than my Volvo S40 and the new ILX I just purchased drives even smoother and is 10x more luxurious than my Honda was.

I think I have found that perfect blend of performance, luxury and style.
I think I might have found my new favorite car.

I purchased the Acura ILX after owning a Jeep Grand Cherokee for seven years.
I really wanted a new JGC Overland, but decided it made more economic sense to look for a comfortable 60 miles/day commuter that would still give the feeling I was driving a solid entry level luxury car with most of todays tech features.

The ILX has a very well engineered interior that seems well above the luxury level of a Civic or other lower end cars and in line with most other cars up to about 40K.
It is a very pleasant place to relax while commuting a couple of hours a day.

With a low 30's budget I compared against the Audi A3, VW GTI, Lexus 250H, and Suburu Outback and decided this was the best choice.

The Ilx is a great car. I am a Honda/Acura fan which is a big part of why I purchased this car.
You can get more car for the money with Toyota, Honda or Nissan any day, but if you want the Acura badge and build quality you pay the premium. The car handles extremely well, road noise is pretty low and the interior is one of the most comfortable and aesthetically appealing of any car I have owned. The interior isn't large but its done very well. I really enjoy driving this car and it gets its fair share of looks. Don't judge this car by pictures, I went to the dealer to buy a tsx and left with this because when I saw it the body styling really hooked me in. It is definitely not a rebadged civic

This is the second month I am driving this car to work, everyday for 70 miles. 

Certainly don't feel like driving a Civic. Indeed, I owned a 2 doors Accord for 9 years and ILX is way more luxury than Accord, hence I don't know why people said it is just an upscale Civic?! Drive before you judge.... 

Compare to Lexus CT200h and CT200h is not even close to ILX, in luxury and design. ILX designers/engineers are really serious in doing the job and they do it very well.

My dad and I spent months trying to find the perfect car to me.
When I finally sat in this one at the dealership, things just clicked and I knew that this was the one. I love the sleek, exterior design, and the interior has really nice, soft leather. Now I'll never get lost thanks to my navigation, and lovely backup camera!!! I just wish this car had blind spot monitors and had memory seating feature, so I wouldn't have to adjust it everytime someone sits in my car! Also, I don't like how the front and wheel interior is black and the rest of my car is beige! But otherwise, amazing performance and a real money saver when it comes
to gas. Couldn't be happier with it! Love my birthday present
