What a car. Sharp, head turning exterior, got it in streak blue. I catch myself from time to time gawking. Interior is well done. Unique styling. Love the sporty steering wheel and dash layout. Sound system is great! Three speakers on each door?! Heck yeah! Seats are sporty, really support you in tight turns. Plus friends have plenty of room in the back. Trunk has a lot of space with its large door and folding seats. Now for the most important part: Performance! Engine is punchy and responsive. Handling is spot on, I feel in control and confident when taking fast turns. Everything feels like it was well thought out. Not just another cookie cutter car.

This is my first new car and I love it so far. I was overpaying for a 2003 Toyota Celica which I did like but it was old and had a lot of miles, plus I still owed 9k for the car to JDB. I recently traded in the car and got 3k for it then they added the remaining 6k onto the sticker price. I couldn't be happier, I'm not really paying more per month and I have a new car with a warranty! It's basically a Toyota so the thing should run forever and it looks awesome. I've already turned some heads driving it around with the shiny blue paint job.

I just bought my very first Scion Tc (2014) and love it! I never even considered this brand until I saw the car at the lot. And when I was told that Scion is made by Toyota, I was sold. The design is very impressive, a head turner! It's so much fun to drive and I don't like driving that much, but this car gives you back the fun of driving :)

It's no doubt why they call this "The King of The Coupe".
Loved my 2013 so much, I am trading it in to get a 2014!
When I bought my 13' the 14' was just outside my price range.
Now they dropped the 14 to just over the price of 13, making it affordable for me.
