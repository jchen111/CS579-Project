I bought my Scion TC in Apr of this year.  I spent more than 6 months researching this vehicle comparing it to other models.  What I discovered is this is the car for me.  I don't fit the demographics I'm 55.  This car is an amazing vehicle I have owned it for 6 months now and driven it close to 14000 KM's.  I have loved every moment of it.  This car is a smooth drive on long and short trips.  Its fast and agile and a real eye turner I have the metallic Blue with a few add on's I just wish it came with a turbo.  I highly recommend this car lots of room for cargo and passengers.  This is quality built vehicle. Its the first car that I have purchased that doesn't have a ton of little issues.

I bought a 2014 Scion tC manual transmission in blue. It has about 3200 miles on it now. It handles well in rain and snow (just had our 3rd snow storm here in Pennsylvania), It has sporty handling in the twisties due to suspension upgrades for 2014. Looks like no other car, the new wheels are beautiful and hide brake dust. The transmission is very smooth and precise. It is Camry reliable, lighter and quicker than a Camry though. It has plenty of torque which you can feel during takeoff.
The HD stereo is AMAZING! 0-60 time per Car and Driver is 6.9 seconds for the 6sp manual transmission. All this for less than 20k. Plus free service/oil changes! So far I am very pleased.
