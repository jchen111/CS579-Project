We purchased the Rouge new. It was a attractive, solid car, nice to drive. But, first, the paint chips and scratches to easy. Navigation is dangerously inaccurate. We use our Garmin. After dealer changed oil at 3,500 miles, we noticed the engine getting loud on any load being put on it, passing, climbing grade etc.. Drowns out radio. New, mpg was 25.4 consistently. Now 23 and falling. We feel it is because of engine loudness issue. Interior is wonderful. Radio a little disappointing for a Bose. It now has 5,000 miles, and a dealer claims engine noise is normal ? If this car would have remained as we drove it off the lot, we'd love it. Unfortunately, it's in a downhill spiral.

Nissan has decided to short customers buying the 2013 model. The hood insulator (black cover under the hood) is missing and they claim "it is no longer needed". When shopping for a 2013 Rogue, check under the hood and compare to a 2012 or the new 2014 and ask the dealer to explain why this safety feature is missing!
