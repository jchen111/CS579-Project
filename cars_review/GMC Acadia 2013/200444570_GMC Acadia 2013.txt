Only had our Acadia for 3 months rained all day one day while at work, on the way home water was leaking through one of the lights over the third row seats.
It has been in the shop for a week now and STILL not fixed,
spoke with the service manager today, and he is not sure when it will be ready.
I read reviews from past model years that had some leaking problems, and apparently GMC has not fixed them yet.
