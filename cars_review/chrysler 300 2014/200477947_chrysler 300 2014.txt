Just picked up my new 300S today.
Built to order, mine is Jazz Blue with the brand new for Q1 2014 changes - Hyper Black 20" Rims, Blacked out Trim and Ambassador Blue Leather Interior.
I got every option - NAV, Moonroof, Safety Tec, Luxury pkg.
I would love a Hemi, but went with the 3.6 V6 and RWD 8spd - really looking forward to 31+ MPG...)
I have only put 25 miles on it so far, but...
WOW!!!
This car is incredible!!
Looks amazing, drives smoother that any car I have ever been in and has every feature imaginable.
The control screen is awesome.
The heated seats and steering wheel are programmed to come on automatically, and they come on fast and are warm and comfortable
