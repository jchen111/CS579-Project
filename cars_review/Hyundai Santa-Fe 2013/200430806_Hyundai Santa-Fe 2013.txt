It's really my wife's SUV although I've driven it more than she has on three trips.
The first trip was 1200 miles and the second was over 1400 miles with a shorter trip of 800.
The Santa Fe Sport is very tight and its snow white appearance/color makes it very attractive with its the beautiful 17 in. mag style wheels.
Also, its really not that small and the exterior and interior are both well designed.
The Nav is great except for the stupid step of having to agree to safety rules every single time you get in the vehicle.
Like that is going to make you drive more safely or something.
Also the Radio/Stereo is also very good.
Interior coverings and amenities are of high quality.

We purchased the 2013 Sport (5 seater) with the 2.0 turbo, front wheel drive, with the popular and premium packages. The popular package is pretty much standard on all models and the premium adds saddle interior with leather, rear camera, heated front/rear seats, power front seats, etc.
Really didn't want to spend the extra 2 grand or so on the premium option but in the end, we decided the package was worth the money.
Plenty of interior room, initially my wife was worried it was too large, but after driving it, she realized it didn't feel as large as it appeared.
The ride is very solid and comfortable, the turbo gives plenty of oomph, interior is gorgeous, and the quality is excellent.
