The media said that the 2013 Santa Fe LWB was a Veracruz replacement, but it is not so in reality. They basically nerfed many of the standard convenience features on the Veracruz LTD, so I expect that Hyundai is developing a true Veracruz replacement in the near future. 

That said, the 2013 Santa Fe Limited is a refined piece of work in its own right. The chair is very comfortable and adjustable and the technology package makes the car feel connected. I do concede that the design outside and inside are several notches ahead of the Veracruz.

Never owned a Hyundai product, I was smitten by the high style high feature content at a competitive price. My first Santa fe was so riddled with problems Hyundai gave me another. The second has less than half the problems as the first with one common issue that botheres me most, the vehicle randomly shuts off! This has only happend four times in 9 months but it's very serious problem in my opinion. Its very random- the suv loses all power and just stops, it restarts straight away. So far two dealers cannot figure it out. My other two gripes are terrible fuel economy, and interior rattles. Overall I'm much less than happy here. There are other owners who feel the same way I've spoke to.
