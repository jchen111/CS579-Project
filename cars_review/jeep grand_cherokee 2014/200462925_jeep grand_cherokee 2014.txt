I bought my Jeep a year ago and have waited until now to write this review because I wanted to give it a thorough testing. I love the looks both inside and out. I like the features and got a good deal. The build quality just sucks. I'm normally a Toyota person but bought this after being disappointed with the ride of the new 4Runner. I was hesitant about buying a Chrysler due to their poor reputation for quality and it turns out I should've listened to myself.

I am extremely happy with my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo E 4x4.
I have had it for 6 months now, about 8,000 miles.
I am happy to say that I have experienced none of the engine/electronics/transmission issues that some other reviewers have written about.
For me, my JGC has given me the perfect blend of size, performance, and comfort.
I am constantly getting compliments on how it looks (inside and outside), as well as how it rides.
I average about 20 miles per gallon with about half city, half highway driving.
I came from a 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe 4x4 (which was another good vehicle, honestly) - but the extra room and power of the JCG makes me happy I "upgraded."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a 2014 JGC Altitude 4x4 with a May 2014 build date, and it is really great so far.
I am confident that many of the issues reported in the early builds were software related and have been cleared up.

My observed mpg is 17, so that is a little disappointing.
I will admit that I have kind of a heavy foot.
Coming from a string of luxury sport sedans, the lower mpg is offset in part by getting to use regular gas rather than premium (which costs about 12% less at current prices in my area), and dyno oil rather than synthetic.

We leased our Grand Cherokee last June, and so far have not been impressed.
Granted, the car is great looking, comfortable, and the interior is top notch.
That being said, the transmission in this car is a nightmare.
Shifting up and down through gears 1-3 is like riding in car with a 16 year old kid that is learning to drive a stick shift.
It slams and lurches in and out of gears, almost to the point of being embarrassing when we have friends or guests in the car.
I'm glad I leased, and that in two years I'll be able to hand over the keys to the dealer instead of being forced to keep this car long term.
It's already been in twice for multiple warranty issues.

This is my third Jeep but my second lease. This one has fallen short right out the gate. 

I bought my Jeep in February. The issue is when I tried to put the vehicle in reverse or any other gear, it would snap back into park. I would have to turn the vehicle off and on again at which time it would work but my engine light would remain on. 

First they said it was a 'faulty shifter module' and replaced it within 2 hrs. One week later, back in, this time they said 'it is an issue with a transmission part'. Two days in the shop. Two weeks later it's in again...now it has been in for 2 weeks come this Wednesday and they are replacing the entire transmission. Eventually. 



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I absolutely despise driving this vehicle due to the lower shift gear hesitation when accelerating from a stopped position.

We've tried a few computer updates but it didn't help.
 It's a shame b/c the rest of the vehicle is great - very comfortable, smooth ride, great styling, etc.

When I tow the issue is less noticeable b/c its forced to move thru the gears more quickly but then I only get 11.5 mpg.

Whenever people tell me they are thinking about purchasing one, I hand them my keys for a test drive.
I always get them back with a "No way."

I'm skeptical of any review that can overlook this major issue.

I have had my 3.6L Limited for about 5 weeks.
I like the features, and find the cabin very comfortable.
Having been a Grand Cherokee owner for 23 years, I would have preferred to get the basic one, but the navigation was only available with the upgrade.

The only problem I have had is "phantom shifting".
Once in a parking lot, I stopped at a crossroad and when I tried to head thru the intersection, the engine revved up, and I was in neutral.
Another time, I was driving about 35 mph, when the engine suddenly revved up, an I lost forward momentum.
This time it was in second gear.
Big problem if the car slows at highway speed and one is being tailgated!! There will be no brake lights.

8000 miles. Ride and design much better than my 2010 Limited. Averaging 23 to 26 mpg. Comfortable to drive. 8-speed transmission is very clunky. I was so concerned I took it to the dealer and they said no problem. The clunks when coming to a stop remain concerning. Never had such a rough, unrefined transmission in a car, not sure I trust it. V6 is capable and fuel efficient but I do miss my V8. Radio had to be reprogrammed because it would not save Bluetooth phone pairing. There was a service bulletin on that issue.

Jeep has less then 1500 miles on it..
It had a complete transmission failure which left me stranded in the middle of
the road.. Could not shift into neutral it would immediately go back into park.
I was stranded in the middle of the road with traffic speeding by my Jeep.
It was one of the most terrifying experiences I have ever had..I could not push the car to the side of the road it was stuck right where it broke.
 Finally Managed to get out of my car after several people blocked traffic and routed it around the stranded jeep.
I opened the hood all the transmission fluid coolant
or transmission fluid I do not know which was on the ground.

I have had my Grand Cherokee for a week.
It has been an improvement over what I had before.

The only concern I have is the transmission.

Does anyone have a hesitation when the accelerate from a stop and then it kicks in and when braking does it feel like a slip in the transmission?
