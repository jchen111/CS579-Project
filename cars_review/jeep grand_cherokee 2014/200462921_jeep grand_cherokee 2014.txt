I've owned my 2014 GC Overland V8 for about 6 months. After 3 months my screen froze and radio/hvac went haywire. The radio froze on full blast and the hvac froze on full heat. The knobs did nothing and the touch screen was completely frozen.
Screen/radio unit was completely replaced. Dealer forgot to transfer my sirius subscription, so spent over an hour on the phone with sirius explaining that I did not purchase a new radio, blah, blah.


New unit seemed to solve my problems. Then about three months later, the screen completely turned off as I was on the highway. Been dead for about a month. No radio, backup camera, etc. Dealer is going to replace unit AGAIN.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We experienced electrical problems 3 weeks after buying it.
We opted for the 5.7 V8 Overland with QuadraDrive II.
Check the Jeep forums to know problems associated with each model.
Our Jeep Grand Cherokee had a check engine light turn on and off randomly.
The shut off while the car was in drive, the air suspension raised and lowered, the windshield wipers would come on and off, the headlights would shut off in the middle of the night, and the doors would unlock themselves while the car was parked randomly.
My wife was stuck at the mall for 3 hrs when the car would not turn on.
The dealership tried to fix the car for 6 months to no available and we were without a loaner for initially.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It could be an excellent vehicle, sharp looking, fun to drive and all the bells. But there is where it stops. My first american car after over 18 years of Japanese and German. To put it short, the most expensive and also worst vehicle I have ever bought/owner. Just within 5000 miles I had the car at the dealership for the same electronic issue and they still could not figured it out. I never had so much stress owning any vehicle. Finally I had enough and traded it in after only five months of ownership. What a pity. It is absolutely sad, that Chrysler has not more pride in their product. Consequently this will be my last Chrysler product ever.

This Review is for a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland 4X4 EcoDiesel (EDMUNDS Please Add This Engine Choice)Additional features on this already highly capable SUV include the Advanced Technology Package.

Despite being a Jeep family and a GC fan, I did a substantial amount of research before purchasing this $50K SUV given the amount of recalls on Chrysler products recently. I looked at BMW, Porsche, and Land Rover but could not find an SUV that even came close for the $50K price point anywhere close to new (or even slightly used). It is important to note this configuration with the Diesel engine literally has almost every feature and is more than enough SUV for most people.

Gas pedal delayed response almost causing accident. I accelerated at stop sign man decided to cross street I saw him. put my foot on break. had to apply break hard because accelerator finally responded. I looked down at the gas pedal to see if my foot was on both pedals but I was only on the break.
This is not a wish list but is a serious defect & needs to be recalled & fixed. it could have caused that man his life, & I would have to live with the guilt. Took delivery April 2014. car is 2014 model. I have complained about lag time & they say its now computerized instead of direct linkage. & my security breach by Bluetooth on 24/7 even without keys in car
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well I never thought I would have to write a review. After working for Chrysler for 42 years and driven nothing but Chrysler producst I'm about to change. I purchased a 2014 Jeep Overland and have had to return it to the shop several times for transmission problems. Trans is a 8 speed and it really sucks. Jerks forward to approx. 2800 -3000 rpm. when starting out. When merging into traffic no response when accelerator is pressed then jumps into passing gear. Thought I was back in the sixties again. Dealership tells me that it is the characteristic of that vehicle. Well when you buy a $50000.00 vehicle you kind of expect everything to be right. Ok I think I'll try a Ford.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We bought our 2014 Overland in December of 2013.
It isn't six months old yet, and the leather is pealing on the lower part of the driver's side seat.
We had to make two trips to the dealership in order to have the manager take pictures so that he could then send them to Chrysler.
Chrysler says they will not fix it.
Too bad, because other than the leather pealing, it is a great vehicle.
However, I am afraid to think of what I would have to prove if something went wrong with the drive train.
BUYER BEWARE.
If they won't fix something small like leather, what will happen with something big?

I have owned 8 SUVs.
 Including explorer, expedition 4 runner and sequoia.


Best SUV ever by far.
 Better interior than any foreign car I have owned.

'14 GC Overland 5.7L Hemi 4 x 4 with ATG
Build Nov. 2013-- '14 is my 4th JGC since '99, and by far the BEST.
I've had ZERO issues--major or minor since bought in Dec. '13 @ 3,000 miles now--mixture of heavy city & highway.
I've put this vehicle through the paces.
As far as reliability, my Jeeps have only once left me stranded--dead battery.
'05 GC at 80k mi needed transfer case replaced, but Jeep could be driven.
10 days in shop, but all under warranty.
After reading all negative reviews on transmission and NAV system, rented one before buying--NO ISSUES.
This is a German designed & built transm. used in all new Audi, BMW, even Jag, Bentley, Rolls, Land Rover, Maserati.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just bought the Overland 4x4 V6 and I do love it.
However, it appears that it still has glitches.
I would give it 5 stars but my must have Samsung Galaxy Note 3 can't pair with the Uconnect/Nav/Stereo system.
Confirmed with manufacturer that it's still behind in addressing the issue.
In fact, if you look at their compatibility list, it's a short list.
Pathetic that Jeep/Chrysler/Uconnect can't address this issue.
Also, there appears to be some concerns with the Front Collision Warning system.
Many can't verify if this system actually works.
Also, system appears to work differently when Adaptive Cruise Control is on versus off.
Hope Chrysler reads this and address these issues.
