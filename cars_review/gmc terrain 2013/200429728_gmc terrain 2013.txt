I researched several SUVs before I decided to lease the 2013 Terrain AWD Denali in October 2013 and I love it!

The V-6 provides a quiet, smooth ride.
I love the red accent lighting and red stitching on the seats and dash.
The back seat also has lots of leg room which is nice because a lot of my friends are tall.
The backup camera needs a little work.
It gets dirty easily and depth perception is off.
Usually the longer I have a vehicle, the more I find that I don't like about it but the longer I have this SUV, the more I love it!
