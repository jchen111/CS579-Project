We were very fortunate to have over $4000 in GM card points that were allowed to be transferred to an immediate family member, so a Chevy or GM product was a definite choice.
We looked at several models and the Sonic Sedan was the best choice based on price, safety, features and overall performance.
 She was able to get a lot of the bells and whistles and still keep the car within her price range.
