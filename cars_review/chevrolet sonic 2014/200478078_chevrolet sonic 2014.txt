I've only had the car for a few days so my enthusiasm may be subject to change.
We just took delivery of a LTZ sedan with the 1.4 turbo and a six-speed manual transmission.
I'm very impressed.
Quite peppy in city driving.
We just took a highway ride and ran at speeds up to 80 mph and averaged 39 mpg.
Amazing!
Very solid ride and quiet with little wind noise.
Amazing amount of legroom and headroom for driver and front seat passenger.
I'm six-two and had to move the seat up and had tons of headroom.
I liked the look of the hatchback better but lower price and huge trunk made me pick ther sedan.
We paid less than 18K; I can't think of any car out there to offer this value.
