So today was probably the perfect scenario for driving the new 2013 Club spec Miata.
Sun was shining, not a single cloud in the sky, and traffic was minimul.
It took some getting used to with the short throw 6 speed amnual and the quick to react ABS.
The 2.0 DOHC puts all 167 horses on the ground thanks to the 4.10 rear end.
I am very particualr when it comes to sports cars, but this one kept me smiling.
You already expect these sporty special editions to have a horrid ride quality, however mazda found a nice medium between comfort and harshness.
I would Highly recomend this car to drivers who want to race the tracks on saturday, and enjoy small trips to the store on monday.
