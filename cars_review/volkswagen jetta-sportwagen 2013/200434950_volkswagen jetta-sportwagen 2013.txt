I am really very impressed by the features and value of the base model Sportwagen S.
If you are looking for an upscale interior and a large cargo area, there really isn't another vehicle that compares.
It is comfortable to sit in, drives very well, and comes equipped with virtually all the features one would look for in a daily driver.
