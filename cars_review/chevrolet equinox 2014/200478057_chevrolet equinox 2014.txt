I have had this car for over 6 months and 12, miles, and have not had a single problem with it.
It handled this past NJ winter snow/cold without a whimper.
Didn't need AWD in the snow. I have gotten 32 MPG straight highway and 27 MPG mixed.
Could I think of things to add to the car to make it better?
Who couldn't.
But I am happy with this car and the price I paid for it. It is a very comfortable car with a great engine and great milage.

3 weeks ago I purchased a 2014 Chevy Equinox 2LT, 4 cylinder front wheel drive.

Listed price is: $33,800
Current Mileage: 1,400

I have always been a "Buy American" supporter, that is until the mid-2000's when I had my last GM product which was as bad of a car as you could ask for.
Figured its now 2014 and I should give GM a try again after some reviews of similar vehicles seemed to be fairly good, TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

I could write an entire list of issues on this car if the review would let me.
1 point I must make is that within the 1,400 miles of owning this car, it has now been towed 2 times to the dealership for leaving me stranded on the road.

I bought a 2014 2LT in Champagne, with sunroof and 18 inch wheels.
This car is very comfortable, and is fun to drive.
I get 26MPG combined, and I drive exactly the same highway miles as city on the way to work daily. I have 6K miles on it, and am very impressed with this vehicle. The I4 engine is surprisingly fast, and my last vehicle had a V6. The car was built to be comfortable, so who cares how many more square inches of cargo room the competition has? I have no problem hauling my carpentry tools around, and I have a lot of tools.
Take a good look at the Equinox, and decide for yourself.
 No cliche intended.
