Based on Internet reviews and comments, I bought a 2014 1LT Equinox with the 6-cylinder engine.  I now have 600 miles on the vehicle, and am very satisfied.  Acceleration is great, it is comfortable and quiet, and it drives and handles well.  (On that latter point, I have seen comments about less than precise steering & handling.  I have not noticed that in my Equinox, and wonder if that has to do with the fact that the 4-cylinder Equinox has electric power steering, while the 6-cylinder has hydraulic power steering.) BTW, my gas mileage with the V6 has been HIGHER than the EPA estimate - even during break-in.

My wife fell in love with the Equinox in White Diamond.
 Lots of room inside.
Well laid out dash. Shift smoothly.
We went with a 4 cyl. Great on gas mileage a little lite in power.
