As others vehicle shudders at low speed
but not consistenly and never in the shop and nor did our dearship know or ever heard of this problem.
On recent vacation when our car was lowed to the nearest dealership, that's an enitely different story, we mentioned it to the service manager who know exactly what I was talking as soon as I said transmission problems.
They have replace two transmissions already with the exact same issue.
Conclusion is we mentioned it yet a third time to our local dealership who finally tried some thing revolutionary and looked up the problem on the internet!
Finally agreed to address the issue.
New transmission being installed as we speak.

over all its exactly what we wanted in its class but have had nothing but problems. long story we had a 2013 pathfinder s class for 2 weeks and a Nissan tech smashed it into another customers car. they gave us a 2014 in place.
We got it in Aug 2013, we reported a burning coolant smell in Nov 2013 with only 10 500 km.
even though I can smell it in the car with my wife and 4 kids present, Nissan still says its within normal running operations. I also had both front wheel bearings replaced at 30000 km. now Nissan is refusing to take the coolant issue any further. not impressed what so ever! they say that its a common problem yet we looked online & nobody has had the same problem.

I will make it short. what's the point of buying a new car if i have to keep going back to service almost every other week? Nissan decided to change the transmission 2 weeks after i purchased the car cause of shaking problem. then again in April 2014 cause of the same problem. and now i feel i wasted over 30,000 on piece of junk. while driving on highway car is shaking vigorously. there are already 4 recalls on the car. I will never buy a nissan again.
