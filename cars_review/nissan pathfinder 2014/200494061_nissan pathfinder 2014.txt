This has been the absolute worst car experience I have ever had.
We really wanted an SUV with three rows and decent gas mileage.
We were exited when we found
the Pathfinder Hybrid with promises of 25 miles to the gallon in the city and 28 on the highway.
This all seemed too good to be true so we bought it.
By day 2 I was very frustrated as I was getting 14 miles to the gallon!
I tried to return the car but was told to keep driving, it would get better or Nissan would have to do something.
Now I have driven over 1000 miles and
seem to be getting about 17 miles to the gallon a far cry form 25!
I have talked to
Consumer Affairs as well as the dealership and no one has done anything.
