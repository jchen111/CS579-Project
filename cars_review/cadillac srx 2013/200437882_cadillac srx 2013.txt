'We bought this Performance fwd model for the Mrs' daily "around town" car about six months ago.
Our friends and family love its snappy looks which draws a lot of attention.
It's exciting to drive and ride in.
Powerful engine/transmission drive line.
Sporty handling, comfortable seats and ride.
Lots of room in front, but legroom in rear is tight when front seat(s) are all the way back.
Beautiful, luxurious, quiet interior.
The CUE system?
Well, just like our iPhones it's a fun challenge, and we are conquering both.
We wouldn't want to do without either.

a metal plate struck one of the rear tires.
got a flat tire.
when called for roadside assistance (RSA), I was asked do your car came with a donut spare tire or with a compresor repair kit?
 To my surprise, it came with the C-repair kit
;-(
 It was a nightmare!!!
 RSA was no helpful, a tow truck was going to take 1.5 to show up,...4hrs later I went home, left the car in my work place parking overnight.
 How come when the dealer sell you the car does not tell you about the NO spare tire ;-(

This is ridiculous!!!

 I am so disappointed that a so expensive luxury car does not come with a spare tire.

Today the dealer is going to hear me...

sorry, I am really upsep
;-(
