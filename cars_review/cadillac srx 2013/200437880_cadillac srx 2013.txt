The SRX handles well, especially on highways; but visibility is an issue. The rear view mirror is too small so you really need those side mirrors. Having the defensive driving add in helps. On the highway I have managed to get 24 mpg. The CUE system needs some major improvements as it is totally non-intuitive. And the HD radio can go as it just makes it difficult to hold on to a station.

I am very disappointed in my SRX. It is uncomfortable, visibility is poor, road noise is high, the transmission shifts rough, and the CUE system is difficult to use in traffic.
