I had this vehicle for about 2k miles. I found the steering heavy at slow speeds probably based on the all wheel drive system. Brake pedal is a bit heavy although that may be because this model is quite heavy. Weighting in just under 6k.
Despise small flaws this luxury model SRX comes with lots of toys. Heated steering wheel and seats. On star and XM radio. Backup camera and both rear and front parking sensors. The front parking sensors comes equipped with an on off setting as well. This model can be completely keyless. The doors has sensor touch on the all doors allowing access into the vehicle with the key fob in pocket. Keyless start and automatic rear lift gate.

Turned in our 2010 SRX at lease termination last month in exchange for a 2013 and am delighted with the new 2013 version.
While I liked the 2010 it had several shortcomings including the engine and a lack of some features.
The 2013 has addressed all these concerns and more.
The engine is superb, smooth and powerful and there are lots of additional features which I love including a heated steering wheel, and many more.
And, the new CUE system is awesome.
There is absolutely no shortcoming I can find, only complete satisfaction.
Highly recommended.
