We have a 2013 Cadillac SRX Premium Edition, FWD.
I purchased this vehicle for my wife, but to be honest about it, I love it too!!!

We have 1000 miles on the vehicle as I write this review, thus this will only include our initial impressions.


Overall I would rate the vehicle a 10+ on features and styling.
I would rate it at 6-7 regarding fuel economy.
I give it a 9 on handling.
