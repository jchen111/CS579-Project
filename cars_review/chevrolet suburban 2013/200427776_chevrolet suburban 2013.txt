I'd had a Chevy Tahoe that I basically drove into the ground after 16 years and almost 200k miles, it was time to let it go.
I liked the car so decided to go with a Suburban because of the extra room.
Biggest financial blunder of my adult life.
I've only had the car about 9 months, so I can't really comment on the bones.
I was shocked that so much of the body is now cheap plastic.
As far as technology goes, I'm surprised it even has a radio.
It's so far behind the times that it's an embarrassment to drive in Silicon Valley.
I kid you not, my motorcycle helmet has a better designed "infotainment" system.
