I bought this car for my wife to replace her aging 03 Honda Pilot.  Overall it has been a very good car.  Easy to drive, plenty of interior room, very comfortable on long trips, and excellent highway mpgs.  Last month, saw over 35 mpg at 70 mph.  City mileage, running errands mpg drops to low 20's.  
I have changed the oil twice, replaced the cabin and air filter and the wipers.  Has been dead reliable, uses no oil between oil changes.  Very solid car!

We just completed our 2nd road trip, and averaged 32.5 mpg in 700 miles of average speeds between 70-80 mph.
Very easy and relaxed to drive this small suv.
My wife loves driving this compared to her Honda Pilot.
It handles fine, soaks up bumps very well and has a very generous amount of interior room. I know it's only is a 5 speed auto, but it downshifts smartly and very rarely do I feel it needs more power.
Overall a very solid car!
