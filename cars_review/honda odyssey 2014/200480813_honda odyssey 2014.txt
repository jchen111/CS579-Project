We have four kids ages 5-12, and this car just replaced our 2008 Touring.
Honda just does a minivan right - this thing is a great kid-hauler.
It has slightly more room inside than our '08, yet the van looks lower, sleeker, and less boxy than our old van.
Decent acceleration, great turn radius, and quality interior materials.
We have yet to hit the EPA mileage in the highway but on our only long trip in it thus far we had a cargo bag on the roof - which probably explains the 23 MPG.
Thing drives much smaller than out is.

This is our fifth Honda.
We bought it for the reliability that we have come to love and expect from Honda.
The transmission is worthless in this vehicle.
It jerks violently between 1st and 2nd gear.
The problem is intermittent, but happens quite often (especially in Houston heat).
I have brought it in 3 times now and the dealer thinks I am crazy.
I spent $41,000 on a piece of trash.
I am absolutely beside myself with frustration.
I intend to pursue the lemon-law in the wonderful state of Texas.
I would not wish this vehicle on my worst enemy!
