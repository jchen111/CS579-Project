Before I purchased
this car I talked to a number of people who owned one and generally everyone gave it an "A" grade.
Now that I have purchase mine, I AGREE COMPLETELY, with the exception of IT NEEDS MORE HORSEPOWER to keep competitive with the Mercedes S550 and BMW 750 series.
I always enjoy getting into my new Lexus LS460 to drive it, and on top of my enjoyment I have received numerous compliments.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Must say that the LS460 F Sport is much better choice then the regular model in its class.
Before buying this LS, I drove the 750IL, S-class and A8.
I find the LS Sport is the best choice overall in terms of looks, feels and comfort. The exterior of this the F Sport in white makes the 2014 S-class, Audi A8 or 750IL looking ugly.
Lexus has done an outstanding job in the new body stye and the reason why I bought the F sport model.
especially in the F Sport Model. It rides like butter in any condition.
For the money and it's Lexus I wouldn't think twice.
I owned the CL550 AMG 2010 and traded in for this F Sport in Aug 30 and it has been a joyable ride so far.
Highly recommended car.
