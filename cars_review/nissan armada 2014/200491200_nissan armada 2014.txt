Got the truck from CarMax Nissan in MD.
The truck is very comfortable to drive, and very roomy inside.

I actually use the features of a large SUV. I frequently use seating for 8 so a 2nd row bench seat was a must have feature.
Leather seats and DVs were a required luxury.

In addition I wanted actual tires, not the wagon wheels that new SUVs come equipped with recently. 

Believe it or not, that is a very difficult combination to find in today's market.
I was surprised to find the luxury and utility combination I needed in the Nissan Armada.
Glad I did.


Very nice running, powerful, luxurious and filled with usable technology.
All seats are comfortable with good legroom. Whole family loves it on the highway, dirt roads and around town.
Price is very good for the group.
