I leased my 2014 Lexus RX 350 last October, so it's been almost one year. Has all bells and whistles. I really love my car. Very quite ride, comfortable seats. Back seat passengers are pleased with all the leg room. Car feels very safe. The worst part of my Lexus experience was dealing with Lexus of Sacramento. But I have found other Lexus dealers much more professional for which I am very thankful.

we had just purchased our third Lexus plus our sixth Toyota. my husband was having dizzy spells and horrible headaches after thousands of dollars in medical bills we found out that there was a ripple in the windshield that was causing this! took car into lexus said they could not fix this and there was nothing more todo
but when they had it in the shop that day they gave us a rental same make and model and same year and no ripple! they told us it was a 2013 when we brought it back a different car porter told us that it was a in fact a 2014.

I bought a 2014 RX350 with all wheel drive and 19 inch wheels as options, not the Sport which has a sport tuned suspension also and is not recommended here. This set up gives great handling and a quiet smooth ride. After reading about a cushy ride and lack of feel for the road my biggest surprise was just the opposite with this set up.

This vehicle is excellent.
My wife loves her RX 350 and even though it's not as fun to drive as my Jaguar I can say with complete sincerity that if I had to choose between the two the Lexus would win every time.
Handles well.
Quiet.
Extremely comfortable seats and ride.
I'd highly recommend this SUV to anyone with a family.
There is plenty of room for the kids in the back.

I just bought a brand new 2014 RX 350 SUV from IRA Lexus in bedford nh. When we drove the car home we noticed vibration when switching gear on the freeway. The transmission was defective and needed to be replaced.
