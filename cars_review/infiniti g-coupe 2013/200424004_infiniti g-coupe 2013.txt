Having spent the past 14 years with an ultimate driving machine and after seeing the professional reviews, I initially didn't have high expectations for the IPL coupe.

I was pleasantly surprised.
This is one of the few beautiful coupes that are still made.
It's a well build and layed out car.
When driven mildly, it's a well composed tourer.
When driven agressively, it provides a high level of confidence for the causal driver.

At it's heart is a long time award winning engine matched to a capable transmission.

If you're tire of performance vehicles that are great track machines, but harsh daily drivers, you owe it to yourself to take a test drive.
