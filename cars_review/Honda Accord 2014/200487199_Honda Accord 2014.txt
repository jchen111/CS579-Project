My recent purchase of a 2014 Honda Accord EXL-V6 was my first for this make and probably my last.
The car has the most value per dollar of any others we looked at including Avalon, Lexus 350kRX, Altima, Chevy Impala, Ford models, Infiniti G-37 and Q50.
Interior and exterior design is first class, controls are easy to use, very roomy interior and comfortable seating, large trunk space, etc.
And the ride is like a dream...a very, very, bad dream.
Whoever decided that family sedans should have a sport or firm suspension system need to have his head examined.
Unless the streets and highways are new and exceptionally smooth, the ride almost shakes the fillings out of my teeth.
