I am a previous owner of a Nissan Maxima, which had a sport suspension.  In that car I did feel lots of bumps, but body roll was minimal, and the ride felt composed.  I mention the above because I don't think I am hypercritical.  This car has the worst suspension I have ever encountered, I am disgusted every time i drive it and i will be selling it within a year.  Not only do you feel every bump, there is a huge amount of body roll, and I would say it feels wild and out of control on the highway if you do anything outside of a textbook lane change.  I am beside myself that others do not feel the same.

The road noise is so great in my $32,000 Honda Accord that my husband will not travel with me. I went to Winter Haven FL Honda dealer about the road noise when traveling above 60mph. In short.. They said I had to live with it because it was the nature of the car.


My 2006 Honda Accord did not have this type of road noise.

After going through hell with an old German car, I decided to get a new car.
This one was it.
I drive approximately 30-50 Thousand miles a year so long term reliability was my key.
You cannot go wrong with this car.
So far so good.
I already have almost 3,000 miles.
With the exception of the ride quality my suggested improvements are few.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Waited a few months before reviewing, so I could get a full grasp on the car. Honda has hit a price-value sweet spot, especially with the LX model. Features at the entry price is amazing (see fav features). Compared against a Camry SE, Altima S, Mazda 6 (2014MY Mazda 3 is way better than the 6) and this was THE best bang for the buck. Love the handling, gas mileage, and the front design. No complaints with the seats or the CVT (although I had some concerns before purchase). After researching, found that the CVT judder was mostly relegated to the '13 MY Accords (TSB fix issued by Honda). This fix has been implemented on '14 MY Accords and I have no major issues with the CVT (@6k miles now)

I've had the '14 Accord LX for a few months now. Paid $19,000 in SoCal.
Pros:
I have had NO problems (shaking, judders, shudders, etc) with the CVT. Smooth acceleration and shifting (or whatever it is). Steering is light and responsive. Rearview camera with active guides (it takes awhile to get used to what the lines mean on the guides)

Cons:
It doesn't support iOS (iphone), so I switched to android. On the drivers side outside mirror, the outer edge is distorted and it's a little distracting, i'm not sure what it's supposed to do, but it's a fail. The 4 speaker sound system sounds kinda crappy. Small fingerprint-sized area of paint on the hood is slightly dull looking.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My first Accord, previously I owned a 2012 Civic LX and was looking to upgrade.
I couldn't be happier.
One thing other reviews tend to gloss over is the large amount of standard features on the base trims.
I have the standard LX model, with CVT transmission.
This car is very quick, acceleration is excellent and steering feels natural.
