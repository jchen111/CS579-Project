After test driving what some automotive magazines ranked as the top three automobiles in this class (Mazda6, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima), the Honda Accord Sport pleasantly surprised me by overtaking the number one pick for those same reviews: the Mazda6 iTouring.
Having been a former Acura Legend owner, I felt right at home again behind the wheel of the Accord. The Sport's numbers outperform the Mazda not only on paper, but in driving tests as well. I felt solidly in control at all times behind the wheel of the Accord, even with electric power steering. Active noise cancellation helps to quiet the cabin as well. Fantastic car all around!

Just purchased my '14 Accord Sport in June - have 2,000 miles now and a couple of road trips taken.
Excellent handling car with great road manners!
My 94 Accord coupe was my best car ever - this 14 continues that tradition of a solid, well built and handling car.
The CVT is great and unobtrusive - the computer simulates a conventional automatic.
Great MPG and very responsive throttle.
Supportive seats (love the power seat and lumbar) and a very spacious and comfortable cabin round out the package.
I traded out of an 11 Altima and its the best choice I have made.
No complaints about this car other than a suggestion:
the Sport needs a better sound system with more speakers...

This Honda is the best Honda I have ever owned.it is a thrill to drive. The sport mode with the shifter paddles makes it drive like a manual transmission. It has plenty of power expecially using the sport mode. It has a sporty feel while driving it. It really hugs the road. The seats are really comfortable and the material is awesome. I love the carbon fiber. The steering wheel is wrapped in leather and feels awesome. The tinted glass is really nice. I have nothing bad to say about this car.

Bought the Sport model because I loooove the look of the 18" wheels and tires. 10 minute test drive went okay. Didn't notice until I drove 30 minutes to work that the seats are terrible! There's not enough padding in the backrest and the head rest/restraints push your head too far forward. After 20 minutes my neck and back were killing me. Almost like the seats are trying to push you into the fetal position. I looove everything about the car except those da#mn seats. I heartbroken that I love the car so much but don't enjoy driving it because of the uncomfortable seats.

I picked up my Blue (I forget the original name for the color) Honda Accord Sport 3 days ago.
I was coming from a 2006 Toyota Camry SE and wasn't looking to trade it in, but the dealer gave me a good sizeable amt on it.
After getting in and driving it, its like a dream.
The Bluetooth, The Ride, The Seats, The 18in Rims.....the whole Sport Package.
And thanks to Big Star Honda in Houston for making the process so much earlier than I thought.
I was more inclined to the Mazda 6 (I owned a 2004 Mazda 3, but ran into alot of issues) before considering the Honda, but with everyone in your family with a Honda with a proven record, it was a question of don't take a chance....just go for it.

Did extensive review research for a sporty mid-sized sedan for around $25k. 3 made the short list Mazda 6 Touring, Subaru Legacy Sport and Honda Accord Sport. 3 quality cars. Legacy AWD makes it super-handler but less roomy and new model coming next year (worth a serious look i'm sure). Mazda 6 great looking, solid perfromance and excellent quality cabin. Accord Sport just pipped the 6 for it's understated but sporty trim, perfect balance & agility and sport mode gearing. It lacks a few creature comforts but for sheer driving experience and outstanding value it's the winner.
