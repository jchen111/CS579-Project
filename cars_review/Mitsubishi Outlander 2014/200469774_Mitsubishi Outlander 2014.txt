Bought the car a little over a month ago and now have 1200 miles on it.
I really like the new design, the fact that it comes standard with 3 rows of seats.
The interior isn't flashy but it doesn't seem like cheap plastic either.
I like the touch screen radio, backup cam, 18 inch wheels, heated seats, integrated blue tooth, fog lights ect. and all the other options for the price over competing SUV's.
I was really considering the Subaru Forester, but the price and the 3rd row of seats sealed the deal.
The factory Warranty is by far better.
I've owned an 02 Lancer,
an 03 Eclipse and never had any trouble with either.
Getting about 25MPG, which is a little lower than I was hoping.

Just picked up a 2014 Outlander SE AWD with the Touring package today.
I am in love with this car.
It could use a bit more power.
But, honestly, the power is more than adequate, I think I'm just gluttonous.


The exterior is more gorgeous in pictures than you can see online, and the interior is very well-crafted and classically designed - modern without being trendy.

For the price, the features and quality can't be beat.

Oh, and the 710 watt Rockford Fosgate stereo?
Ummm...insane.

Just hit 3,000 miles and mileage is more like 17-25 mpg. Doors are really light, back gate doesn't always open, a # of features are stripped out in the SE so some things you would expect aren't included. Bluetooth doesn't always work so I make a call, they hear me but I don't know it's even connected. Wipers spray over the windshield/crooked. Remote start is a joke, need to start again when in car. The only comfortable spot for the steering wheel will block your dash. Two days after leasing, had major mechanical issue. Second lease payment they didn't notify me of automatic payments starting so I made a payment and then they pulled as well,
overdrafted my account for following directions.

Do not trust the reviewers. This vehicle deserves to be test driven. The material quality is fantastic inside. Mitsubishi did not cheap out and use tons of hard plastic like the rest of the competition. I think the exterior looks classy and is similar to the Land Rover Range Rover or 1st gen Cayanne. The 3rd row is usable because the second row can be moved up without losing that much legroom. I'm 5'5" and I was able to sit in the 3rd row. I wouldn't want to sit there for long trips but it should be fine for my needs around town. I can't wait to try out the 4wd on the snow. I believe it has much better ground clearance and 4wd system than the CR-V. I'm getting 25 mpg on mostly city driving.
