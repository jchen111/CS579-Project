After 2 new Cadillacs and making the change to BMW in May, I have been very disappointed. First off when I drove the brakes had to be replaced with less than 1000 miles.
The On/Off functionality is stupid.
When you park the car it shuts off except for the accessories and you have to turn it on and then off again which causes wear and tear per the manual.
And after 4 months apparently there was liquid spilled on the iDrive which caused it to be replaced for the cost of $650.
Unbelievable design to put an electronic iDrive between 2 cup holders that can't withstand condensation from a cup.
Cheap interior as well.
Never Again!

I bought this X1 because it's a dying breed of BMW from times before BMW went soft, heavy, and lost their steering mojo. It has the chassis and handling dynamics from the previous generation E90/E91 platform that's one of the best handling 3 series. It has hydraulic steering instead of BMW's new vague, imprecise electric steering. Those are combined with the most recent, excellent drive train. Add the comparatively low price and this BMW is unique. It will be replaced in the 2016 model year by a front-wheel drive platform shared with the Mini Cooper. Yuck.

I was a bit concerned about the 4 cylinder engine but boy does it still provide a lot of pep.
Lots of grip. Feels like I am driving an expensive sports sedan. Has the same confident, lane-holding feel when you are zipping down the far left lane on the highway like you feel in an X5.
Lots of room in the front, though not much for storage.
There are only 2 safety belts in the rear though there is room for a 3rd person in the middle.
Because of the 40/20/40 split, there is a lot of storage flexibility.
The fuel economy is nice too.
I bought mine as a service loaner w 4K miles and WHAT A VALUE at around $31K.
I am as satisfied with this vehicle as with any vehicle previously owned.
