I can't say much about it, I got it for wife who said she wanted a hatchback with pep.  These criteria took me to the VW GTI, a very highly rated and affordable car.  We test drove one of those, and wife found it too low, and plain looking.  She somehow decided it was a "kid car".
I was frustrated and so surfed to the X1.
Wife loved it's classy look (the BMW emblem on it didn't hurt anything), it's higher stance, and was very happy driving it.  It's amazingly affordable.
Her's has the moonroof and the nice rain-sensing wipers. Most other features are standard.
We picked out one of 3 white ones on the lot, I would have liked the premium audio and upgraded rearview with compass

I traded in my old (and long out of warranty 2005 325i) for new X1 with premium package.
Note: I got it cheaper than edmunds suggested price, so use it as trading starting point

So far I have 400 miles only and will try to update it later. But for now I am very biased and I like this car. I like driving and this one just pure joy. However my old 325i could turn sharper (X1 center of gravity is higher). Also turbo does not respond as fast as my previous car's 6cil from dead stop. There is a short delay and then turbo delivers massive torque and then traction control has to work hard ;)
On the hiway its pure joy, power is always there when you need it. At 400 mi I got 26+ mpg, no eco-pro
