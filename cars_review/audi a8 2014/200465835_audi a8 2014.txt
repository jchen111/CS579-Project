I have owned Audi A8 sedans previously but switched to Mercedes S Class a few years ago - all of these high tech sedans can be problematic due to the complexity of their electronic systems - so be prepared to buy only from a dealer with 5 star service - recently, I was intrigued by the 2014 A8L TDI diesel sedan's specs and options so I acquired one - it does everything right, especially fuel mileage which surpasses my expectations - the A8L is "sized right" as compared to the lumbering S550 - the diesel performance is outstanding - the electronic gizmos are entertaining but most are not necessary for daily use - cons - lots of road noise from stiff tires, mediocre stereo, electronic failures
