This is my very first light weight truck and I will tell you I love the way it handles and I drive manual so the 6 speed if great, fast pick up in speed, great to take out on the trail. 
This truck out shines all the GMC light weight and Chevys light weight is how well made it is nothing cheap on the Frontier.
Looking very forward to many years with this truck.
Well worth what I paid.
