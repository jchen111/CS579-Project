I owned a Tacoma TRD crew cab and while I enjoyed the truck, I didn't enjoy paying for it.
A few years later, I find myself in the market for another vehicle, so I gave the 2014 Frontier SV 4x4 a try... and it's every bit as great as the Tacoma, minus the sticker shock.
It handles great, rides smooth (takes potholes in Northern Virginia like a champ), has a lot of get-up-and-go, and the interior is even more comfortable than my Tacoma was.
I'm looking forward to owning this truck for many, many years.
