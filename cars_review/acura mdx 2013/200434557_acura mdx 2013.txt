Have had the MDX for about two months.
Other than MPG, nothing to complain about.
Performance is outstanding for an CUV/SUV.
MDX is actually fun to drive on a winding rural road.

No noted squeaks or rattles.
Things seem solid.

Had a 2012 RDX and the MDX is far better.

Acura dealers discounting due to coming 2014 model can result in a very attractive deal.
