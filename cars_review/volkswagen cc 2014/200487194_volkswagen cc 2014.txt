This is my second VW CC.
 I traded my 2011 CC Sport 2.0 for a 2014 CC V6R 4Motion.
 Also researched and priced Audi A6 3.0, Audi A5 Cabriolet, and BMW 535.
 The CC V6 AWD Executive offers nearly all the same features and quality with exceptional styling, comfort, and ergonomics.
 IMO drives very similar to the Audi A6 3.0 Quattro for nearly $20k less.
