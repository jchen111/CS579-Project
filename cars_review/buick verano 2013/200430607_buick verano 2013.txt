I have had the Verano for two years now, and have put approximately 30,000 miles.  Never had a single issue.  The MPG is as it is stated in the sticker, get 32 mpg on highway 70 mph.  The exterior design is elegant, quality is excellent.  The seats are very comfortable, and you can't find a quieter car in this size.  If your do a lot of highway driving, and gas & comfort is essential, you can't go wrong with this car.

We already have an Enclave, which we like, so when my wife's old Cavalier was damaged in a crash we didn't hesitate to go for the Verano. And what a mistake that was. Like the Enclave the Verano is a heavy auto for its size that guzzles fuel and unlike the Enclave, it doesn't make up for it in other ways. The dashboard knobs feel cheap and require more effort to press than the Enclave. The green-white information screen looks like a two-tone video game from the 1980s. The engine sounds like a lawnmower. I test drove the version with the more powerful engine and didn't notice much difference. The view from the back isn't great. I must say this vehicle is a real disappointment.

My husband absolutely loved his 2013 Verano. It was his "baby".
Sadly, it was recently hit by a Semi truck on the freeway (Semi driver's fault).
My husband is undergoing neck, back and shoulder treatments, but he walked away from this accident.
The Verano did its job of protecting him.
The car was totaled all the way around it, but the passenger compartment stayed in tact, airbags deployed as they were supposed to and all the exterior safety features did their job so that the most important possession inside the car (my husband) was protected.
We are very impressed with the Verano and cannot say enough about this wonderful car.
So grateful to it and to God for protecting my husband!

I've had many small to medium sedans, but this time I wanted a domestic near-luxury compact instead of expensive foreign makes or the usual mid-sized choices. The Verano fit the bill perfectly. Tasteful two-tone interior, understated exterior styling, and perfect size for an empty-nester or young professional. The base motor is only average in terms of power and MPG, but the overall goodness of the car for the price is undeniable. The well-equipped base model seems to be the best value, if you can do without the Convenience or Leather packages.

I thought "Luxury" meant quiet. The road noise is unbearable. I took it back to the dealer and they had me drive another one. Same thing. 
It sounds like you're driving with the door half open. Very disabbointing

the ambient noise level coming from the doors and windows is disappointingly loud. I wrongly assumed that "luxury" meant quiet. WRONG. 
Before buying/leasing a Verano, take it up to 70mph and listen to the road noise.. It's lousy

I just have my Verano for about a month now and I'm very impressed. My ruby red color attracts a lot of attention, and shows off the cars great lines. Great finishes in the interior as well looks like a more expensive car. Very comfortable seats for 4 and big trunk. Car loaded with features. More than enough acceleration. Very happy with my selection!
