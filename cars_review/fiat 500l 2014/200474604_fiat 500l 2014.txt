This has got to be one of the most underrated cars on the market today.  When you strip away the funky exterior (to American tastes) it's a great car, especially in a market segment that has essentially been abandoned.

We bought our 1st 500L (Trekking w/manual trans) back in February.  Loved the car.  Only had minor annoyances (armrest and hand brake operation) that we would have found in any car.  Loved it for day to day driving, loved it on the freeway.  Used it to haul our 2 Great Danes around with us.

When my wife wrecked the car and the insurance company totaled it, we immediately went to another 500L (fully loaded Lounge) without hesitation, because my wife was not hurt at all.

I purchased my 500L in early July 2013.
When I tried to insure it, Progressive had no rate for this vehicle.
This is how early I got in on the 500L.
After 7 months I am more than pleased with the performance, quality, economy and just plain fun.
There have been reports of transmissions issues, and while there were some that had issues, this was caused by a faulty version of the controller software, and has since been corrected.
Those affected became a very vocal group of three or four people who have plastered false info every where they can.
This is proven by the 25,000 plus units with the DDCT, the tens of thousands of Dodge Dart DDCT units and the 100,000+ good units world wide.

I got the car, drove it home, very next day it didn't start.
Took it to the shop, it said, "It's too cold for it here" (Northern Indiana)...Brought it back home, drove it for three days (300 miles) with starting issues...then it totally broke down.
Wouldn't start, stereo was cutting out and blowers on the heater/air conditioner stopped working.
Call for Fiat Roadside assistance, three times a day for 6!!!!! days until they finally came to get it.
Towed it to the shop where it has sat for two weeks.
I am getting the run around completely.

This is a great looking small car with a surprising amount of interior room.
I love the emerald green color that I selected.
It is recommended to use premium gas and the engine does seem to run smoother and more responsive with premium gas.
I am not sold on this "automated manual" transmission.
It feels somewhat unstable and it is difficult to shift from park to reverse when parked on hill with the front of the car higher than the rear.
The gas mileage is subpar for a small front wheel drive car.
I have averaged 25mpg in primarily city driving.
Overall, this car has it perks and drawbacks.
As for competitors: Soul and Juke were too much of a kid car. Encore cramped and Mini CM pricey

I bought my Fiat 500L about 3 weeks ago.
I was on my way to work, when it started shaking and the transmission light came on.
I had to wait for Fiat to open and the car had to be towed in.
This Maxwell Supercenter has no clue how to repair the car and I have been without it for a week.
The manager, Jack M., has been Very difficult and even though I got a call today, after 7 days, I do not feel comfortable and safe in My Fiat.
I plan to return it.
The GM (Lisa C.) here at Austin Fiat has no concern and when my attorney confronts her with the Lemon Law and demands a refund, maybe she will sing a different tune?
I have been stunned at the poor service I have received!

I really like my new 500L but it does not like me. After 6 days, 350ml, it broke down in stop and go traffic on I-25 outside Denver. The twin clutch automatic heated up, smoked and therefore the system shut down. Had roadside assistance tow it back to the Fiat dealer. After setting for three days the car started okay and was drivable. The dealer could not find any problems, the engineer in Italy could not find any problem with the readout data. Their comment was that with the stop and go traffic the 500L twin clutch automatic acted "normally".
So what am I to do?? Not drive the car in USA stop and go traffic?!
Fiat USA is still working with me so hopefully there will be a positive outcome.
