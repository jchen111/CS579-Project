I've owned about 20 cars and trucks in my life and the 500L Trekking is one of the nicest vehicles I have owned.
Nice design. comfortable, smooth ride. Fantastic pick up with the 6 spd. Trekking trim is really great.
plenty of storage.
The front side windshield windows make for great visibility.

The only cons are the armrest is in the way of the hand brake.
But it does fold up out of the way.
And the driver side wiper does not lift up for easy window cleaning and snow clearing.
You have to get the wipers in the "up" position and turn off the car so the wiper stays "up". Then you can lift it up off the window.
That's an oddity.

I 've had the car since November of 2013. It's a Trekking with the 6 speed auto. I love the trans as it reacts like a manual without the fuss. 
I've had the computer flash done, but other than that no issues. 

I love the car. I've read all the complaints that other customers have been having and they have not arrived with my purchase.

Our L family hauler just turned 11k miles. The dual clutch transmission has performed flawlessly despite the recall for the reflash. The winter here in New England has been extremely cold yet we have none of the cold start issues some owners have reported. Warmer spring weather has brought 32-37mpg around town driving. The roads around here are very beat up yet the L remains solid and rattle free. Our family of 5 fits great and any extra luggage goes on the roof. The L is a great buy. Don't let the negative reviews turn you off. Though many are certainly legit, just keep in mind many people abuse their machines and are often the ones who cry the loudest.

I bought a Fiat 500L Trekking in September 2013. To be honest, it took me quite awhile to get used to its rather quirky transmission -- and I have a manual!! The issue was the six gears and the need for a quick shift between first and second. But now that I have gotten used to how and when to shift, I am very happy with my purchase.

This vehicle has all the features of the pricier Honda CRV at about 5K less -- and it looks better and handles better on the road. Last month I took it on a 800 miles road trip and it was so enjoyable to drive.

The gas mileage is also far better than I expected -- I am getting over 29 miles per gallon (combined highway/city).

Traded in a 500 Sport to get a bit more space.
Our Sport had 8,500 miles with zero problems.


We now have 2500 miles on the L.
Very well built.
Both cars were ordered with the manual transmission which I think is a better option.
The negative reviews all seem to be on cars with the auto/dual clutch trans.

Combined mileage is 27.3-mostly around town.
33 mpg on highway.

I purchased a 500L Trekking for my wife three weeks ago.
After the first week, we drove down the road and the transmission was locked in 2nd gear.
It would not shift up or down -- even with auto stick.

We had to pull over and shut the car off -- then it would not restart because it was locked in second gear.
We were stranded on the side of the road.

We eventually made it to the dealership and they gave us a 500L loaner -- the next day the same thing happened with it!

Check the Fiat 500L forums and you'll find that this is a known and common issue.
There are also multiple complaints with the NHTSA.

Two weeks into the repair, there is no word on when we'll get the car back.

I bought this car oct 30 2013. It has been in the shop 4 times for weeks at a time. The check engine lights and transmission lights go on. The whole car has lost power leaving me with no power steering brakes flying down the HWY 70 mph. The car is unsafe. Fiat acts like they never heard of this issue but I have found other people on forums that have had the same so apparently its an issue. I don't feel safe in the car and they are refusing to help me.

This car has excellent interior room for its size.
For me, it is the perfect size vehicle.
I wanted something smaller than a CUV, but still can fit some cargo.
The exterior and interior styling is unique and looks upscale.
The tech is user friendly.
It has plenty of power and can be fun to drive.
I say can because the vents and cheap interior plastic vibrate and rattle if not on a freshly paved road.
Also, I hate to turn off the bass on the Beat audio because it made the plastic on the door rattle.
Forgot putting stuff in the glovebox or center console unless you want the sound of a baby rattle.
Occasionally the car won't kick-on when turning the key, but it has on a 2nd turn.

I loved my 2012 500c but found myself needing something a little larger.
I traded in the cabrio for the new 500L and am very pleased with it so far.
I've only driven 500 miles on the new one, so time will tell if it is as reliable as the little 500 was.
I'm very happy with the Dual Dry Clutch Automatic.
It is fuel efficient and has the pick up I need for merging into heavy traffic on the highway.
Taller people fit well in the car, even with the sunroof.
The car has an excellent ride quality and everything works as it should.
It is comfortable, has great visibility, plus it's fun to drive.
