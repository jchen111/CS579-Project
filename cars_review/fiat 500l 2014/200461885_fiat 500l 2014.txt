I bought a 500L Easy with automated manual transmission from Fiat of Austin in October, 2013. When my wife wanted to purchase the Blue Chiaro color, and the dealer did not have it in stock, or on order, Lisa C., the manager, immediately got on the case, searched the orders coming into the US, and swapped inventory with a regional dealer, getting the color that we wanted. Delivery was smooth, and we (the car and I) got acquainted.
This car is beautifully styled, in and out, is well built, and behaves normally in most unextreme conditions.  It is not perfect....I find the brakes to be a bit "touchy", but they perform well.
I find the transmission quirky, but it performs well.

I downsized to a 500L Easy with a sunroof and automatic from a VW Tiguan.
At first I thought "what have I done?" but after a couple of months, and now that I'm accustomed to the quirky transmission, I totally love this car.
It's very peppy and incredibly easy to maneuver.
I have a 25 mile freeway commute and the 500L handles it with aplomb, and the excellent visibility is a big plus when changing lanes.
Another big plus is how unique it is.
I'm very happy.

We purchased a 500L Easy Rosso Perla with Red/Cementite Seats and sunroof at the end of 11/2014. 

I really enjoy the dual clutch transmission gives me the "manually feel" but I do not wear out my left knee in city traffic.
The adjustability of steering column up/down in/out is excellent.

The vehicle is mainly driven in the city we have done some highway driving one 3 hour trip and the ride was very comfortable.

With the rear seats down I was able to get a 55 inch flat screen TV in the box with about 1'' to spare with length and width in to the 500L.

The 500L has the Daytime running lights which I have enabled.

The UConnect works well with my iPhone.

I really LOVE this car, after last year test driving several cars (soul, mazda, crv, tiguan, etc) , finally found this one to replace my old Honda crv 2000 , I quite love the space and size of the car, and its response to aceleration, my friends like the space in the back seats, is a very good looking car, the BUT is , after a week only , had an issue with the engine /oil , disapointing in a new car, things like this can happen,
and will see if after the fix, car performs well and no more issues.
