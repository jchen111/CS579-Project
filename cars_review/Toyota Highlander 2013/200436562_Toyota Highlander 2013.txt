Less than a week ago I bought a 2013 Highlander Limited with no options or accessories.
I rated it three stars in all categories because I've had it for only a few days.

The good: Exterior is up to Toyota's relatively high standards...fit and finish appear to be good. Interior room is good for four adults. Engine power is adequate for the weight of the vehicle but not superb.

The bad: Entry space at every door is too small. Either the doors don't open wide enough or the seats (even in their most rearward positions) don't allow enough room to comfortably enter the vehicle. The interior has way too many plastic surfaces for a $38K vehicle (more below).

I researched every car in this class and kept coming back to the Highlander.
In sales and I'm a road warrior so comfort, ride, handling and reliability are key.
This car characteristics of a SUV but the ride of a luxury car.


Very happy with my purchase.
However Toyota should include at this price level blind spot sensing mirrors, back up sensors and memory seats.
The nav system is a bit difficult to use and should come with lifetime free updates.
