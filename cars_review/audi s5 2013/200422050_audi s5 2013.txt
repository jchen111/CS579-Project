I have had this car for 4 weeks now, and it is still impressing me.
The power is smooth and strong, it comes on early and just keeps puling hard.
Very addictive.
Handling, is well not as brilliant as my old BMW 330CI, but it is still exceptionaly good.
 This car is very fun to drive and did I mention it has gobs of smooth power.
The quality of the finish, both inside and outside is superb.
Initially I was not sure about the alcantara seat inserts, but now that I have the alcantara, I am 100% sold and glad to have it.
It's superior, both in looks and function and very easy to clean, just wipe with a damp cloth.
It's hard to believe someone would pay extra to not get the alcantara.
