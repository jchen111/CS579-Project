I've owned my 2013 for almost one year.
What's not to like:

1.
AWD
2.
All season QUIET convertible rag top
3.
Google Maps

But there are compromises.
The connectivity in the car requires a paid T-Mobile subscription.
And even with that you only receive limited, general information.
You won't receive personal data from the internet of any kind.
And seriously, who needs a hotspot in a car these days since most everyone is carrying their smart phones?
In an age where a Chrysler has a full touch screen with data shared through a phone Audi falls way short in the tech department.
