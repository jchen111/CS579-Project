Just took delivery of 2013 S5 - wow.
I have been waiting for the V6 in the S5 coupe and it does not disappoint.
The power is smooth and plentiful.
Gearbox is amazing, and while the sound may not be a V8, it makes plenty of fun noises.
The ride is firm for sure, but well damped - car does not crash over bumps and handles uneven pavement well.
The MMI system cleaned up from my 2011 A6, but I am still on the fence with the aerial photos from Google Earth - almost feels a little cluttered.
B&O stereo is okay - not that impressed. 
Overall, an indulgent purchase.
No one is going to say this is good value for $, but if you want fun in a gorgeous package - an S5 is it!
