I'm a teacher, and they reeled me in with the extra discount - and a generous trade-in on my 10-year old New Beetle.
 The car has been more fun than I thought it would be to drive, but I agree with other posters that leaving it in pure auto mode results in a lousy ride.
Even in 'manual' 1st to 2nd is a drag. The little engine does quickly lug out on hills and even slight inclines, but it drops seamlessly into 4th with an easy pull of the shift lever. Gas mileage so far better than advertised.
Plenty of vertical room, but my legs end up jammed against the door and the shifter when it is in 'manual' mode.
Along with the seats being uncomfortable, I am not looking forward to long trips.
