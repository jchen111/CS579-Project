We just took delivery of our Valencia Orange X135 M Sport with all the options.
What a car!!
After driving a few of the competitors, the choice was clear once we drove the X1.
There is nothing like a BMW, and this one is solid.
The layout of the interior is very nice, seats are comfortable, visibility is good, and the Harmon-Kardon sound system is awesome.
You will never think of this car as an SUV when it comes to driving dynamics.
Despite the slightly higher ride height, you may as well be driving a BMW sedan with the older, better, hydraulic steering setup.
Also, this car is an amazing value, coming in nearly fully loaded under 50 grand.
