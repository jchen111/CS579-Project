I have a 2013 X1 x28i
Overall its a lot of fun to drive both acceleration and handling.
It is not really a SUV so if you are expecting a lot of space in the back, you have to put the seats down (which is a bit of a hassle)
It has room for 4 passengers (can do 5 in a pinch) but can't do luggage for 4 
I have had good gas mileage (high 20's) and good reliability
THere are some design features that are engineered not designed (cup holder is added on) but overall a good car

I've had my 28iXdrive for 14 months. This is my daily driver and outside 24/7.
It's a small car, but good for me and my 22 mile daily commute in Chicago Winters. Mine had the heated seats and steering wheel, a must have for cold weather. The steering is so tight and precise. The acceleration of this twin turbo, blows me away, and it just keeps on going.
Excellent handling car, firm suspension. I haven't had any problems at all. Mine retailed over $38k

The X1 is a very solid, high performing compact SUV (or SAV as BMW calls it).
The performance, corning and high quality interior are all amazing.
The car has lots of power.
I only have 3000 miles on the car so far but it handles very well and enjoy the many technology features on car including the numerous I drive features.

I got mine last September and it has been a blast ever since, 15K miles already.
I've picked a Valencia Orange with M Sport Package, heated seats and Harman Kardon sound system, nothing else and the only option I miss is power seats.
This thing drives exceptionally well and the hydraulic assist steering is still the best.
The manner in which this vehicle goes from 60 MPH to 80, 90 or more is almost ridiculous.
Serious handling and solid structure feel make it even
better.
Of note this is my 5th BMW in the last 10 years and so I expect great things from BMW's and in this case they delivered a great little product.
If you can get one and enjoy the ride, you won't be disappointed...

Have driven my X1 over 2000 miles and still the fuel efficiency is only 27.3 max. I drive only highways, use the cruise control, and the eco option.
The steering wheel feels heavy (in comparison with my old SAAB that is a delight to drive) but I will take a bunch of weight lifting classes with a personal trainer starting next week so this should help to drive (no kidding - it is a heavy cow, like it has no power assist, maybe it does not).
The car does not allow for a trailer mount to put a bike rack on the back, the roof rack is hard to find (yes, Thule apparently makes it but I ordered one at REI over a month ago and I am still waiting). It looks nice in orange, though...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The car has 3000 miles on it, is great to drive, good on ice and snow. Unfortunately, we have to drive it on a short gravel road....a road which is graded regularly and well maintained. A small piece of gravel embedded in the tire and caused a slow leak. When the stone was removed....totally flat tire which I was told did not allow the car to be driven (my home is 40 miles from the nearest dealer). No replacement tire available for 3 days. No loaner cars available. Almost $600 for a new tire....$130 for car rental.
Perhaps this is an isolated event and there will be no additional tire problems. If not, there will be one very unhappy customer!

Over the last six months, I looked at and drove every available vehicle in its class, and the X1 is about as
good as it gets. It is solid, reliable, relatively economical, handles well, is quiet, and has enough room for a small family. It looks good and the build quality is impressive. Visibility is good for its class and it is loaded with enough technology to keep most people happy.
With the "save the planet" switch ( aka eco-pro ) turned off it accelerates to 60 mph in less than 6.5 seconds, and with it on, the fun factor drops but the mileage goes up. You get to pick!

My wife and I wanted a new vehicle that would be good on gas, fun to drive, 4 wheel drive, and have room for kids. This car meets all of the above. It has been great on gas for an SUV/SAV. When you drive the car you feel safe and solid. It is a pleasure to drive. The all-wheel drive system is awesome. We drove in the snow/ice and noticed no slippage of the wheels. Driving the same roads a few minutes later with my front wheel drive car I noticed a good amount of tire slippage. This car is built very well. The engine has plenty of power even though it is a 4 cylinder! The warranty is also another selling point for us. This vehicle is worth every penny!
