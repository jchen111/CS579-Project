As a previous owner of a 2002 & 2009 Avalon we were happy when we saw the new 2014 Avalon and bought one without doing much research.  We made a Great Big Mistake!  If you liked the ride of previous AvalonÂs you are in for a big disappointment.  The ride is terrible! Overall the car is beautiful and the amenities are great but the poor ride cancels all that out. You will feel every crack and bump in the road. Not as a gentle ride but as a big old thump.  Wish we would have taken the test drive on a rougher road before our purchase. We heard Toyota was trying to appeal to a younger market with new Avalon and it may appeal to them, but if you were a fan of the prior AvalonÂs do not purchase

I moved from a '08 ES 350 to the Avalon recently after deciding against the '14 ES350. In my eyes, the Avalon looks better from every angle and test driving it sold me. The car's comfortable, quiet, and has all the performance I'll ever need. I have Michelin tires, and while the ride is just a bit firmer than my old ES, I've found it to be comfortable over a variety of different pavements. The secure
responsive handling of this car more than offsets whatever small compromise in ride comfort was made. Again, early impressions, but I think it's a winner. One thing: I was surprised at how much darker the window tint on all but the windshield is. Compromises visibility, but I do have The BSM.
