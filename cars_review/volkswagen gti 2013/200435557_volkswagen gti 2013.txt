Had my 4-door GTI for 2 months & about 2k miles. What really puts this car over the edge are the little things that make you realize the designers put extra thought into the car: the front doors have three different stops, allowing you to open them at up to a 90 degree angle; the foot-wells are lit at night; the ambient lighting around the center console at night; there is fabric lining the cubbys in the doors and the glovebox; the red stitching throughout the cabin. In many cars, these extra touches aren't there and you don't miss them. But this car was designed for driving pleasure by car people, not by the bean counters. At around $25k, this car is a bargain.
