I've had my GTI for about 2 weeks now, and overall, I'm very impressed.
Plenty of power, good gas mileage, firm (but not punishing ride).
It feels very solid and well put together.
Seats are comfortable and supportive.
Just took it on an 800 mile trip, and it was a joy to drive.
I kind of wish I had gotten the manual, but with a long commute to work the DSG made more sense.
It shifts very quickly, and I've only noticed a very slight delay at launch.
Nothing major, as I've read on some other reviews.
The GPS graphics are a little cheesy, and the map data is very outdated, despite VW telling me I have the latest version in it. But it's easy to use and pretty quick with calculations.
