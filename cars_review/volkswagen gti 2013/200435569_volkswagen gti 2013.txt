Time came to replace a much loved Mazda RX8 with a vehicle my wife could be induced to drive in place of our SUV.
The RX8 was a delightful sports car but 17-19mpg around town and 20-22 mpg on the highway was no better than the SUV. And though "do-able" for two adults, an eight year old kid and big dog, it was hardly convenient. And for traffic a six speed manual could be torture (my wife says.) 

Considered a MINI and a TSX SportWagon but the MINI was too small (with 2 doors) and the TSX too long for the garage space. 

The GTI is perfect. Fun to drive. The DSG can match a very good MT. Solid, quiet, fast (and quick). For all but ski trips, it nearly equals the convenience of our Sorento.

I struggled with the decision of which car I would be buying.
I wanting something safe, practical (for my soon to be growing family) and fun to drive.
The GTI has exceeded all of my expectations.
I decided to purchase the DSG Autobahn model and it is stunning.
It is a smooth drive and has just enough "get-up" for me to navigate around Houston drivers.
My two golden retrievers fit in the back with the seats laid down
