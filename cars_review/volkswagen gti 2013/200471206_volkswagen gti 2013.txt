Update to my earlier review:
The issue turned out to be a faulty fuel pump and pressure regulator. The dealer removed and replaced both.
I have to say that both the dealer and VW corporate handled this very well. The "zone administrator" was significantly less helpful - so be aware. VW Corporate extended the terms of the warranty on my vehicle (full factory not aftermarket warranty, by my VIN) to 4yrs 48K miles. VW does stand behind their product! Since then over 8K trouble free miles in ~10 weeks. Very happy, happy, happy now!

Purchased brand new, great deal on price at $1050 under invoice. No cost tint and other extras. Sales process excellent. But am very disappointed. Took car out for first drive still using the "free" gas provided at delivery. After driving just over 100 miles out town in southern Arizona heat, the car stalled. Happened five times. Engine malfunction light came on steady amber. Four times the engine stalled in stop and go traffic. One time it turned itself off on the highway at 55mph! Car has 242 original miles on it. Got it back to the dealer where they are checking it out. Have to say that I do not trust this new car at all. So far, the dealer has been very responsive, will provide updates!
