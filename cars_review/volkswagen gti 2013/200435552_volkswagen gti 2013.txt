Had a Mark I for 12 years, base Mark VI for 3 and now this one. Switched from manual to auto and 2 door to four. Great car. Came from a string of BMWs (Z3, Z4, 3 series) and honestly prefer GTI. Especially in Autobahn form. Very Germanic. Solid, well crafted, highly competent. Excellent fuel mileage and very good performance. It's not a rocket and that's fine with me. I love the silence of the cockpit, the Dynaudio sound is great and the telematics work very well. I'm honestly surprised I like the DSG as much as I do, having been in a manual for 35 years. But it truly is a lot of fun, and when in bad traffic, great to have.
