I've had my 2013 GTI for nearly one year.
Love driving the car, performance, economy, styling, are all excellent.
 My car went in for a 10K Service at the Dealership and came away with a clean bill of health.
 Then 6 weeks later, the coolant light came on.
Dealership diagnosed as a fault with a new water pump part on 2013 models.
Significant work removing and reinstalling engine bay parts to repair.
While it was at dealership, they identified an additional fault - apparently through engine diagnostics - and it required a replacement intake manifold.
More engine bay parts removed and reinstalled.
I am now very concerned about the long-term reliability proposition for this vehicle.
