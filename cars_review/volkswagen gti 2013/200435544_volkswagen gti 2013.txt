Simply amazing car... the 2.0 Turbo is quick. It is strong all through the rev range, very little turbo lag.
I drive a considerable distance on the interstate, and it revs high at 75-80 mph (turning over 3000 rpm).
As such, I have to work to get 30 mpg out of it, although at 60 it gets mid-30's easy. It has an Audi-grade interior and fit/finish, love the plaid seats and they are very comfortable (and heated!).
The gauges light up white/grey/red and match the upholstory well.
This is the only car on the planet that I prefer the automatic over a stick; the DSG is brilliant!
My car also has the Pirelli tires as opposed to the Dunlops.
The GTI is a ball to drive, but civilized, too.
