I leased my 2014 GTI in February of 2014 and it has been nothing but problems since day 1. My heater did not work properly and my front tire was losing air about every 5 days from the day I purchased it. To make things worse the dealer wanted me to pay to fix so I had to contact customer care. They eventually did pay to have these fix but I have now had 3 more problems since, including having to put in a new water pump twice. I am tired of having to take my car into the dealer every month and this seems ridiculous to me for a car that is brand new. The reliability of this car is very poor and its sad that Volkswagen does not stand behind their vehicles. Customer service has been terrible.

Bought my base model manual GTI in April 2013 to use for work.
I drive all over the state of Texas visiting clients for my job and I have never been disappointed with this car.
Equally comfortable on the highway or in town.
Fast, excellent and communicative handling and brakes, great mileage, and big enough to carry all my work stuff.
I call on all types of automotive repair shops and parts suppliers and get a compliment on the car at least once a day no matter if they work on Chevys or Mercedes.
I went with United Gray to make it less conspicuous and have only gotten one ticket in the first 17,000 miles.
Love the car but am considering trading up to a Golf R when I hit 50K.
