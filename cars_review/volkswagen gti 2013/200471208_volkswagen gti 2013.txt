This car does everything well. Interior and exterior fit and finish are excellent. The car has plenty of power and delivers it uniformly with almost no turbo lag.
The gearbox shifts easily and quickly and clutch update is very smooth.
Handling is precise with just a bit of understeer which can be corrected with a little extra gas.
With 18" wheels, the ride is firm but not punishing.
I might consider switching to 17" wheels when it's time for new tires. Fuel economy matches the EPA estimate around town and it's easy to exceed the 31 MPG rating on the highway.
It's a pleasure to drive this car anywhere under any conditions.
