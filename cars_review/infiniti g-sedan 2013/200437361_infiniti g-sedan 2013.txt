I'v had the G37 sport sedan for a year now I have to say this car handles very well. It is a bit firm on the road and that's expected with the sport suspension. The 6 speed shifts are smooth but first gear is quicker then most 6 speeds I've driven. Power is quick and on tap. Navigation works well and the interface is easy and Infiniti did a great job of allowing voice, steering wheel control, dash control and touch screen on every component of the media and navigation for connivence. This is not a car you buy unless you plan on being at the pump. I mainly drive to work and back and the occasional windy road trip but not good for long trips with 17 mpg.

Once a very good car minus the gas mileage. I've had this car for 3 weeks and it averages 20.3 MPG. TERRIBLE! This is my second G Sedan since 2006 and that car got 25 MPG. compared to this one. What went wrong?? I think it's their 7 speed transmission. It shifts too many times and NOT smoothly. I drive on the highway 90% of the time. So, it SHOULD by about 26 MPG. Why spend $46,000 for a 2013 G37S?? when there ARE better cars (BMW, Lexus and Audi) out there.
