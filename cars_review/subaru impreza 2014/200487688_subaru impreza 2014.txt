I've owned my 2014 Impreza Limited for 6 months and 7K miles.  I bought it fully loaded with 900 miles on it (repossessed) from the dealer for $22,500.  Its a fun, tight drive with remarkable fuel efficiency.  I get 45 mpg at 55 mph, 40 at 65, and 36 at 70 with fwy driving.  Overall 36 fwy, 32 mixed and 28 city.  Efficiency drops noticeably when using the paddle shifters on country roads! Absolutely no problems so far, just lots of fun.
