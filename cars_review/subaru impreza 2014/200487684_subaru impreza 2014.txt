I've had my base model Impreza sedan for about six months now, and I have already put over 12000 miles on it.  This car was a fantastic value! I live in MN, so an AWD is essential.  It's no WRX, but the 2.0 with a five speed manual gets up to highway speed with ease.  I am averaging 34mpg with mixed driving.  Gets around 40 on the highway if you know how to drive properly.  I'm a fairly tall man, 6'5 and this thing has tons of head and leg room.  I check the oil with every fill-up, and it has not used a drop of oil.  I have the oil changed every 3500-4000 miles, even though i'm sure it would make it to 5k with no issues.  This is my first Subaru and it won't be my last!
