Nothing but problems. Kia difficult to deal with. 
Gas mileage is not as promised.
Gas gauge has too much float
Head unit quit working, been replaced
Wheel speed sensor almost killed me and a friend throwing my car into limp mode.
Ignition switch shorted out and had to be replaced.
Radio cutting out. Again.
Lights and wipers cut out.
Oh did I mention the horrible shake, hard shift, failure to downshift?

I had reservations about owning a Soul or any Kia for that matter.
I owned a Rio Cinco back when they first came to the US and hated it.
But I bought a 2010 model Soul and fell in love.
Unfortunately, I rolled it four times after having a seizure and totaled it.
I did break my back, neck and my foot, but considering what could have happened...I think the Soul saved my life.
Having to buy a new car, I knew exactly what I had to have...another Soul.
Having found a new 2013 model with only a few thousand miles I jumped at the chance.
I knew if I have another accident my life will be in good hands.
The power and pep it offers are remarkable considering what Kia started with years ago!

Ok so here is the deal at this point I have over 12000 miles on the car. I bought it in Jan 2013. I knew about some of the bad things like bad blind spot at the rear of the car and the MPG not so great but there are more bad starting to show up like the following: 1. It is noise like crazy when it rains you can hear the rain on top of the car. It sounds like you are in a tin can. 2. The road noise is bad with the windows down but even worse with them up. 3. The paint is starting to chip in some places. 4. The wippers leave a streak in the middle of the drivers side and KIA wont fix it and says the work fine. Bottom line dont get one

I bought 2013 white Kia Soul+
2.0L 6A for my wife, who is a teacher in my county school system.
Before, she had 2002 Honda Civic LX.

We initially looked into Honda CR-V or KIA Sportage.
In the end, she chose this one by sight.

We could have gone for 2014 model a month later, but she really liked the 2013 model design and size.

It drives very sturdy with that 2.0L engine.
It's loaded,with Antilock Brake System, Auto Traction Control System (On/Off controllable).... and 8 Airbags! 

Braking seems excellent.
The gas mileage is not good as I expected, but I've heard that it gets better with mileage. So I'm crossing my fingers.

I traded in a 2005 Honda Civic for the 2013 Kia Plus, and I am in love! It is exactly what I was looking for in a car - it's small, but spacious; the back seats fold down and offer a ton of room in the back. I am able to take my bike or my two yellow labs in the car with me no problem! It's got great response when I step on the gas, excellent brakes (and I love the brake assist). Also, mine came with an extra feature to turn on the car from outside, so I can warm it up in the mornings or start the AC, and it stays locked and running, and if someone tries to take it, it will automatically shut off without the keys. It's seriously WONDERFUL!

I've owned my 2012 Soul+ for a little over a year and have 17K miles on it and can't say enough about it.
I love the Infinity sound system upgrade I got and would highly recommend it.
It's pretty peppy which I like so I guess I can't complain too much about the fuel economy.


I'm a large person at 6'2" and 350 pounds and this is the most comfortable vehicle to get in and out of I've ever had.


I'm someone who loves to buy a new car every year (Sometimes even more frequently) but this car I will definitely be hanging on to for many years to come.

I don't see how you can beat this vehicles options and warranty for how cheap they are.
What a value!!

Believe me, if you decide on the 2.0 engine...think again unless you love putting out money for gas. When I fill the tank, it shows only a range of 250 miles. Iam constantly filling it up. Terrible terrible gas mileage. I love the car but I sure will be trading it in before too long due to the gas mileage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best bang for the buck.
The Soul was made for the young and the young at heart.
Entry and Exit is great for us that are starting to show our age.


The young drivers really take notice of my ride and always stop me and comment that they think it is super cool.

Just got this car 2wks ago.
During a rain storm I noticed condensation in front headlight.
When the sun came out it cleared up.
In order for it to be fixed, Kia has to examine it and they will not except the photo I took.
Posted this and pic on Kia Soul Facebook. Had several responses, they have the same problem and Kia told them this is normal for that car.
My 1st car hesitated at lights and turns. again several Soul owners said
Normal for this car.
I was proud to be a Soul owner, but not now. This is a small problem, and if my car was a couple years old it wouldn't bother me, but again this is a new car. And Kia won't do anything to satisfy a customer.
This is my 2nd Soul & last 1.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reason I rated this a "1" is because of the gas mileage. I have the 2011 Soul 2.0. I wanted more bells and whistles so I had to accept the larger engine. Terrible terrible terrible gas mileage. On a full tank, I only get a range of 259 miles at best. It sucks up the gas like as if youre driving a big ol Buick back in the day. I may consider another Soul when I trade this but deffinitely not the larger engine. Its just terrible
