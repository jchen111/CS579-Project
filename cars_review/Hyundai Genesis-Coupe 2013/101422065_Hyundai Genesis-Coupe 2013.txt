This is my third coupe (have owned a 2009, 2011 and now the 2013) and I must say this car is the best yet. Great power,very good built quality and comfortable. All the best things in the g37 for thousands less and with a great warranty to boot.I find the stereo to be fine (300 plus watts more then enough for me), the navigation works great as does the Bluetooth. If your looking fort a sports coupe that will leave some bucks in your bank account,then it is a no brainer.

This is one really impressive car. From nose to tail. I owned a 2008 Infiniti G37 Sport and this car is a very close second to it. In some ways better. The design is a real head turner. The interior is quite comfortable and spacious. The interior and exterior illumination is fantastic. The sound system could be vamped up a bit but still sounds good. The ride is decent. A little rough and the road noise can be loud but not overbearing. Compared to the G37 it feels way lighter. Most standard features are the same in both cars but the Genesis does have a little more. I lease this car and I'm excited to see how the Genesis Coupe progresses in the future. I'm extremely happy I picked this one.
