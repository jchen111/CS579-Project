rarely do i ever write reviews but i was so compelled to write one for the 2013 genesis 2.0t. i see a ton of mixed reviews at least for the 2.0t. The 2.0t is an extremely fun car for 25k. Power from the 4 banger is more than adequate if you're not an enthusiast or a tuner. Car receives a ton of looks, love the fact that it's not a common car on the road yet, it gives you a sense of exclusivity. Handling is good can take corners relatively well, but by no means is it on the same level as an FRS/BRZ. i see a lot of concerns and complaints about the waste gate on the turbo rattling, my genesis has about 2500 with no issue so far (knocks on every
piece of wood known to mankind) overall pleased

I purchased my 2013 Hyundai Genesis coupe two days ago and I absolutely love it. Naturally, you hear that this is a great value, and it indeed is! Lots of power, decent fuel economy, purrs when you drive it, and it turns a lot of heads. Even the base model is more than adequate in terms of interior styling and standard features. I put 300 miles in these two days of owning this vehicle, and so far, I have yet to have any complaints or concerns. I love this car!
