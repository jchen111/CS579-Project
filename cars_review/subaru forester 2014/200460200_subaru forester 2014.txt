I bought the car (2014 Subaru Forester 2.0XT Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo CVT)) on July 2013 after a lot of research and I am overall pleased. Acceleration is great in "S" mode but uses a lot of gas - average is 22.5mpg after 10,700 miles. Exterior design and 18" powder coated wheels are standout in the crowd of small size SUVs. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2014 Forester 2.0XT Touring is one of the nicest small SUV I have owned and could argue the best on the road today.
Just finished a 400 mile trip and averaged 30.9 MPG going 60 to over 70 MPH on 93 octane.
So far to and from work has been 27MPG.
The car is quiet, the Boxer engine is fantastic and very smooth with plenty of power for passing.
I did not think I would like the CVT but it is not so bad.
The S# mode has good simulated shifts. It is easy to see out of and feels very planted on the road.
I am not sure why others are complaining about MPG, I am getting better then EPA.
I think people are not paying attention to what mode (I, S, or S#) they are in. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Picked up
a 2014 FXT Touring in November 2013. Comfort is average but could be improved with power passenger seat. Gas mileage is a little better than my 2011 BMW 335xi 6MT, but only by 1-2 mpg- so around 22 city, 27 hwy.
Big problem is 1990's navigation system that was delivered with Q3 2012 maps while Q1 2013 maps were already availble from the Subaru website - for $149!!!.
Maps can't be downloaded to Macs, only PCs and require
SD card reader. Subaru said they'd reimburse me for the maps, but really? Why should a vehicle produced in 10/2013 have Q3 2012 maps? Why can't the dealer keep current SD cards
and why on earth would anyone pay Subaru and the wait? Can't wait to dump this hog.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have owned this car for two months. It is really fun to drive. I drove the2.5i Limited first but when I drove the 2.0 XT I fell in love with it. I have sacrificed gas mileage but the smooth power and increased handling capabilities sold me. Then the dealer offered me a trade in price for my car I could not pass up. I had a Mazda CX5 which was a good car but my wife had problems getting in that car and its visibility was not great. The Forester solved those problems. There is a solid high quality feeling with the Forester.
Each day I drive this car I feel the refinement of its build. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am 6'2" and fit perfectly, something that is hard to find.
My wife bought a Volvo SUV and I find getting in and out of the Subaru easier that doing the same in the Volvo.
The comfort level is exceptional, especially since I drive anywhere from 150-200 miles a day.
My mileage is also exceptional for this car, but the problem I do not like about it the fact that I have to use premium.
Sort of cuts down on the savings of the better mileage.
The care handles like a dream, has every bell and whistle you can get, which I am not used to yet, but will be shortly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The car is very responsive and easy to drive. The seats are comfortable and the rear seats have plenty of legroom. It feels very sporty for an SUV. Visibility is great -- the best out of any vehicles I have ever driven. I also test drove the CR-V and CX-5 and ultimately decided on the Forester for the power and handling and down right fun to drive factor. CR-V was boring .... CX-5 felt a little sluggish even with the latest engine, and it was harder to get in/out of due to high step in ... also back seats felt cramped.

The upgraded harmon kardon stereo sounds just ok .... blue tooth works well though, buttons are
small.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After test driving the following: CRV,CX-5, Q5,X3,Outlander,Escape, and RAV4, the forester completely won me over. I wanted something that could handle canadian winters but yet still be fun to drive. I am a young women and wanted something that was still ''cool''. I fell in love with the forester. It had the handling I required and all the bells and whistles (touch screen navigation, a sound system, the eyesight) that I wanted. It was completely fun to drive. I have a little over 580kms on it now and I still have 1/4 of a tank of gas left. She is all windows I don't think there is a blind spot in that car. I never thought I would own a Subaru but I couldn't be happier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All-weather package is the only feature of touring trim I found worthwhile. Navigation and infotainment systems are half-disabled when the car is moving. The CVT responds well in sport and sport# modes, but it's horrible in the "intelligent". So while the gas mileage is close to specs if I drive in the "intelligent" mode only, those numbers have little relevance in real life. Actual fuel efficiency is a lot worse - I get around 20 mpg on the average. Steering feels a bit artificial. The ride is quiet at constant speed, but gets very noisy with even modest acceleration. The cabin is reasonably comfortable except for an awkwardly positioned arm rest that I keep bumping into with my right elbow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2014 Forester XT w/ Eyesight system. Had put almost 2k miles on it already. Great so far...fuel economy is right on par with the EPA. The first two tanks of premium gas I was worried since it seamed to drink the gas, but after that was done, it improved drastically. Its possible to get over EPA with a controled foot...I had a hybrid so Im used to it. I was in between this and a CX-5 and the choice is made easier once you drive the XT...handles much better than the 2.5 IMO. CX-5 drives great but its rather small and hard to see out of. Forester feels bigger and more airy and the XT handles amazing, maybe even a bit better than the CX-5 since it feels much more planted to the road.

took delivery of my 2014 xt forester 3 days ago and already have 800 miles on it.
in general i am very happy with my purchase.
in broad strokes the 2013 forester is much prettier from the outside, but the interior of the 2014 is drastically improved.
the regular 2014 forester is much more attractive from the outside, than the xt.
that being said, i bought the xt for how it ran.
very well. very quick and smooth.
the xt can run on regular, but don't do it unless you have to b/c it will cost you more.
87 octane gets 19-22 city and 22-24 hwy.
93 octane gets 24-27 city and 28-31 hwy (hwy speed 68-78mph).
huge difference in mpg for a little more at the pump. do it.
so far, great car!!!
