Purchased certified used 2014 Limited 6 months ago.  MPG has solidly averaged 26mpg and on road trips I get 30-33mpg if I stay under 70.  
Prior Car: 2004 Volvo XC 70 
The Subaru had everything that is important to me - safety, visibility, quality, AWD, quiet ride, passenger space and few extras I wanted--awesome sunroof, heated seats, fog lights.  I am impressed with the handling.
Problems with competitors included awful cabin noise (RAV-4, CR-V, Equinox), cheap components (Compass, Equinox, CX-5), higher price for same features/quality (Escape, Volvo), terrible visibility (Venza), extra charge for AWD or 4WD that isn't as refined as Subaru, poor mpg (Volvo).  Forester had it all.

We have had our 2014 Forester for a year now and still love it. My wife hated the styling of all Subarus and refused to even test drive one until I tricked her into looking at the new Forester by telling her it was a Mitsubishi. She was pleased with the styling, amazed by how easy it was to drive (it's like driving an awd glass bubble with the turning radius of a jeep) and completely shocked when I informed her that she was in a Subaru. It has performed wonderfully even in the 10 inch snows we got repeatedly last winter and has been a joy to own. On top of that I frequently break 40mpg on trips and overall average 34mpg with 50/50 highway city driving.

Drive Car West Coast , Canada. Great car in Snow/Ice. SAFETY....Only SUV that passes the off-set Crash test...and
that alone is enough to buy this car after my recent ( non fault) Subaru write off crash.
Great Mileage! I get 32 us mpg on highway(over Mountain passes) and 34 us mpg on flat highways ; 25 us mpg in City...so I don't know why the Lead foot drivers complain of "poor" mileage.I had a CRV & Nissan and this car is
superior....and I would buy this SUV again and again.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's really hard to review this car without context of having driven its competitors.
To me it's a very nice vehicle but I'm not sure how it stacks up against other CUVs.
I'll try to address the major topics.
After 3900 miles it doesn't burn oil. MPG as advertised but drops with ambient temperature and speed over 65 mph.
I can drive a long way without getting lower back pain so I consider this comfortable.
Adequate storage where I can put a coffee in the center holder and water in the door (32 oz!).
Storage under cargo area for ratchet straps and wife's purse. Disappointed with stiff ride at first but used to it now. Radio data system intuitive and sound quality adequate.

Ok. we do drive a lot of miles(33,000) in 1 year. We have car serviced every 5000 miles at our local Subaru dealer with Subaru products. Each time of service I buy 2 extra quarts of oil this will keep it full until next service.I have complained they(dealer) tell me it's normal consumption.No leaks. It does drive and ride well just a pain to keep up with the engine oil.We bought this car brand new and we don't abuse it.This is info for anyone thinking of buying the 14 forester 2.5.We buy a new car every 3 years not sure if we'll buy another Subaru.

I have almost 4000 miles on my Forester Limited and from the day I brought it home the dashboard rattles and vibrates. I thought it was related to cold weather, but as the weather warms up it rattles worse. I have taken it into the dealership three times already and they tinker, pad and tighten with no improvement. I want to love this vehicle but it has eaten up and continues to eat up time and money in that I have to take off work and take it back to the dealer, only to have no improvement. The rattle seems to move but mainly in the vent or inside the odometer or MFD. Seems to be the whole dash. I am very disappointed. High rpms when accelerating, cheap carpet. Touchy gas pedal.

First week - The truck seems excellent.

Purchased in October. Was getting 29 mpg on average. The cold weather began in mid December and mileage waned. Now January, Polar Vortex in PA, and the mileage is down to no better than 21. Takes quite a while to warm up...that's ok, I have heated seats.
Defrost is ok, but it is just fogged windows I have to cope with - not the frost many of you spoke of. But I turn on the defrost or the heater and in auto, the air conditioner compressor is engaged to regulate the set temp. Can't turn it off. RPM goes up 500. OAT is 8 degrees. Don't need AC, just bring in outside air. Not smart engineering there. Is it because of the CVT, Mr. Engineer? Love the car otherwise.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have owned this Subaru (my first) for just three months and am baffled by all the wonderful reviews. The gas mileage is nowhere near what was advertised. Its ride is rough and bumpy on anything other than totally smooth roads. The car has so many interior rattles and clunking noises that it's impossible to enjoy a quiet drive through the countryside. Today, with typical cold winter temps, my driver's side door didn't open easily, the windshield wipers were still totally frozen after the defroster was running for a full 20 minutes and none of the power windows would open, even after another 20 minutes of driving with the heat at full blast. Am I supposed to wait until April for them to open?

My 3rd Subaru, but first Forester. Never bought before because it was too small.
 I am 6' tall, not huge, but this is the first Forester model I feel comfortable both in front and back.
My teenage boys are very comfy in the backseat, and they are my height.


My only complaint is the gas mileage.
I get 20-21 mpg when the local EPA MPG is 24.
That's a big difference, and I am not driving like a leadfoot !
I ease off on gas and coast to stop signs and red lights, and that's the only way I got close to 21mpg.
 My much larger outback gets about 19-20 locally, so only a 1 mpg improvement with a smaller Subaru.
