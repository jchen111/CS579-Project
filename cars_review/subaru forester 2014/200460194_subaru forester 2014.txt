I purchased a new 2014 Subaru Forester in July of 2013.
All work has been done at Maita Subaru of Sacramento I use the Synthetic 0-20 weight oil, Maita has performed all oil changes. I drive a lot so from July to now I have put 28000 miles on my car. Maita said that this engine burns oil and I should have to add about a quart between oil changes. They said that its the engine and its design so it gets better gas mileage. So now I have to bring back in every 1200 miles to check and see if it is burning more than usual, NOT a Happy Subaru owner!! 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have owned BMW (325i), Mercedes (C230), VW (Jetta, Convertible Beetle) Dodge Stratus and my college vehicle Chevy Chevette. 

I was looking at trading in my Mercedes for Lexus but since Lexus was closed, I drove by Subaru (Plano, TX) and thought I would take a look. I work in Electronics and have learned that Japanese take great pride in quality, so I while I had checked out every major car mfg, I was am so glad I walked into the lot. The only one they had left was a blue 2014. I love the sunroof, makes it fun, but with the upgraded wood added, I also feel like driving luxury vehicle. 9 months and I love this vehicle!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like this vehicle a lot, when the weather is warm. I started having issues at about 1,200 miles. When the weather is cold, is chugs, almost like the engine is missing, but there are no engine lights and the tach doesn't show any problems. Transmission? Doesn't seem to change even after the vehicle warms up.
When the weather is not cold, runs great.
Took it in to dealer but they think I'm just not used to CVT.
Downshift seems to drag a bit.
Gas mileage is good. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have owned our Forester for a little over three months and put on about 3,500 miles.
I thought I would try and give some insights that might not be apparent on a one hour test drive.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love most aspects of the 2014 Subaru Forester but one of the key elements which influenced my decision to purchase this vehicle was the advertised 8.3 liter per 100 km gas mileage.
Currently, I am averaging 13.6 liters per 100 km or 16 mpg.
city driving.
Not impressed and will put a For Sale sign on this vehicle if this hasn't improved significantly in the next 6 months.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have a 2102 which so far has been bulletproof, and the 2014 is a huge improvement.
Much better handling, peppier, and much better fuel mileage than the 2012.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an update review after driving the car 2500 miles.
I will keep it short and sweet.

- I have noticed that it is somewhat hard to achieve the advertised city MPG but I attribute that to the fact that I am not a grandma driver. I actually use the gas pedal.

- Highway MPG is great, even at 75MPH you can get 28-29 MPG. Keep in mind that the 32MPG advertised is achieved at 55-60 MPH.
The drag coefficient goes way up once you pass 65 MPH.

- I have had no problems and I am overall in love with my vehicle and the AWD system. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After what seemed like years looking for the right car, I bought the new 2014 Forester for my wife.
The Consumer Reports review tipped it for me.
We've had it about a month and a half now, with about 3500 miles.
All the things said about it are true - good gas mileage, comfortable seats, easy access, nice handling and great visability.
As reported, the ride is a little jittery, but it's nothing bothersome.
 We took it around the Mountain Loop Highway out of Granite Falls, WA.
The highway has 25 miles of unpaved, often washer board road, and here the Forester shined.
It handled incredibly well and smoothed out the washer boards with a smooth controlled ride.
Can't wait for winter.

Over this ast few years I've owned an Audi A4, a Prius, a Mini Cooper S, a VW GTI, and a Chevy Cruze Eco. All were good cars but each had characteristics I didn't care for right from day 1. Not the case with my new Forester. I haven't found a single thing I don't like about this car (well okay, I didn't like the wheel rims so I replaced them with some I do like - but that's it). This 2.5i is the bottom of the line Forester, but it has everything I would ever want in a car, including cruise control, which, on other cars I looked at was available only on the upscale models.
Oh, by the way, this color, this eggshell metallic white, was a thousand dollar option on my 2000 Audi.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my first Subaru and my first AWD vehicle.
I have driven other AWD cars before from Ford on test drives but nothing beats Subaru's AWD system.There are youtube videos showing why this is and why their system is head and shoulders better than other's.

-Gas Mileage: I will report back on this again after more miles are put on it.
But right now driving around the city running errands I average 26.7 MPG.
Well within the advertised range.

-Powertrain: I am shocked at how fast this vehicle accelerates off the line. Because of the CVT transmission it is able to perform like V6 powered cars I have owned in the past. Plenty of power.
Much more than our 2010 Chevy Equinox.
