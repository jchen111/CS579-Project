I have owned 7 subarus now, 2 brought new and my 2012 Forester brought new is a disappointment.  Have had all services done with Subaru, it uses excessive amounts of oil, and dealer / Subaru said this was acceptable and did not want to fix it, despite so many people reporting similar problems.  In the end after continual protestations on my part, after a year of oil consumption tests (inconvenient) and with me having to be very assertive in articulating my complaint, they eventually have just now replaced the piston rings under warranty, a complete pull down of engine.  Just because of the way I have been treated, I would not recommend to buy one.
