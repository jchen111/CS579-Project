We bought this SUV in July 2013 and now have 6,600 miles on it, using it only in summers at our cabin in Vermont and storing it all winter. We average 27 mpg in Green Mountain driving, get up to 31 mpg. The Forester rides and handles well. Alleged noise from engine, CVT and road is actually no problem. Visibility is unparalleled. Cargo capacity is enormous. If anything, the car is a bit too big for my preference; it's truck-sized. But, in a Subaru plus, controls are simple. (We have no nav, since we tend to know where we are, or excessive infotainment nonsense.) Consumer Reports ranked the Forester tops in class, and we can endorse that. I'd buy another.

Originally fog light out and intermittent cruise. I could take the key out and the car would roll away, gas gauge range not accurate I have run out twice range said 70 miles no low fuel light. Okay so they got the kinks out and I like it.
I have a 2012 forester premium and a 2014 premium. I like the gas mileage and find it plenty comfy plenty of pep. I commute over 100 miles a day round trip. I was very disappointed with a lowball $19,200 trade offer when I was having problems with it paid like $26 to $27 I forget a few nice options

Safety, visibility, AWD and transmission.
These are 4 things which aren't very sexy, but oh my goodness do I love them!
Safety features are things which I rely on the IIHS and NHTSA to tell me if they are good or not.

The visibility and transmission for this car is amazing.
I commend the company for not going for sacrificing practicality in the name of design.
The windows improves my mood so much! I absolutely love driving this car and being able to see the sky and everything around me!

The transmission is also extremely responsive.

The AWD is also awesome! performed wonderfully last winter.

 Probably the worst car I have owned because competition has made big improvements and this Subaru lags behind now. Foresters were never modern but they had personality. The 2014 does not. I bought a Premium 2.5i because that's a limit I am willing to pay for a Forester. Any more and I can buy a Highlander or a 4runner.

Ride is ok but bouncy and jittery on bad roads. Steering has poor feedback and handling is scary at 80mph+.
Holding the steering wheel feels like driving an economy $12k car. Just poor quality plastics - I advise to get the leather wrapped steering wheel as an option.

In 20 deg weather (dry) I could not roll down windows and first opening doors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After 13,700 miles on my 2014 2.5i Premium with CVT, I have decided my purchase was a big mistake. I kept trying to "get used to" the annoying characteristics of this drivetrain, which include an overly sensitive pedal response, producing a constant "rubber band effect" in city traffic and over revving on the road when passing.
I have grown to hate it so much I am avoiding driving it.
The gutless engine makes a lot of noise when pushed, but noise does not make it go fast.
Additionally, the CVT bucked and jumped when cold for the first 5,000 or so miles of use, and the dealer had no explanation or fix.
Not the worst car I have bought, it's close.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've had my car for 2 weeks and I absolutely love it!
It is definitely a practical buy, so people looking for prestige/performance should look elsewhere. mpg is great, I am getting 28-30 in the first few hundred miles, even though I am mostly in 20-30mph traffic during most of my commute.
 I recently drove through a major snowstorm in the northeast and this thing performed wonderfully!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've driven a 2006 Forester until now which I loved, but unfortunately hit a deer (great crash test results, however!)
This one has some pros:
roomy, great views, love the CVT, peppy, nice radio, but:
This car has the worst ride of any vehicle I've ever driven.
I don't know how they passed this new suspension.
If you have back problems or kidney problems, this is not your vehicle.
You will feel every tiny bump in the road.
Other reviewers have called the ride 'skittish', 'unsettled', 'jittery', 'tiresome and annoying'.
I agree with all of those.
It is a very hard ride, very jarring - constantly bumping and jostling, while at the same time rocking side to side.
It's a shame because

Now that I've had my Forester long enough to be well acquainted, I thought I would leave an update. So far I'm impressed with the overall performance, ride, quality and features. I'm averaging just over 30mpg in 80/20 highway driving and I am quite impressed by the performance of the CVT transmission -- and I was always a manual transmission driver before this.

It's no sports car (like my old Impreza), but it is generally comfortable, smooth-riding, relatively quiet and it handles pretty well for the SUV that it is. It's an excellent family-sized vehicle and a great value.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll be honest in saying that this is first new car I have owned and the most luxurious, but I have ridden in nicer cars owned by others.
I have owned a Subaru previously (1987 GL 3-door hatchback, 4-speed manual).
I just sold it last year, but I have been longing to own a newer Subaru for many years.
For the price, this car is unbeatable!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I purchased this car in August.
I had a 2010 Forester and loved it.
When the new Foresters came out with the improved gas mileage, I bought one.
I absolutely loved this car until November when winter hit.
Mine won't defrost the windows or the windshield wipers properly.
It doesn't heat up the interior of the car.
The power windows freeze, and the cool engine light comes on after letting the car warm up and driving it for several miles.
Due to the engine running so cold, my gas mileage has almost cut in half during these cold winter months. I have 7000 miles on it, but living in the North, can't keep it.
I'm extremely disappointed.
