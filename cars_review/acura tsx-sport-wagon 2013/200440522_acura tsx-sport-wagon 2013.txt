Just traded in my 2011 TSX Sport Wagon for a 2013 TSX Sport Wagon Tech in Graphite Luster Pearl.
Once I found out Acura would no longer be making this car after 2013, I went out and got myself another one.
I almost had it 2 years and 42K Miles.
I have had many cars, but never the same one! I have 2 dogs (lab and golden) and they fit just fine.
Great Gas Mileage - 27MPG regular commute.
34 MPG on long trips.
Love it - A shame it never got the advertisement it deserved.
