I bought my veloster turbo a couple of months ago and thought it was time for a review.  I have never been disappointed in this car and I love the way it drives.  I average about 34mpg combined! And I still have enough power to accelerate and pass when I need to.  The sound system is pretty good especially on xm radio.  There is plenty of trunk space, especially with the back seats down.  Everyone looks at my car as I roll by and I have not seen another veloster turbo in nor cal since I have bought it.  I love that this car is really uncommon.  From a stop, the car will pull you back into the seat as you race the engine!  If youre looking for an economical car with some power, this is it!
