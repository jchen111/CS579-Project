There is a difference between a cheap car and an inexpensive car. This Honda is just plain cheap!
And what is worse, the Honda service groups at the dealer have a take no prisoner approach to dealing with the customers.
You sell these cheap cars and then treat the customers like they are wealthy people and money is of no concern. The dealer tried to do things like $100.00 to change a cabin air filter (I found one on the internet for $9.80 and it was easy to change)... and I can give a dozen other examples.
The air conditioner has a design flaw with the condenser being easily damaged, and the list goes on and on.

This is a good car for anyone wanting a wagon-type car with better-than-wagon mpg. This is my commute car, so it does a good job of handling both freeway and city streets quite well. I also did test drives on the Kia Rio5, the Kia Soul, the Ford Fiesta, the Hyundai Accent, and the Nissan Cube, but the Honda Fit was a better overall experience.
