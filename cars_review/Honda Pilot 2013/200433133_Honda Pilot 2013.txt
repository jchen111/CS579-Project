There is a problem when the car goes into ECO mode.
The dealer told me it was normal and that I must be over sensitive to vibration & sound.
It feels like a "hesitation" or "stutter" and is NOT normal! *sigh*
I love everything else about my Pilot, but am sad to say I'm currently looking to trade it due to this issue.

We recently purchased our New Honda Pilot at Commonwealth Motors in Haverhill,MA. Our sales person was Gary Kotyla, he was very helpful and thorough going over all the details of the purchase and all we needed to know about our new Pilot.
This is our second Pilot that we have purchased from Commonwealth Motors and we are very happy!
