This is my second Legacy that I have leased and I made a mistake not purchasing the 2011 at the end of the lease. I really loved that legacy. Now I have the 2014 legacy sport and I can not get past the poor ride. On smooth roads you can enjoy the car, but any road that has bumps or cracks is felt. I thought it might be the 18 inch tires or that maybe needed to get broke in a little. I have 13,500 miles on it and no such luck. This is my third Subaru that I have leased, but I am so unhappy with the ride that I will not be leasing from Subaru again.
