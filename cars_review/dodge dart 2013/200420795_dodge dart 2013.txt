Purchased July19th, 2014 (yes, was new and "lost" on the inventory at dealership).  Had 100 miles on odometer, at 500 miles, transmission would not engage in turning lane, hobbled home, Tow #1(reflashed ECU).  At 1100 miles, transmission would not engage and could not back out of garage, Tow #2, (replaced shifting pistons/actuator assembly).  At 1655, transmission would not engage after stopping for coffee, Tow #3(found corroded ground terminals).  At 1950, trans would not engage, Tow #4 (now replacing transmission). California has Lemon Law, I am using it...too bad. So towed 4 times before first car payment!

Purchased my car on June 7th, on June 30th with only 1400 miles driven the car began to misfire in the #2 cylinder and check engine light was on. Took car back to the dealer, it took a week for Chrysler to tell them to change a spark plug.
Changed the spark plug and the car was still misfiring.
Now they are waiting for a new fuel injector.
They really have no idea what is wrong with the car. When the car works properly it does get good gas mileage.
Love the collision avoidance system, the easy to read touch screen, and clear back-up camera.
But I am afraid after reading all the problems other owners have had this car will only be a problem.

Car bought Dec. 2013- 13k miles..This car has been 1 problem after the other from 3 recalls to 3 times in the shop due to the service transmission and engine light comes up.
The first time the dealer couldn't duplicate the issue.. I drove for a few weeks second time it happened again they had to replace one of the electrical panels. Then the third incident I was on the highway in traffic the car wouldn't move. I had to shut it down and inch my way off to the side to get a towed to dealer and now they have no clue since they cant "duplicate" the issue. Chrysler must be waiting for a serious law suit because I am not the only one with the issue.. just cant wait until my lease is up!

I have had the car for a year now and have out over 27,000 miles on it.
At 15K the transmission stopped working.
Took it to the shop and they fixed it. At 16K the transmission quit again.
Again the fixed it. No problems with the tranny since but the shifting is not as smooth.
At 20K the centre console went black. Car ran drove fine but could not change anything, which was not fun since the defrosters were on HI.
They reset the module and it has been fine since. Overall I really like the car but I think there are going to be a lot of problems with it.
Thank goodness I bought the lifetime warranty on it, I think i'm gonna need it.

I have 27,000 miles on the car and the engine is being replaced.
The engine light came on for no reason and the dealer couldn't find anything wrong with it. Shifting is the worse.
I thought it would settle in, but sometimes you don't even know the gear you are about to shift into.
You get lost.
I can't put a regular car mat down on the driver side because the shift pedal catches the mat.
The service departments are really there to go above and
beyond the normal problems.
They have had my car for on month and want me to pay 10 days or more on a rental, while I'm payinng the car note and insurance on a car I can't drive because they are so slow in fixing it.
Customer Care gets no where

This car is a joy to drive. The interior is amazingly comfortable and comes loaded with great tech. Performance is great and overall the driving experience very fun. We actually have the 2.4 Liter engine with the 6 speed automatic transmission.

I have the Dart Limited with a 1.4L Turbo Engine, Manual Transmission. Overall the quality of this car is very good both inside and out. Some road noise at higher speeds, but the ride is smooth. Touch screen & GPS are great, it even finds lowest gas prices in the area.
OK gas mileage, I currently get 29city/35highway. That is less than other cars in this class. Used both regular gas and plus, not much difference. And if you have the A/C on you lose even more mpg & the engine gets REALLY bogged down, like towing a boat.
Manual transmission is OK, 1st & 2nd gear are a bit rough and 3-6 are fine. Clutch was sticking to the floor, dealer says nothing wrong with it.

I've had my Dart about a month now (Limited model with 1.4L Turbo and DDCT Transmission), and I couldn't b happier.
What a steller small car.
I haven't been able to get the mileage to approach the highway rating yet, but it seem sto be slowly creeping up. It definately pays to put premium in the car (it's recommended) and keep the A/C off when possible.

I love the DDCT now that I'm used to it.
Remember, it's an automated manual, NOT and automatic.
For those of us that have driven plenty of manuals, we know what that means and should be used to the way this transmission behaves.
It's smooth and very direct, as long as you don't hammer it like a maniac.
It's tuned for smoothness.

I have had this car for a month and love everything about it. Interior is beautiful and very nice for the price class it is in. I am averaging 38.2 miles per gallon (calculated manually)driving mostly hwy at 72 mph. I am very pleased with the vehicle and hope it lasts.

Purchased a new 2013 Dodge Dart.
Within 2 weeks of owning the car the lower control arm bolt either broke or was never tightened.
My steering locked up on me while driving the car.
In all attempts to talk with Chrysler, they refused to take responsibility.
This was the 7th and final car that we will buy due to their lack of responsibility or loyalty to my family and the danger that they put us in.
