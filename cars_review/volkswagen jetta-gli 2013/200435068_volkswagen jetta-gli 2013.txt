Overall a great car w/over 4k miles! Downgrading from a Maxima I expected much less. I'm consistently getting 29-31 MPG on the highway. Awesome turbo-engine that makes a killer growling noise! Telematics is the best I've seen,..very sporty look inside & out! nice build quality is apparent upfront. BT/touchscreen radio is very good to not be the "premium" option. Love the red stitched seats and black bucket seats and you should know the AC blows really cold!! Nice chrome double-tipped exhaust.
