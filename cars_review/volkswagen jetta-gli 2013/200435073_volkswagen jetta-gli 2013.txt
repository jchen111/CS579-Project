I have about 1k miles on my 2013 Jetta GLI and I am really enjoying this car. You can definitely feel the quality in this car when driving it, and it has plenty of room for an adult or car seat in the back. While you won't be blown away with power, it is still a quick car that packs enough punch for easy highway passing. One of the most addicting things about the car for me, is the great noise that comes from the turbo even at very low RPMs (1500ish). Overall, there is nothing that is superior to it's competitors, but it does everything very, very well.
