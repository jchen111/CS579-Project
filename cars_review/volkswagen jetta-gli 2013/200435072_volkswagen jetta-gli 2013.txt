Only 1000 miles the car, but so far very fun, comfortable and gets lots of looks.
Navigation
leaves a little to be desired, but all controls are simple to use and laid out very well.
Getting about 28 mpg all around on semi spirited driving.
Great on the highway, but watch those potholes with the low profile tires.
I was very close to getting a Kia Optima SX-L, but the GLI cost less, was less to insure had a larger trunk and back seat, and had free scheduled maintenance.
Hope my time with the car stays positive

I have a 2013 Gli Autobahn W/Nav my only complaint is the small screen but other then that the car comes with so many little toys for under 30k. Its very fun to drive and gets alooooot of attention, it turns heads. The tires that come with the car are HORRIBLE though. Wow really bad, no grip. The cars Leatherrette is very comftrable and the seats do hug you, the steering wheel is very awesome. I have a 2011 Porshce 911 turbo and the noise this little 2.0 tsi makes is comparible and AMAZING. It sounds like a baby AMG with a little porsche turbo/vtech TSSSS. Very good commuter car, I went to the dealer and drove everything they had this car just stood out i HAD TO BUY IT. Its Fantastic

After about a thousand miles on the GLI, I thought I would write a quick review. I'll start by saying that I test-drove most small to midsized cars and this was my absolute favorite of the bunch. 

The car is fun to drive. The handling and little turbo engine really go well together.

In addition, it comes completely loaded for under $30k (after a little negotiating).

The ride is a little stiff compared to other jettas, but the sport suspension will do that.

Also, I am about 6'6'' and can very comfortably drive this car.

Love the car.
