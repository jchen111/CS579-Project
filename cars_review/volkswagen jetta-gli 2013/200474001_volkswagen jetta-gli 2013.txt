This is my thirteenth car ranging from an E-class to Suzuki Sidekick. With 1000 miles on my car to date, this is a great blend of fun, business and comfort. I need something able to accommodate 4 adults comfortable for work at times, capable of being fast and agile, and relaxing when I want to chill out. It offers all of that. The nav system could be better if it offered traffic alerts, but with all other amenities, I can live without it. For those who say it is not fast, I would recommend trying the manual. I have no issues at all with great German handling and speed in all gears.
