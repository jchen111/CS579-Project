the GLI doesnt do anything absolutely perfect in its class,
but in my opinion, is best in class in terms of overall value.
the engine, 6spd manual and interior are all fantastic.
the exterior is above average and now with the LED lights, it looks good in my book.
Exterior could be slightly more aggressive, but not a deal breaker.
has plenty of room in back seat as well, and great trunk.
the practicality of this car is so good its silly.
if you are the kind of person that recognizes cars in this class will never be raced at a track, the balance of engine and chasis is perfect for day to day roads (with lots of potholes...).
