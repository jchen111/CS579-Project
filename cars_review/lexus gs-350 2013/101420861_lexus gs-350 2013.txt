Have owned 2013 GS350 AWD for two months and really enjoy driving the car. I drove Infiniti Q50, G37x, M37, Hyundai Genesis, and BMW 335 and picked the GS. It had a solid ride and quality unmatched by the others.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested BMW 535XI, E350 Benz, Jaguar XF, Acura TL and after nearly buying the E350 Benz, landed on the 2013 Lexus GS.
The moment I sat down in the drivers seat, after trying all of those other models, I was going to own the GS.
The technology, comfort, screen size and logic before I even put it in to drive were amazing.
Once I took it out on the highway, I felt like I owned the road as it hugged the lane and I hardly had to touch the steering, but when I did, my god!
I still haven't found out where the limit is on cornering speed is.
I am getting a solid 27mpg with mostly highway driving as I commute 50 miles each way.
I couldn't imagine owning any other car...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About me:
I tried AudiA6, BMW5S and MB
 Main use commuting to work.
I now own the 2013 GS 350F AWD

Once I sit in the car and the seat positions around me like a mold I feel like Im commuting in a perfect mix between a Race car/Millenium Falcon.
The car is responsive in the normal mode and more aggressive going into the S+ mode.
There is something for everyone in this car.
If I feel aggressive in driving there is a button for that S+.
To me its the perfect combination of comfort, sport and modern technology.
It feels complete.
Even balance bet HP and MPG is just right.
A few xtra horses would be nice but prob wasted on most of us. 
Lexus Service - PERFECT, others not even close.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyone who drives this car while shopping among the A6s, 535XI, M37, trust me, you'll pick the Lexus. You must get AWD F Sport version. It's silky smooth on the highway and blows by other cars with ease or, slip into Sport S+ mode and drive is tight, handling precise, grip is secure, and engine sounds and performs, in a word, awesome. I traded in my '07 GS350 AWD and I didn't think I would get another but F Sport is a much more aggressive, yet refined car.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had a new GS-350 as a company car.
It's very...uh, nice, I guess.
The handling is mushy and imprecise.
The drivetrain is about as responsive as a defensive tackle.
It has all the creature comforts you would expect from a Lexus.
However, the stereo is lousy - whoever Mark Levinson is, he's stealing money from Lexus by getting paid to put his name on the premium sound system.
All in all, it's a car that will make you feel older than you are.
I didn't realize how little fun it is to drive until I quit my job and bought an Acura TL - now THAT's a driver's car.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GS350 F-Sport is, in reality, the best "5-Series" ever built. It is very tight, has precise weighted steering, and handles like a BMW--or even better-- in every way. It is the ultimate sports luxury sedan...but you need to get the F-Sport version and drive it in Sport+ mode (the most aggressive mode), which decrease gas milage somewhat.
However, unlike the 5-series, the GS350 has the interior quality and fine leather of a $100K+ car (I'm not exaggerating--especially with the cabernet interior), and the build quality and long-term reliability and service that BMW or Audi can't match.

Btw, I've been been driving German sports sedans for years, and this Lexus beats them all.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I replaced my Audi A6 2010 with this car mostly for Lexus' reputation for reliability. I loved driving the Audi but it had too many maintenance issues. In terms of driving feel and design the lexus is good but not as good as Audi IMHO. Had the car for 2 months so far and hoping no maintenance issues come up in the future. I commute about 25 miles per day in mixed highway city and am averaging 18-19 mpg. No appreciable difference when using econ mode. This reviews probably sounds negative but I do like the car alot - just a little peeved by the small issues.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For middle management guys like me, who go for cars like this, you've to stop lying to yourself. I'd love to say max power, max torque and racing handling are my top priorities. They're not though, they can't be. Reliability and comfort have to occupy some top spots. Before I enjoy the daily adrenalin shot that I get from my 2013 GS350 F-Sport, it had better start, emmerse my senses and not leave me in a cloud of steam on the side of the road somewhere. I promise you that this car can handle everything and anything that you're going to want to do in the real world. Your bravery will run out and your consideration for not crossing from spirited to reckless driving will kick in well below the limits of the F-Sport. Great track day car? No. But I'm going to work a lot more often then going to the track. I just want to enjoy the hell out of the daily commute and dude, it just doesn't get any better in this price range. This car makes me feel alive, proud, motivated. I can see it from my 5th floor corner office and it calls to me all day long. I can't wait to drive it and I get a goofy smile every time I get in. Ignore the track teleme-trickery and get the car that soothes your brow as well as it lights your fire. When you click into Sport + mode, this car will strain at the leash and bark out a multi-stage exhaust note that is 100% primal scream. When your talent runs out, it will make the decisions that you failed to, and ensure that you live to tell the tale to your dude-bro's AND get your daughter to her volleyball game on time. I promise, you will not be disappointed in this work of engineering excellence.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have had the GS350 F Sport for over 5 months. I wanted something relaible and sporty. I had 2003 G35 2 door 6 speed manual rear wheel drive
for 9 years since it came out. I had kids so I needed more room. At first wasnt crazy about the front grill but I compared it to the C350, BMW 5's and Audi 6 's series cars . The lexus interior was the best - I have the meatallic finish with the F sport. What sold me on the car was the test drive - after the drive the handling, braking, agility was far superior to that of Audi,BMW or Benz. I am still finding all sorts of gadgets and surprises even after 5 months. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've had my AWD GS for about 3000 miles and what a fun car. I have the luxury package build with Mark Lev and the sound system and infotainment are amazing. The black wood and semi-aniline leather are so rich. The Sport mode is awesome, really takes the driving experience to e next level. I traded my '10 5 series and good riddance! I went back to the Lexus dealer to put some air in my tires and car wash and service treatment is far superior. I cant believe I put up with bmw as long as I did.
