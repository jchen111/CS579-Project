The Taurus wasn't on my list, but I gave it a test drive while shopping for a quiet, smooth car. At the time, I was considering the new Fusion.

I'd driven the Taurus in 2010, and I was quite surprised by how much nicer it has gotten.
Ford refreshed the design in 2013, and paid close attention to NVH concerns. Because the front seats are a little confining for a car this size, they even added softer surfaces around the driver.

I would never pay sticker for any car, but the Taurus is a value with $7000 in manufacturer and dealer discounts.

Be careful which tires you get. I found that the optional 20" tires really hurt ride quality.
The 18s and 19s produce a posh ride, though.

I have read good and bad reviews on here. First, to clear things up, I am 5'4" and my husband is 6'6".
We both fit into the vehicle just fine, he prefers to be in his truck, but said that in any car, this one still gives him head room.
 The styling inside and out is what drew us to this car, Ford needed to step it up on their vehicles other than their trucks and Mustangs.
The sync, my touch, and my key has not given us any problems so far, (23,000 miles) They all take getting used to, but ford has very good videos on how to use them if you are unsure.
It has plenty of back seat room for two teens, and if you need more room, you should upgrade to a limo.

I purchased a new 2013 Ford Taurus Limited that had all the bells and whistles at over $40K. I wanted a large sedan and thought the new Taurus would suffice my needs. I know I jumped the gun on my purchase with this Taurus. When I test drove the Taurus is was on smooth roads in the day. The Taurus had a horrid, buckboard ride on uneven pavement, the seats Ford uses now are simply horrible, the Taurus' halogen headlights are the worst in the industry! I also found the interior to be small for such a big car. It had a roomy truck though. The center console is ridiculous and the ergonomics are pretty terrible. Car has squeaks and rattles and the headliner is bubbling. Car is now for sale.

The ride is smooth and very little road noise.
Kids have plenty of room in the back.
No complaints with front seat room either.
I do not think it is confining.
Have had no trouble with Sync and love that I can talk on the phone without having to take both hands off the wheel.
Only downside is it does not have much get up and go.
Does not break very well either on snowy/icy roads.
So far I am very happy with this car.

Wonderful car.
I just traded in my 2012 Ford Focus SEL on a dealer
demo 2013 Ford Taurus Limited.
Sticker price was 39,900 and I picked it up for 30,800.
It had almost all of the options including the 20" chrome wheels, the massaging seats, and just about everything else you could think of.
I absolutely love everything about this car.
Yes, I have read all of the reviews about it being outdated, small interior, ect... but personally I just love the looks and feel of this car.
I have owned a couple of corvettes, mustangs, and other sport cars, but now that I am older with 2 kids, I needed a larger car.
This car has plenty of power, is very luxurious, and is fun to drive.

Beautiful full size car. Very quiet. Very smooth. Very comfortable. Love to drive it. Quick. Tranny is like silk. Getting 24mpg in mix of driving. At 60 MPH the tach is at only 1500. Lots of features. AC seats in North Texas are a blessing. Bought used with only 16,000 miles for a bargain price, what some other used 2011s with more miles were going for.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After 1 day and 36 miles we have experienced 5 dropped calls in this period of time.4
Local calls 1 out of state. We've read about this re-ocurring problem with others and will 
be all over our dealership for it. I have purposely purchased an American Made auto to be a good citizen and strngthen our economy......now
we'll see if the American Auto industry is truly 
out of the dark ages of poor quality. Will keep posting until issues are fixed.

I've owned my 2013 Ford Taurus Limited for over a year. I am totally satisfied owning and driving this outstanding vehicle. I love the wide track stance (3 inches wider front and back than the Buick Lacrosse and Impala). The car is so quiet yet Motor Trend has a 0-60MPH in 6.6 seconds! It's fast and its not a SHO! Ford has a winner in the Taurus . My daughter has a 2010 Taurus and loves it. My neighbor also bought a 2012 and raves about it. I am keeping this beauty for a long time. The ride, comfort and reliability from Ford on this car is outstanding. Made in Chicago by an AMERICAN COMPANY!

The 2013 Taurus improves on an already excellent fullsized sedan from Ford. When I drove the Focus, Fusion, and Taurus back to back, several key points became clearly evident: 
1) The Taurus is the quietest and most refined of the three; 
2) the Taurus has the most interior space and sits the highest, providing an excellent view of the road ahead; 
3) the Taurus has the highest build quality and feels exceptionally premium; 
4) the Taurus is the heaviest and least fun to drive of the three;
5) the Taurus has the most limited visibility of the three. 

With this in mind, I recommend the Taurus only if the driver finds the visibility acceptable in parking and driving maneuvers, as I did.

We discovered the new Taurus through renting it first.
We did not even realize the car was a Taurus because it was nothing like previous versions.
We ended up renting it again for another trip and decided this was the car we would purchase after doing some research with other comparable cars.
The 2013 Taurus really just feels like a complete luxury vehicle.
This is the first American car we purchased in over twenty years.
Every detail speaks to quality and design.
For example the dashboard is not only very functional but extremely appealing aesthetically.
