Bought a new Taurus and from day one the sunroof had a lot of wind noise. Dealer said it was normal. First rain, and it leaked, dealer said they all leak a little. Finally put a new one in and it was fixed. Automatic door locking is nice but when a spring popped out and sprang across to the passenger seat, I know this was a trashy car.
Terrible blind spots, NOISY as heck on the highway...sounded line the wheel bearings were bad or dry, MySync was AWFUL, and I could go on and on. So I traded it for a new Chrysler 300. Absolutely gorgeous, and not one complaint.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like the car in general, but as far as quality its junk!!
This thing has been in the shop on and off since day one, it has vibrations in the drive terrain, clunks in the seat, and squealing under the hood , and the my touch, sync stuff is total junk!
phone disconnects and screens do screwed up stuff all the time..
I have heard ford is having alot of problems with the sync and my touch system.
Now my car is going in on wed to be completly gutted on the interior, to try and find this clunk they are unable to fix, just what i want is a brand new car that has been all tore apart!!
And they wont willingly take it back, but very soon there will be a lawyer involved!!!!
