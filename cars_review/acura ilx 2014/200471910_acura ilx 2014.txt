I own the 2014 ILX base 2.0L 5-sp auto. First off, the 150 hp engine is just fine, thanks. I can cruise at 80 mph on the interstate all day long. I've had no issues running at very high altitude climbing fairly steep grades, and getting up to speed is quick at about 8 sec 0-60 -- once the engine is broken in. It's also economical. I'm averaging 30 mpg with ~8K miles of mixed driving. The differences between the 2014 and 2013 are not minor. The 2014 now comes standard with heated leather seats (driver's is powered), rear-backup camera, 17" alloys, and additional sound deadening, including active noise reduction. I'm 6'1" and I fit in the car just fine. Go test drive one yourself.

I have to say my new ILX is a great car.
The engine is really responsive and the shifting is really smooth.
The interior is finished very well and the leather wrapped steering wheel feels great on the hands.

Handling is excellent, the car goes exactly where you point it.
After the car is broken in, the car is really sporty to drive.
I think the car is underrated.
Consumer Reports does a great job recommending the ILX, other reviewers complain that the ILX is underpowered, but I would give it a test drive.
I drove the new Accord and the Subaru Legacy and I liked the ILX a lot better.
I like how compact and zippy it feels.

I am an Acura Fan and in love with the ILX
