I just replaced my Scion xA with a Yaris L 5-door in Classic Silver and I have to say that I really like this car a lot.
I'm so glad that Toyota did away with the awful center mounted gauges.
I had those in my Scion xA and grew to hate the whole setup after a few years.
The interior in the Yaris is extremely well designed with easy to use controls, nice materials and very good fit and finish.
It feels like a much larger, more expensive car than it actually is and drives great in the city, on the thruway, and even in the snow and ice.
Out the door with tax and everything, the Yaris was a very reasonable $17,700.
The Yaris is also one on the most reliable cars you can buy.
