I owned a 2011 LX 570 and enjoyed it, it drove great  and I never had any problems with the SUV.
I purchased a 2014 LX 570, 3 months ago and have been surprised & disappointed. The electronics system sucks. The navigation is not up to date, there are 36 presets on the radio sound system, but I am not able to label them. So I have 36 numbers. It is a danger looking for a particular station. The weather map looks like a five year old with a magic marker.  The Lexus Enform App never works.
$93K and I have a 1990 Ford Escort electronics package.
