Traded my 2008 Toyota Highlander Limited for the Venza AWD...I love it ! I call it a baby Highlander ! The Golden Umber Mica is a sharp, beautiful color that gets many comments ! The ride is smooth and very quiet. The engine purrs just like the Highlander, as the V6 is the same. 
The comfort and roomy interior is wonderful, and it's a fun car to drive ! The fit and finish seems to have improved in the 2013 , as mine is wonderful looking. Test drive a Venza...you will love it !

I've only had my gray XLE AWD for a few days but so far I'm pleased.
I was looking for a reliable, good looking ride with decent mpg and utility that's reasonably fun to drive.
The Venza is great looking. The sheet metal which hasn't changed since the model was introduced in 2009 looks great from all angles and is enhanced with the bold 20" alloy wheels and the dual chrome tipped exhaust.
Most notable change is the grill which looks good
It's nicely equipped including the entune audio/nav system with backup camera, power tailgate, smart key, homelink
Solid feel, reasonably fun to drive, quick and nimble.
Good headroom (no sunroof) was essential as I'm 6'-6. Seats are comfortable.
