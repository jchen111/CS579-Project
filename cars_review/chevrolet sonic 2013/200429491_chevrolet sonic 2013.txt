Have LTZ with the 1.4 Turbo.
Great engine, feels strong and pulls well.
Combined gas mileage so far is above 30 MPG in mostly city driving. Composed ride, car sticks to the road in turns. The car feels very solid, a pleasure to drive. Visibility is great. 

The media system works well, the phone operation, the media applications and the radio itself. Large screen provides a lot of information in a friendly and clear manner.


Remote Link with OnStar allows you to start the engine from far, far away, all done via satellite.
Tried to use the turn by turn directions via OnStar and it did work very well too, you can download your route via smartphone. 

Overall happy with the car.

I bought this car 10 months ago.
I have about 10,000 miles on it.
I have the 2012 LTZ hatchback in Orange and love it.

I only had it for one day but if yesterday is any indication, life just got waaaayyyy better.
I went across state to by it to get the exact features I wanted so I had a nice 55 minute ride home to test her out.
Driving at 67mph I hit the mpg reset key and it showed 40-42 mpg!! For me that is nice but the reason I purchased this car was not for the mpg or even for the looks because I like the look of the Kia Rio SX a little better.
The reason I went with the sonic was that big fat grin that comes on my face when I get behind the wheel and press the gas pedal.
This is the first turbo I have ever owned and boy is it fun to drive.
I even woke up in the night just to take her out for a spin!
