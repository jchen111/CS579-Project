Ok 1k miles so far and my subaru impreza 2.0 sport premium 5 speed has more than any ture real world driver needs. in pouring rain no problem cornering at speed. snow storm no problem. All those pathetic BMW and Benz drivers struggled to gain confidence, while I drove and could feel the vehicles amazing stability, and impressive control.
heated seats work better than my acura tsx, its a functional, fun, good looking, family, and weekend warrior, or bachelor go outdoor vehicle. If you want fancy .. its bluetooth, and can get optional nav. big whoop. buy a gps for 100 bucks, and save your dough. brakes are a 9 of 10 . WHEN THE ZOMBIES COME, you will sk yourself.... GOT SUBARU?
