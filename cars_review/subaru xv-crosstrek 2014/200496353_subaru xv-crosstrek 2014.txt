I've actually had an entirely different experience with my Crosstrek Hybrid, other than I can agree with another user's problems with the navigation.

There are so many rattles, all over the car. The worst is with the plastic covering the speedometer and tachometer displays. People who ride in my car say things like, "Doesn't that noise drive you crazy?"

Mine was delivered in November, so I wonder if it's early off the manufacturing line and those problems have been worked out. 

Subaru has been most unhelpful in resolving my issues -Â this will be my last Subaru.

I've had my XV Crosstrek hybrid for two months now and have been extremely happy with it. I've been getting 35 mpg around town and about 38mpg hwy, which is double than my 2003 Baja. Comfortable ride, minimal road noise, a lot of get up and go from a stand still, & the CVT transmission has been smooth. I've had several people (including a police officer pull up to me) to ask me about the car-
"I didn't know Subaru made a hydrid."

If you're looking for Prius like mileage, than buy a Prius; Although you won't have the awesome AWD of a Subaru, headroom, legroom, cargo carrying ability, nor will your Prius be able to get out of its own way in a sticky traffic situation.

Not getting the suggested MPGs so far during a cold winter; hoping it improves. Car rarely runs in "green" power based on the indicator.
Otherwise
it's decent enough/comfortable.
I got the touring model, which has all the bells & whistles, some of which I don't understand, such as the entertainment system.
But it has everything I'd ever want in a vehicle + other stuff.
But, so far, it's not fulling the primary expectation.

I purchased the Hybrid Touring about a month ago, and have over 1,400 miles on it.
For context, I live in the Northeast, and the weather has been brutal pretty much each day since I've owned it.
The car drives really nicely.
It is quiet, and the steering has good feedback without being overly stiff.
It also has a nice exterior look.
Traction has been great.
As far as the mileage, it has been disappointing.
It has averaged about 27 MPG.
Like I said, the weather has been really cold, and it is only 1,400 miles, so that might be holding it back.
Even with highway only trips I have not been able to average over 29MPG, and I'm not a super fast driver.
