Well, after looking at all the other three-row SUVs out there, and driving a bunch of them, my wife fell head over heels for the styling and features of the Durango Citadel.
It was thousands cheaper then the competing vehicles from Buick and GMC, while driving better IMHO, plus, the interior quality as well as the feature ease and understanding of the intuitive controls was the best in class in our view.
Our black granite pearl with chrome Durango turns heads everywhere, and with it's glare in front and racetrack taillights out back, the first night we had it, our son remarked, "Lord Vader, your ship is here".
The ride and drive is stunningly solid and quiet.
LOVE IT!

My wife and I are still shocked we are driving a Durango.
Wife traded her 2008 Infiniti QX56 which she loved but it had a lot of miles on it so it was time for something new/newer.
Cross-shopped QX56, QX60, Pathfinder, Acadia, Enclave, MDX, Explorer.
Stumbled upon Durango Citadel model and was shocked.
The interior quality and tech options are amazing and the exterior is unique as well.
Drives so nice and smooth.
Ton of looks by people trying to figure out what it is as there are not many on the road.
If they sold under Jeep as Extended Grand Cherokee they would sell a ton as it is built on same platform along with Mercedes GL SUV.
Ok though as I like our "secret".
Test drive one!

Love it! It is fun to dive rides nice looks very nice inside & out totally different from the older version. the captains seats in the second row are great comfort. The navigation is a nice touch with a big screen! stereo system is awsome don't need to add extra to it. the only bad thing I can say about this is the fuel miliage but what do you expect with a HEMI! I love it.
