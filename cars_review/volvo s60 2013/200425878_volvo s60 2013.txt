No Volvo is better than the S80 until my engine blew after 32000 miles.
 For one month I drove loaner S60 T5 2012.
I decided to buy one even though it was not comfortable and has no style. Factory incentives made it more advantageous to buy a new 2013.
After the first day, the car when given light gas as in heavy traffic or starting from stop has a rattle sound like a paint can.
The car went back 10 times from the dealer.
A file was opened by Volvo NA and they said they all do that because of the CVTrans.
The 2012 has different drive train.
This car is junk and everytime I hear that rattle which is everytime I drive it reminds me of a $40K mistake.
After 5 V's the next car is Lexus

Found myself shifting the trans to "Sport" mode because in drive mode it shifts like a granny and is unresponsive; it short shifts into 2nd gear when under moderate to heavy throttle.
In regular mode off the line, this car feels like a prius.
It is slow to accelerate and short-shifts every gear.
When trying to pass, the transmission takes too long to respond.
I would not buy this car. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything about this car is junk. Build quality, mechanical quality, transmission programming.

I have never had a car I hated this much. Just wish it wasn't leased so I could trade it in.

Don't believe what you read. I have driven other examples and they are similarly afflicted.

I have owned a T5 AWD automatic premier for 5 months. I have averaged 19 MPG combined! That is just plain awful for a 5 cylinder. And no, I do not have a lead foot. This is typical suburban driving and light commuting. (FYI: In 2015, the new 4 cyl engine is faster and gets 25 city, 37 highway.) Other than that the car handles great, is very smooth and comfortable and has very good acceleration.
I have had no problems so far. Another negative is that the controls, radio, seat heater etc. are difficult to operate and poorly designed. This car is smoother, more comfortable, quieter, and handles better than my wife's 2012 Acura TL. I got a great deal on a demo, but I should have waited.

Well, where do I start. Let's do the good stuff:
I love the interior, it is comfortable.
The freeway ride quality is great.
It is fairly quiet on good road surfaces.

Now the bad stuff:
Had an a/c problem with a pressure relief valve. Took 4 visits to resolve even though it is a known issue.
Had a bad fuel pump, causing hard starting from cold. Took 4 visits to resolve even though it is a known issue.
Have a steering wobble at speeds around 40mph. This is "normal" according to Volvo.
Engine surges and is jerky in any gear and at any speed. This is "normal" according to Volvo.
Transmission experiences a delay engaging first gear when pulling away from a stop. This results in a jerk.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A thrill to drive.
Salesman said it can out-perform a police cruiser and I believe it.

Since 1996 IÂve owned various new A4Âs, an A6 and A3 (IÂve always preferred AudiÂs over BMWÂs and Mercedes and never considered VOLVO). 

In short, after test driving a 2013 S60 T5, Âit was a no brainerÂ I went ahead and leased it on the spot (it was that easy). 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only about 400 miles on the car so far, so still breaking it in.
The car is smooth and very comfortable, and I'm enjoying the T5's engine, which has better and smoother pickup than the VW EOS I traded in.

For the money, I don't think there is a car on the road with more comfortable seats than the Volvo.
The infotainment system is pretty intuitive.
There is a bit of wind noise in the cabin.
So far getting 23 MPG on regular, which should improve a bit when broken in.

The sales staff at Maroone/AutoNation Volvo in Delray Beach were easy to work with, and very accomodating when I had to factory order the car to get the ext/int combination I wanted.
I also got a very fair deal & trade.

My previous car was a top of the line 2006 Chrysler Town and Country. With the kids finally grown, I wanted a nice sedan to replace it after my son wrecked it. Of course, after a wreck, you want something safe. This car was the perfect balance of luxury, ride, performance, and gas mileage, all on REGULAR gas! Other luxury performance cars are strictly Premium grade gas. And this car passed the newest type of crash test at the IIHS which Mercedes, Audi, BMW didn't pass at all. Acura barely passed. Do other cars get better performance specs? Sure, but they cost noticably more. BMW gets better mileage, but again at higher purchase price and premium gas.

I was looking for a replacement for my '03 IS300 Sportcross and ended up test driving everything from a Mini Clubman S to the new Lexus ES.
All over the map.
But I kept coming back to the Volvo S60 because it was comfortable to drive (front seats are amazing), felt solid as a rock, had good acceleration running on regular, and could be bought for much less than competitors.
The long term review of the 2012 model on Inside Line was almost all positive as were other published reports.
The 2013 T5 model improved in acceleration and gas mileage, nice combo of improvements.
 Reliable, comfortable, a great value. So now I own a Caspian blue with beechwood leather S60 T5 and am a happy camper.
