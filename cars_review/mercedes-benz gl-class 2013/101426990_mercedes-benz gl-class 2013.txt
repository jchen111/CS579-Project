I have experienced seemingly unending electronic failure issues with only 5,000 miles on vehicle:

Failure to go into sleep mode causing dead battery;towed to dealer 200 mi. away, MB refused to return to my location;

When vehicle is locked, one door, although locked, causes alarm and will open if handle is touched, even if EasyGo key is not present;

Adaptive High Beam headlight failure;

Rear tailgate opens with driver door occasionally;

When spraying the car with water, while washing, doors lock and unlock continually if you have key in pocket; circuit board replaced, issue continues- another appt. made

Where is the quality control?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordered the 450 in February and took delivery in April, convenience 2 and heavily optioned but skipped the off-road stuff, automatic cruise, panoramic roof, and lane-assist.
Would have ordered the diesel but dealers steered me clear given biodiesel content in Illinois - no complaints with the V-8; sounds great.
This is not, however, a car that cries to be driven fast - big (which is why I bought it), heavy vehicle.
Awesome for interstate cruising or tooling around town.
Very quiet; smooth ride, although I hate the numb electronic steering.
Great styling inside and out.
Command system works fine for me, extremely comfortable, lots of convenience features.
As good as advertised.

Just took delivery of my wife's GL 450 and I am blown away by how quiet, solid and comforting this vehicle is. It really rivals the S class. When I test drove a lesser equipped vehicle I liked how well the vehicle performed. I loaded this vehicle out and I am not sure why but the vehicle is even nicer than I remember. Acceleration is adequate, braking is superb and the ride is awesome. Looked at all the competing models but kept coming back to Mercedes. The price does escalate as you add options as it does with others. If you are in the market for an SUV you owe it to yourself to at least give the GL some consideration.
