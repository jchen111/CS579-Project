Rock solid SUV! It's the first vehicle my wife may admit is better than her audi Q7 tdi. The designo interior is amazing. I thought the radar guided cruise would be a joke, but I love it. With direct fuel injection and two turbos, my diesel days may well be over. 510pound-feet of torque wait at LOW rpm to effortlessly pull any load.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the end of October 2012 we traded in my wifeÂs 2008 Mercedes 4matic (station wagon) for a new Mercedes 2013 GL550.
We love the exterior design of the car and the flexibility on the interior design with the third row seats.
The acceleration of the car is incredible-no problem merging onto the freeway or passing.
Gas mileage is not the cars strong suit but I did not expect it to be.

Now the bad, at 4000 miles the car needs new front rotors which are not yet a stocking item at my dealership-10 day wait! A In addition both side view mirrors are defective-drivers side is frosted and the passengerÂs side has two stripped bolts off its backing plate.
