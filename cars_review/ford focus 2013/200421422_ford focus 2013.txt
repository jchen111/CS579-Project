I bought this car new in June of 2013. I commute 70 miles each way and the gas for my SUV was killing me. I test drove the automatic and disliked the feel, then drove the 5 speed and liked it much better. I now have 55k miles on the car and it still runs as well as when I drove it off the lot. I have had no mechanical issues whatsoever in all those miles and have found the Focus to be a comfortable vehicle. A third of my commute is down a windy mountain road and the Focus handles it very well. It drives well in the rain and I had no complaints with its abilities in the snow last winter. Overall, an excellent vehicle.

In July purchased a new 2013 Focus standard transmission.
I commute 200 KMs daily and when the car was at 1600 KM I heard a clunk while on the HWY in 5th gear doing over 100 KM an hour.
The car would not accelerate over 80 KM, the dealer looked it over and said nothing is wrong.
A few weeks later sitting on the HWY stopped behind other vehicles and tried to accelerate into the right lane.
The car chugged and almost stalled, this has happen a few times.
I have an open CSR with Ford and they told me to leave the car with them for the week.
I was told they couldn't find anything so I took a mechanic out for a drive.
The issue happened, I am told this is normal traction control stop the C

Great car for the price, got mine for what I consider a 'steal'.
Drives like european sedan...puts a smile on my face the way it goes around turns effortlessly.
Engine not yet broken in, and computer needs to be calibrated but so far I can exceed 40mpg going 65, and hit 35 going 75. 

This car needs almost no maintenance! GladI didn't purchase extended warranty: Platinum plugs, ceramic brake pads, synthetic tranny lube, top consume reports rated cooper tires, this car is built to last (I hope!).

If you do buy this car, I recommend going with car and driver's advice and buying a manual SE model with the upgrade package, allowing you to avoid My Ford Touch and dullard of an auto tranny.

GRINDING TRANSMISSION.
ROLLS BACK.
In the shop as we speak....A.C. COMPRESSOR ORDERED, TO
BE REPLACED.

 This is a brand NEW, 2013 Ford Focus SE.
 God, why didn't we research??
First were interested in Escape and Fusion,2013 models. 

We spoke to General Sales manager, after getting nothing but the company spiel from lease salesman.
Bottom line :
Transmission guy will take a look at Focus on Monday.
We DO NOT want this car.
Ford official stand is all the grinding, rolling backwards, etc is normal...Handles different, drive it 6 months, get used to the car.

I bought my Ford Focus SES new and have performed all of the routine maintenance myself.
The vehicle has not required any repair.
I primarily drive and service with an emphasis on preserving the reliability of the automobile.
I have replaced the battery and wiper blades only.
The origional tires show 50% wear.
I live in Las Vegas, NV, and high summer temperatures kill automobile batteries.
I get only 2+ years of battery service in our vehicles.
I buy batteries from Ford.
They last longer than other batterys,
ie:
Walmart, K Mart, etc.
If I drive conservatively, I achieve the EPA fuel economy ratings.
Best handling small car I have ever owned.
37K miles, Always garaged.

2013 Ford Focus SE automatic Hatchback
I wish that I had never bought this car.
For starters, the average fuel economy is not what Ford advertises.
My average MPG is 32 hwy at 69mph. The best was 36mpg with a tail wind.

I can live with the poor fuel economy...but the deciding factor for me to get rid of this car is the Torturous seats !!
The seats are rock hard ! They feel like you're sitting on a park bench ! The padding in the seats is very minimal.
Push down 1/2 inch and you can actually feel the metal framework of the seat. The very design of the seats are not ergonomic.
The front of the seats are tilted in a way that if you stretch out, the back of your legs will begin to hurt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have had the Focus Hatchback for 2 months and was very pleased with everything for the first week but by the second week it was making noise when accelerating and cont. to get worse.
I brought the car to the Dealership and they said they could not do anything till 1000 miles.
I brought it back at 1000 miles but Ford says this problem is occuring on the 2013 Focus but the engineers do not know what the problem is so they can not fix it yet.
They returned the car to me and told me to keep driving until the problem is fiqured out.
This makes me very nervous, what could happen to it next. I would think about another car until they have fiqured these quirks out.

I've owned a 2013 Focus for two months now and it's been back to the shop twice for bad grounding wires in two different spots.
The last one was for the fuel pump so the car died in the middle of traffic without warning!!
Not the reliability you'd expect from a car with 1400 miles on it.
The dealership just laughs it off.
Ford has come a long way but their individual dealerships still has a lot to learn!!

Read up on their Electronic Power Assist Steering
too.
Not the sales hype either, find the complaints, there is a Tech Bulletin released on the problem but once again, the service center at the dealership acts as if there is no problem.
My advice ... shop elsewhere.

Ok, I got to the Ford Focus by accident. I originally went to the local dealer to see a Fiesta, but their inventory was nonexistent, then I asked for the Focus and they only had one. Next door was a Honda dealer so we looked at a Civic, Liked it, but they would not do a deal over rims. So I went to Spokane to Wendle Motors after looking at their inventory online. Sent two car that I wanted to look at and they had them all ready for me. Test drove a White focus SE and a Grey Fiesta, loved both chose the Focus. No issues with it, small learning curve with all the controls, handles well and Good gas mileage so far. No issues with trany. I would recommend this car.
in is an auto not 5 speed.

I fell in love with this car the moment I sat in it.
For the most part, it is very well designed, the handling is incredible and it is a great value.
It is a quiet ride and a very fun car to drive around town.
But, there are a couple of opportunities for improvement
(see Suggested Improvements).
I'm getting about 24MPG on short, in-town trips this winter.
