We have a 2013 Porsche 911 cab (not an s).
It is as good a quality as we have ever had (had over 100 cars).
Fun to drive, good ergonomics.
It is a sports car and rides as such ... not a gt tourer.
Weakness is that for $115 thousand, it should have a backup camera, satellite radio and key-less-go standard.
It does not.
So the car is rather unsophisticated.
As of Dec 31, 2013 we have 8500 miles on the car.
