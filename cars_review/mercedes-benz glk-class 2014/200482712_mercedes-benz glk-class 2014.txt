The GLK is exactly what I was looking for. A lot of the SUV's out there today are nothing more than mini-vans designed to appeal to male drivers. That being said, I purchased the GLK for two reasons: performance and quality. The GLK moves; it's nimble, deceivingly quick (when in sport mode) and it holds corners very well. The paddle shifters are awesome! The exterior has very distinct, bold lines and the interior is luxury as it should be. If you have need for more cargo room than a sedan, but don't want sacrifice performance... the GLK is for you. Oh, and it's a Mercedes- German engineering. Need I say more?
