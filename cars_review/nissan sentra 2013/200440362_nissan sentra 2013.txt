I have a 2013 Sentra SL- At 2837 miles, The car went completely dead- electric system shut down. It was in my garage so no safety issue- Had the car towed. Local dealership said it was an internal failure in the IPDM. After 4 days and replacing this, car ran fine. Nissan paid for a 3 day rental. It happened again last night- approx. 11,000 miles- dead as a doornail. Spent the morning waiting on a tow, setting up a rental car, etc. Waiting to hear from the dealer. Nissan has promised a 3 day rental but COME ON GUYS! I'm a single Mom- no one to help me get to work- no work, no pay! 
I thought I was getting a RELIABLE car- AM I GOING TO BE ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS like the GM DRIVERS? I'M SCARED!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have only 16600 Miles.The Car already has a recall for stalling problems. Looks the Dealer just raised the accelerator level since the engine makes high level transmission noise while coming down slopes. Now the ABS and traction lights has come up. Upon Dealer inspection they found the ABS connector wire is cut off. Its a skinny ABS cable which is not properly covered from end to end with some thick plastic/tape and can get cut/damage easily from any object on the road while Driving and hanging like a Cradle.
Nissan should understand that ABS is a major part of the braking system and Nissan Customer Service is not helpful. They should recall the Cars for replacement of ABS connector.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had a review I previously submitted and Edmund's never posted.
My SL now has close to 18,000 miles on it.
Within the first 500 miles the Fuel sending Unit failed.
I had to wait 2 months to get the part and I had to get Nissan Consumer Affairs involved.
Good style inside and out, but poorly executed.
Quality control is all over the place with Nissan; no consistency with different loaners I was given to fix other issues.
CVT transmission among the worst built CVT's in the industry.
Now having trouble with rear drum brakes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GOOD:
Interior/Exterior design and fit and finish.
Ride quality excellent for highway which is what I mostly do.
Stock SL sound system is ample.
Voice activated Bluetooth is great!
LED accents make the car look better.
That's about where it ends.

The BAD:
CVT transmission's are just terrible in general, but Nissan JATCO's are probably the worst built out there.
I wonder if mine will last.
Terrible wiper design.
Driver side wiper too long so it's trying to clean off too large an area that leaves a smeared mess on the passenger side.
Driver wiper also is half hidden/half protrudes.
Continued below...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purchased the car in February 2013.
Car has had multiple transmission problems since then.
Nissan customer service has been less than helpful and does not work on Sundays, making it impossible to find a solution to getting to work on Monday.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This car is definitely a huge improvement over the 2012 Sentra and I really like the look of the exterior and interior. I have been getting about 23 MPG in city driving and 30+ in highway driving. I took it on a trip to Pennsylvania and averaged 39 MPG for the entire trip! I know others have complained about the lack of power in this car, I agree that this is no race car and more power would make it more fun to drive. But overall the powertrain serves its purpose very well and I have never had any problems merging onto highways or anything like that. It's meant to be a commuting car and the compact size, good fuel economy and backup camera make it a perfect car for city driving.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I purchased my Sentra 2 months ago and have 5200 miles on it.
I traded a 2012 Rogue for it, because I got extremely poor gas mileage one the Rogue.
I am averaging approximately 33 miles per gallon around town (that is me figuring out the mileage when I fill up).
I don't know how the person who is only getting around 300 miles per a tank is driving, but I have never gotten less than 350 per a tank and that was in the beginning.
I got the Leather Pkg, The Premium Pkg, and the Technology Pkg.
I actually had a 2009 Altima also, and I like this car better, to me the front seat is very comfortable, I was worried since it was not power.
I would highly recommend this car.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just bought the NIssan Sentra 2013, and nobody really noticed! And the more I drive it I know why. 


Though upgraded from the previous model, Nissan went back to archives and pulled out the "GOTO" Nissan Altima file and just made it smaller. 

I bought the SL model with the wood grain, LED Lights, and dual temperature. The salesmen said it was loaded, but not really I should have looked up what "Loaded" is defined as according to Nissan.


Bad: The model has LED lighting but it fails to light up the buttons on the door making it difficult to see the buttons at night, unless you open door.It doesn't seamessly go from low to high speed without a loud noise in the engine, unlike our NIssan Altima. There is a delay.
Some highway noise too, and the windshield if you are short looks bifocal like and the lines on the road seem to wave, much like a bifocal glass.Moving the seat too is manual pumping. (Cheap!) I mean really they couldn't give you auto seats with the SL model. 


Thus far in comparison to the SUV i was driving I am saving a bit on gas, but though I am paying less, I seem to filling up almost the same. Hmmm! 


The sound system is good, but they trick you by putting in faux speakers in the doors, but no sound. What?


I am grateful to God for allowing us to purchase this car, but some prayers should be left unanswered. 


Im already thinking of trading it in at 550 miles.
