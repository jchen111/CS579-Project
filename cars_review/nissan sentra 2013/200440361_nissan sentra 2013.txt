my sentra sr is stalling on me when i start my car in the morning,, i always warm it up for 10 min, and lately it has been stalling on me  in reverse,,idles below 1 and makes a real weird whinning noise kinda like a old honda...when i come to a stop the idle just drops below 1 and then it dies like it ran out of gas,,electric is still on brakes dont lock up but seems to be getting worse,,going to the dealer tomorrow.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the 3rd Sentra I have owned and by far my favorite!  I had a 2002, 2008 & now 2013 and never had a problem with any of them until now.  On my first drive in the 2013 the car turned off while I was driving.  No lights nothing, just off.  It turned right back on and I took it in and Nissan was great!  2 transmission updates and I was on the road again.  I just hit 30,000 miles and coasted into the dealership. I need a new transmission.  I don't know how long they are going to have my car but I miss it already.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reading these reviews, it seems almost like someone only does a review when there's a problem. I have had my '13 Sentra SR since around the first of January 2014 and have put 21,000 miles on it during that time. That's a lot of miles but I bought it primarily as a commuter car. I can tell you that I have had no problems, it runs and drives just like when new. Gas mileage averaged around 31 when new and started averaging 35 (about 65% highway overall). After owning 9 Nissans I've found they don't start getting their better mileage numbers until about 12-15K on the odometer. I think it would average about 3-4mpgs better if they didn't sell 10% ethanol gas where I live (North Louisiana).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bought my Nissan Sentra Dec of 2012. A week later i took it back cause the rubber seal around the front window came off. Took it to go looked at cause i can never get my music to bluetooth. took it back again cause while driving it, it felt like it was going to bog out and die. (Friend drove my car and freaked out) they couldn't re create it! took it back again for a sensor re call in the passenger seat that linked to the air bags not deploying!! Got that fixed. Then took it back, cause i was driving it home and the car lost all power and would not go past 2000 RPM.(Couldnt find anything wrong) Ran out of space for everythingOverall I dont like the car. Gonna get me something else here soon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love my sentra its the color I want the design I love and the gas economy I need. Although my car is 8 months old the transmission went out on it and is being replaced.
I hope this is all I run into for quality of the build of this car.
Lemon law says I have 18 months or 18,000 miles so hopefully this is the only issue with the car....
I am looking for other issues these 2013 Sentra's may have as well to have them checked out before it happens .. I did see the stalling issue which I shall address at the dealership.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have a 2013 sentr sr with 600 miles. So far everything seems fine. A couple of things I've noticed is the cvt transmission takes a lot to get use to. It's either slowing down or speeding up. It just took time to get the feel for it and learn the cvt. the Mpg's are okay. I drive about 8 miles a day and I'm getting 250 miles a tank. I'm sure on the highway I'll get the full 350-400 miles my wife's gets. The performance is blah which is to be suspected, it's not a sports car. I like it for what it is. I liked it more then the corolla I test drove and more then the civic. You get more bang for the buck with the Sentra in my opinion. I will update later.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I leased my Sentra at the end of July and love it! I turned in 2010 Sentra I had, and do love this car more.
My only complaint is the size of the center console, the 2010 model was much bigger which I loved.
I love the LED accent lights inside and out.
I am averaging about 35 MPG and my commute to work is only about 10 minutes mainly highway.
The engine is extremely quiet, and love both the ECO and Sport features.
I have the Black with Charcoal interior.
Inside is easy to keep clean too.
The leg room in both the back and front is roomy compared to my old Sentra.
Would recommend! 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll get right to my point.
I just purchased a 2013 Sentra SR.
Originally looking at Optima, Sonata, Altima and Accord.
Optima and Sonata don't come with spare tires??
Ruled out.
I liked the Altima better to drive but ruled it our due to additional cost and size (fitting in my garage).
The Accord was just too boring.
I am a retired Toyota Salesperson.
I have driven most cars in this category at one time or another.
Was introduced to the Sentra by a neighbor.
Read every road test and drove a demo 3 times.
Every professional criticized the car for noise and acceleration.
In a 0-60 mph race the Sentra beat the Corolla and Civic.
The performance is about the same as the Corolla I
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've owned my Sentra SR with the Driver's Package for one week.
I previously drove a 10-year old Corolla with a lot of life left in it but in looking toward the future, now was the right time to make a purchase.
I am a lifelong Toyota owner and am hoping this car is as reliable as my Toyotas have been.
I compared the
2013 Corolla, Mazda 3, Jetta, Civic, Elantra and Sentra.
Each had its benefits and drawbacks - it comes down to finding the right fit for the driver.
I do not feel like I am driving an "economy" car which was part of the appeal of the Sentra.
I have heard it called the "Small-tima" because it closely resembles the Altima.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have to say I am so surprised by how much I love this car.
I wasn't expecting it to be so comfortable, so quiet, and fun to drive.
Especially because I was coming from a 2010 GTI.
I had enough with the constant problems and decided to take advantage of a great lease deal on a fully loaded 2013 Sentra SR.
Really this car is great.
It's quiet on the highway, seats are comfortable, GPS is awesome, all in all I actually like it better than the VW.
Can't comment on gas mileage though.. I only have 350 miles on it so its not broken in yet.
Only averaging 28-30 mpg, but I expect that to increase after I hit 1000-2000 miles on the odometer.
