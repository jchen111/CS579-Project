This is a nice car.
I've been reading the other reviews about the brakes, and I found out, almost accidently, that the rear brakes were recalled.
They were fixed in less than an hour.
The brake pedal does travel a bit more than normal, but we got used to it

Generally, it's a nice car and gets very good gas milage.
I average about 32 mpg, and that's a combination of city and highway mileage.


The car is very roomy inside.
5 adults fit very comfortably, and the ride is smooth and not too noisy
