I got this car back in March. It is now 8 months old with 12,000 miles on it. There is a whine coming from the rear breaks. I took the car in and they said my rear breaks are wearing and it will take at least a month before the parts come in. The gas mileage is at 20 mph and they have no idea why. When I turn the wheel left or right there is huge clunking noise. (I am told this is normal) My front brakes are wearing faster than they should. The car has been in 3 times for the rear brakes.I have to slam on the gas pedal before the brakes engage. I'm considering using the lemon law.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought this car a month ago and when I first bought, I loved it. Well after many tanks of gas and 13 trips to the dealership, (in one month I might add) I ended up getting rid of it. I live at a mile high so lower gas mileage is to be expected but I was getting the gas mileage of a gas guzzling SUV not a economy car. I bought the SV model sentra and was getting only 240 miles to a tank. Then it started idling rough. It would shake so hard my kids would notice when the passenger seat would shake. I ended up with a 2013 Altima and so far Im in love. I have only had the Alitma 24 hours and im hoping this car will be much better. Stay tuned......... 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have experienced problems with the AC blowing hot air and the rear brakes developing a loud metallic grinding/crackling noise. The first time I took it to the dealership they kept the car overnight - the service adviser said there was a service bulletin on the brakes and the brake cylinders needed some lubing. They had no idea why the AC was not cooling periodically. I picked the car up and after a week or so the brakes had the same issue and the AC was HOT all the time! Very uncomfortable driving in 100F+ weather with the windows down! The dealership kept it for 2 nights and figured the brake cylinders had to be replaced as well as the AC compressor. Covered by warranty but what's next???
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I tried the new Civic, Elentra, Dart, Mazda 3,Corolla, Focus. Basically every car on the compact market. When I test drove the Sentra, I liked it the most.
I have now owned the car for 4 months and I still love it from day one. I will admit there is a major lack of power. You are not getting up to speed very quickly. The CVT is/can be very loud (but if you have the radio on, it tends to make the CVT quieter.) Slow down then step on the gas, the CVT gets even loud The styling inside and out are great, but the hubcaps on the car are awful. The handling is good, but you have to take sharp turns I would recommend going slow. The suspension is stiff, but I find that it come in handy over bumps.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought this car about 2 months ago. I got the navigation package and the driver's package. I love the Intelligent key and the touch screen. The car handles well and it gets great gas millage. When I fill up, on the dashboard it says I get 450 miles for one tank! I get 33 in the city and 38 on the highway. I drive about 30 miles a day and I do not have to fill up for a week.


I turn heads every where I go. I have had people ask me if it a Lexus or Acura. People tell me that they love the look of the car. 

This is my second Sentra (I had a 2011), I love this one more and it feels like a bigger car than it actually is. Great Car, I would recommend this.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sentra is a good car Runs well and gets good gas mileage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having driven it for 1,400 miles I still feel it's a great value. LIKES: The int/ext styling is nice and Nissan used high quality materials; rear legroom & trunk space is outstanding; great gas mileage; bluetooth/USB/AUX; XM radio; Auto headlights; quiet ride on highway; lit kickplates. DISLIKES: Underpowered (feel like I'm gassing it more than I would expect to); small gas tank (Averaging around 300-330miles per tank); lack of storage compartments & center console is too far back for arm rest; can't extend steering wheel out as much causing awkward driving posture; driver seat should be more comfortable with lumbar adjustment; loud engine when accelarating; no maintenance reminder.

Bought this car last week have read all the reviews and feel they are not all realistic ! I find the car to be an exceptional value , very distinguished looks, huge cab and trunk , and comfortable seats . The Car feels like a midsize car I traded in a Kia Optima
and if feels about the same size . Performance of this car so far has been more than adequate for me and my needs. You cant expect to get great gas mileage and have a race car too! I am getting excellent fuel economy, nice ride , very little road noise ,and handles nicely with no surprises . I have the base stereo system and find it to be more than adequate for my needs . 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I own the 2013 Sentra SV model. I bought this car at the beginning of 2013.
All I can say is that its an excellent vehicle for the price.
The fuel economy is fantastic. I have to say though that I was quite surprised how this car performed compared to a Civic and Elantra which were the other vehicles I was considering at the time.
The 2013 Sentra had the most space both in the trunk and interior for passengers compared to the other cars (amazing head room cause im 6ft tall.
It also had the best features with different trims.
Don't complain about mediocre acceleration or engine thrills,
this ain't a Ferrari or BMW.
Its safe,efficient and roomy.
The Trifecta for sub-compacts.
