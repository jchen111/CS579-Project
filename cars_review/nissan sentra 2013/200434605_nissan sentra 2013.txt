I bought my 2013 base Sentra S with 6sp manual in mid March. Gas mileage rocks! I get in the high 30's to low 40's in regular mode. I consistantly get 360 miles per tank of fuel using about 9 gallons. This is mixed driving with sometimes frequent stops. Seats are insanely uncomfortable but not a deal breaker given the price. Mine listed for $17,000 and I purchased for $14,000. I feel this was a great negotiated price considering that it is an all new look without lots of incentives. I selected the silver with Charcoal interior...looks great with added body side molding and really dark-tinted windows.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I drive in the ECO mode, I easily get 45 mpg and trying hard can get 50 mpg in normal Boston area commuting.
In normal mode I get 42 mpg.
The sport mode is fun.
I understand why each Nissan dealer I spoke with when I was shopping stated that the mpg rating was far too low.
The manual rating is 36 highway and lower combined.
This is a ridiculously low rating.
The handling is a little soft, but the tires are for high mpg.
The braking and acceleration is really good.
