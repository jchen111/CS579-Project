This car makes weird noises. The motor sounds like birds chirping and it makes me nervous. Is it supposed to sound like this? Sure wish I had a rear camera. The visibility is bad over the shoulder. Interior noise is fair. Car is bulky for it's actual size. Handling is pretty amazing. Really holds the road. Very fun drive. However very little power, but probably enough for normal driving. Not a race car, but kinda handles like one. Boasts some good gas mileage, but haven't experienced that yet. I hope it's just because it needs to be "broken in".

My frame of reference is comparing this with other autos I've owned.
I just ordered a cx5 2013 awd stripped down Sport in April and it arrived from japan mid June.

The blue color on the catalog color cover is exactly right not the color on the inside color option page.
Lift the hood at a dealer and the engine block on all types (I suspect) is blue- that's the blue I got and I love it.

The kids have these complaints.: cup holders, back window to small, more room in the van.

I am missing armrests, like the van has.
My van gets 23 mpg awd, this gets 29 awd.

Manual shift is odd, better gas not using it anyway.

It has a more active ride- don'tdrink coffee on a rough road!
Overall I like it.
