All my trepidation of owning a diesel in a cold climate have melted away.
Cold weather operations a breeze due to heated seats ( not like the seat warmers in my Q5) that even my wife had to turn down. Audi has an aux heater that starts blowing hot air in about 2-3 mins when it's -20.
I commute everyday and fill my tank about once a month. The fuel economy is attractive paying for itself each time I fill-up.
