I loved this car but after 18 months the brake pads went bad. According to the dealer there was no reason and since the warranty on those expires at 12,000 miles or 12 months we were stuck with having to pay for all new rear brake pads and rotors. There is no reason they should have failed and Mazda Customer Service said "Too bad not under warranty". The MPG has also steadily declined after 6 months even with regular maintenance. I am disappointed since we bought it for it's supposed fuel efficiency and safety. After this experience I do not expect this to be a reliable long lived car and will not buy a Mazda in the future.

The only Mazda I have owned are Miata (three cars).
I loved them for their performance oriented handling and reliability even when they are over 10 years old.
Therefore, CX5 was the first crossover vehicle I researched when I started looking for a bigger vehicle to replace my last Miata.
I did comparison with other make and models over and over and I always came to the same conclusion.
CX-5.
Some competitors were ranked higher than CX5 by Consumer Reports.
However, none of them had better gas mileage or had lower MSRP when equipped similarly.
I went and traded in my Miata for a CX5 after a couple of test drives.
And after 4 months of ownership, I have no regrets. Mazda hit a home run
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After shopping around I decided to buy the 2014 CX-5 Sport/ 6A. This was my first non-American car. I love the car and it has every thing I wanted as standard equip. BUT the car has 4,200 miles and when you sit at a light, trans in gear, engine at idle the car will suddenly lurch forward. It's happened three times. At first I thought I got re-ended, not so. Very dangerous and it could happen at anytime. I believe the trans lock-up converter engages for a split second. I'm trading it in. It's only a matter of time before the trans goes totally bad.
