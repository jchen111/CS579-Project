I bought my car in Oct 2013, and it was ok for about 5 months.  I switched from a Toyota Highlander (which I absolutely LOVED) to save on gas.  While I realized gas savings over the Highlander, I am not getting the gas mileage they promised.  I average 26 mpg tops!

On top of that, my vehicle had to be at the service center on 3 occasions, all for the same problem.  My push button start would not work correctly.  They still haven't fully fixed the problem.

The other problems are road noise and no interior storage, and not enough cup holders, which made for a very long trip with my kids.

All in all, while it has saved some $ on gas, I don't think I would not buy another Mazda again.

I am really, really impressed so far. I switched over from an Infiniti G37 S because I wanted a bit more room with a new baby in the house. It also saved about $90 per month on car payments. I definitely miss the pick up on the G37 but in terms of technology (ease of use and device compatibility) and comfort, the CX-5 blows the G37 away.

Few features that I miss are memory for the driver seat positions (not available) and power passenger seat (not available). But I can definitely live without those and overall the car is excellent.

It handles well, tight steering, comfortable seats, surprisingly spacious for a crossover, and great gas mileage so far.

Have driven my Grand Touring 2014 for 5,000 miles now.
The good:
handles wonderful, brakes are great, visibility excellent, comfort very good. No complaints on build quality, style, or driveability.
It's not perfect but was the best choice for me relative to its competition.
Major surprise is the driveability of car. I did not really expect it. 2.5 is a little beast (that's good).
Major disappointment is the radio, gps, and gas mileage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originally looking at CX9. Dealer said best hoped for mileage would be 22-24.
Needed better. Bought this 2014 as a certified preowned, 6 mos old, 11000 miles. it is the Grand Touring with 2.5 engine.
plenty of power, smooth running, smooth shifting, and best of all great mileage. I was used to a tdi Jetta getting 49 mph. Mazda estimates this engine at 30 combined and 35 highway.
that is exactly what I am getting; and actually closer to 36. I couldn't be happier. Interior room much larger than I had expected. I can carry 4 golf bags and their owners with comfort.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purchased it loaded with everything possible on the 2014 CX-5 Grand Touring. Its gas mileage surpasses expectation at 28.6 city using cruise control when possible. The 2.5 engine is peppy and responds fast, nothing sluggish about this vehicle whatsoever. Thankfully the rear camera doesnt beep at you when in reverse up like a Prius, and inside beep would is so useless. (As if you dont know you are backing up?) The heated seats are nice on cold mornings and warm quickly. The 9-speaker Bose stereo system is symphony quality and quiets any minimal road noise. The navigation (TomTom) is touchy but adequate. I would prefer to see a Garmin navigation system in the CX-5 but that is a personal pref

Ok, I read all of the reviews on all of the RAV4, CRV, Rogue and Escape and I purchased a CX-5 Why? MY wife liked it best, I loved the Escape but it had to much stuff! 15000 commands and I could not program a command, Hmmm. Rav4 just felt old and did the CRV. The Rogue simply was the victim of its own delays and timing, Nissan kept delaying shipments to sell off remaining 2013's so We could not drive and compare a 2014 to the CX-5. 
 Back to the CX-5, 2014 GT runs like it was stolen with the peppy 2.5L and CVT, inside the reviewers got it mostly correct. The NAV is the best once you get past its slow speed. 
P.S. Forester Boring yet capable if you stay awake.

Have owned this car for two months now. Stereo is awful, cabin noise is horrible, it's also very sluggish. The only thing going for it is the looks. Now I'm told the heated seats only work in 63/68 degree temp!!! This was the reason why I bought leather seating. The backup camera doesn't beep when in reverse. I wish I would have chosen the Nissan Rouge instead. The biggest disappointment is the gas mileage, I'm getting about 22mpg, not the 28 suggested!!!!
