Favorite car I have owned so far, and my first Mazda. I purchased it in Feb of 2014, I got the AWD Sport model since I wanted a lease payment under $300 a month - can't say enough good stuff about this car.  I rented one for a weekend previously to see how it was, and took it through a foot of snow in upstate NY without a slip or slide.  It was comfortable and a ton of fun to drive.

I purchased my 2014 CX5 in early 2013. It has 25,000 miles at this time, mostly highway miles. In the last 6 months there have been times when accelerating to pass, the car accelerates to extreme after I have let off the accelerator, and the tachometer flies up as if the accelerator is sticking. The accelerator also flies up while breaking. It is becoming more and more frequent. After reading another review on the same subject, I felt it necessary to confirm the issue. I am very disappointed, as this vehicle was not cheap.

I had a CX-5 as a loaner vehicle a few months back and was really impressed by it.
Had to drive upstate to visit family and snow was predicted, so I wanted an AWD vehicle and it really impressed.

When I decided to buy, I test drove the Sport with the 2.0 liter and was more than pleased with the power.
I ended up leasing a 2014.5 Dark blue with Sand cloth interior with bluetooth.
The mica finish is beautiful and the contrasting cloth interior is really unique.

Recently purchased a 2014 CX-5 Sport AWD, as we were looking to get into the vehicle on a tight budget. So far so good.
Love the ride and handling.
I am surprised so many have commented that the 2.0 L engine is
underpowered; it is not.
Not by a long shot.
Test drove the 2.5 L and 2.0 L and found that the 2.0 L was plenty punchy to get up to speed on the freeway without too much engine groan. This is coming from someone who has driven an overpowered V6 Rav4 for six years.
Its lower cost and better MPG make the 2.0 L a good choice for many.
Just disappointed the Sport is not trimmed out better. Will find out how reliable the vehicle is.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looks great, easily the best looking CUV in the market right now.
I test drove a GT AWD, Touring AWD, Sport FWD and AWD.
The Sport models felt more agile and responsive.
Consequently, I chose a Sport AWD that sat in the parking lot unnoticed (2 miles on the odometer).

The lack of power really only becomes apparent on the highway.
The engine needs to be revved a bit more to squeeze all the available power.
But it does it so smoothly, downshifts quickly, puts a smile on my face each time I hit the gas pedal!
