After much online research (on edmunds and elsewhere) I decided on the CX-5 over the RAV-4 and the CR-V. I based this on horsepower, transmission, styling and fun-to-drive factors.  Leased the vehicle in January, now have over 10K miles. Mostly use it for weekend trips and daily commute. My mileage is at 28 combined which is right about the sticker est. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ok...i'll have to admit that i'm already a little biased with brand loyalty - have had a 1990 protege with 270k before selling it, and still have 2000 626 with 307k going strong.
replaced my 2008 nissan rogue after it's engine blew out and came back to mazda.
bought it last week.
so far, 600 miles, very satisfied.
seats a little snug for me (am 5'11" and 260), but stil comfortable.
adjusting to tom-tom after having garmin for 5 years - slower than my garmin; BOSE sound is very good - i like the ipod connection and pandora.
acceleration a bit sensitive - downshifts quickly, but 10x better than rogue's CVT.
quiet and smooth.
will give update later

I live on a gravel road in the land of snow.
The car managed just fine this winter with our snow, ice and slop.
I did not have any trouble getting up the hill to the house.
I get less mileage than others, as you would expect, given our driving conditions.
Driving along this winter and a piece of the interior plastic below the dash just fell off.
Why?
I don't know.
It is now lying on the counter in my kitchen waiting to be dealt with.
I don't really think that I would buy another one.
Lacking power.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good value. Excellent gas mileage 29 to 35 mpg mixed driving. Acceleration Ok but nothing special. Major rattles and vibrations in cold weather and on dirt roads. Driving side mirror replaced due to vibration at highway speeds. Three trips to dealership(s) to finally resolve instrument panel rattle. Still noticeable body noise and resonance from rear. Thinking of trading in for a Subaru Crosstrek as have driven that car over similar terrain with no problems. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought my CX-5 last summer after doing a lot of research to find a small suv that would get good gas mileage. I thought I had made the right decision but now I'm thinking I made somewhat of a mistake. I like most things about this car, the way it handles and it's comfort and convenience but mine is getting lousy gas mileage. Mazda claims I should get 26/35 but I'm generally only getting 20mpg! Even my dealership was questioning this low mileage. They have checked the car over but found nothing wrong suggesting that I use a better grade of gas. I did so but it made no difference. My BMW 325i I traded got better. I'm really thinking of trading this car as I'm disappointed in Mazda's claims.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Having driven the CX5 for a year I must say Mazda needs to make some changes in my opinion. Handling is very good, fuel mileage is good for the 2.5 and power is pretty decent. Seats are comfortable and driving position has good visibility. Overall not a terrible choice but could be a lot better for the price. Will be looking for a replacement in the next few months.

I've owed this new 2014 Mazda CX-5 AWD Touring for about 5 months now (purchased this year, 2013). I overly like it a lot. I narrowed my choices down from three similar vehicles at the time: Mazda CX-5, the Chevy Equinox and the Nissan Rogue. Here are my current conclusions from this very nice Mazda compact SUV that also feels like a sports car...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was coming off owning a '98 Ford Explorer and owning a 2004 Honda S2000 as my 'fun' car.
Took the Explorer in for a funny noise, got a $3,800 estimate and realized it was time to put the Ford out of it's misery.
The Honda wasn't going to cut it for daily stuff and I still wanted either a station wagon or an SUV, but was really tired of the 15 mpg that the Ford got.
Looked at the Outback and the Escape, but was blown away by the CX-5.
Without repeating what everyone else has said, I'll leave you with this:
The CX-5 AWD with the 2.5 liter Skyactiv engine is 90% of the utility of the Explorer and 95% of the fun of driving the Honda.
I love this SUV/car/CUV vehicle!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The car has a mix of good and bad features.
Not a bad car overall, but probably not the best SUV in this category on the road (at least for me).
It really depends upon what you value in a car.
If you value exterior styling, good gas mileage, and a decent engine you will be happy with this purchase.
If you value technology, ride quality, and comfort (interior components) you will likely be happier with the CRV or Escape.

I drove a Nissan Altima Sedan (2008, 170hp), then an Infiniti G37 Sedan (2010, 330hp). Now I just bought this 2014 CX-5 Touring AWD. I am surprised how Mazda was able to pack in terrific gas mileage in a powerful engine. The comfort in the cockpit is top notch and I love the Bluetooth Phone and Pandora integration. The blind spot indicators are awesome. Makes me feel very safe and confident. The drive smooth and comfy. Huge leg room for everyone in the car (I am 6ft tall). Overall, it is downright amazing. I don't miss my G37 anymore. :)
