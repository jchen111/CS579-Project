I've had my CS w 6 speed manual for about a year now.
It really is a joy to drive - fun, engaging, the steering feel/handling balance is just right.
Sports cars originally were simple, light, rear wheel drive, convertibles.
This is that with the added bonus of being affordable and reliable.
The seats don't seem like they would be comfortable for a long trip, but I was surprised - after a 10 hour drive (with stops) I was just fine.
In comparison my BMW 330i's seats feel much better initially, but wear on me after a few hours.
The trunk is small, but if you buy one of those custom made luggage sets online (mine was about $80), you can fit plenty for a week trip for two.

I've been thinking at some point I am going to come to my senses and realize I've made a huge mistake buying a tiny 2 seat convertible. But then I find myself taking the long way home (again) so I can carve a few more turns with the fall foliage flashing by and the top down. And everything is right with the world. This car actually puts a smile on my face. 
It is an honest car that does what it is supposed to do. If your idea of a great car is one that does everything possible to insulate you from the job of driving walk away now. But if you truly enjoy feeling connected to the road and the machine....give one of these a test drive. On a sunny day. With the top down.
