So I decided I wanted a sports car.  looked at the BMW z4, Mercedes SLK and the Porsche Boxster.  There is no comparison, it's not even close....Box!  I test drove the 911 but it didn't have the same balance as the Box.  I ordered mine with the red leather interior, Agate Gray exterior and 6 speed manual.  I pull down the street heads are turning.  The car is quick. get on the highway with some curves it's all giggles.   I have never driven a car that was just so much spiritual fun.   corners are a blast.  be careful you will catch the car in front and you won't need to slow down because it lives for the curves.  No problem you have the best brakes on the planet.  "there is no substitute"

Just replaced my 2007 Boxster with the 2013. Its a real improvement in almost every way over the previous generation. 

The design of the exterior and interior are significantly enhanced (in particular the interior, which previously I felt had a tendency to feel cheap in terms of
materials)

I know the electric steering has received some criticism, but I cannot tell a difference with the old hydraulic setup. Both are fantastic opinion. 

The only minor difference I've noticed is that the exhaust note in the 2013 isn't as pronounced as the 2007 at lower RPMs. This may be due to the fact that my '07 had the sport / PASM package while the new one doesn't.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally the Boxster is worthy of being named a Porsche. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my 11th Porsche with most being 911's. Always wanted a Boxster but never liked the way they looked until now. The 2013 is stunning in person and is one of the best handling cars you can buy. The base model doesn't have much low end torque so you need to keep the engine between 4500 and 7000 rpm's. It's plenty fast within that range but it brings the mpg to around 18 so you have to choose between power or mileage. You get 30 mpg as advertised with a very light foot. The handling is stupendous, cornering is quick and tight, the car feels glued to the road no matter how hard you push. My last car was a Lotus Elise, which had superb handling, the new Boxster could be better.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just took delivery of my first Boxster, (and first Porsche), which is unlikely to be my last. Mostly very happy with it thus far, not least because I took delivery of a car which I'd ordered to my own specification, that included "only" about $7K in options.
