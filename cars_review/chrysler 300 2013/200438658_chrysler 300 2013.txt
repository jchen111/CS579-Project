For three months, I've had a 2013 300S with the red leather interior, sunroof, nav, and tech package. This is a full-size luxury car with surprisingly good handling for its size and lots of room, and the S model adds an extra flare of style. Don't bother with the cost of the hemi V-8. The V-6 has 300 horsepower (plenty of power for all driving and a little playing) and with the 8-speed transmission I get the advertised 31 mpg on the highway. I've got the rear wheel drive version. You can't beat that for full-size luxury. The Beats by Dre sound system is awesome and it has THE best and biggest touch screen in the industry, hands down. I don't regret this purchase for one second.
