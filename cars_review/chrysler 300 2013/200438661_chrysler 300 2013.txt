I'll rate the car an B-. As for the Uconnect phone system it gets an F. My cell phone is compatable according to the Chrysler website however the connectivity is poor. Phone un-pairs by itself, text box opens and scrolls thru all my contacts without me initiating it and I can get it to turn off after repeatedly pushing the cancel or X button. Takes up to 8 minutes to dial out and get 'not connected' messages. The list goes on. My Buick never had an issue with bluetooth. I've heard everything from "its my phone" to "we'll replace the Uconnect" to "it needs an update". None of which it needs. Forums are loaded with people who have connectivity issues with this system. There is no fix.

After 24 years of never owning anything but two Toyota products at a time, my wife & I intended to replace our 2011 Avalon with another, until we drove a 2013.
Our desire vanished almost instantly and we looked at other manufacturers, including all the 300 comparable models.
The 300 was our last stop and that's the one we bought.

Our dilemma now is whether to buy an extended warranty or not, and if so, from whom to purchase it.
Some say Mopar and some say the deals are better with a third party company.
It would be nice to find a definitive comparison so we could make an informed decision.
We love the car, but don't have a relaxed feeling about reliability...we're both 73 years old.
