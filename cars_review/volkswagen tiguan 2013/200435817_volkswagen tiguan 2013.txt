I test drove everything from Kia to Mercedes before buying the Tiguan, and this was a stand out vehicle from them all.
The solid build quality, quiet cabin and quick turbo engine sold me on this one. It has a "fun to drive" factor that most small suv's do not. There is plenty of cabin room even in the back seat which slides forward and back and/or lays flat for more cargo room. If it weren't for the height and extra room you would think you were driving a GTI. Very sporty, quick and fun! Overall thrilled with my purchase!

I've had my 2013 Tiguan for 2 months now and the new car shine is wearing off.
The car is under powered and lacks any pep.
Conversely, to another reviewers comments about the weird shifting being improved.
It must have been really bad in the past because my Tiguan really shifts weird, especially on hills.
The
Tiguan suffers from an issue in the 4Motion control in that it cannot distinguish between a steep hill and unsafe driving conditions.
The car slows down dramatically taking away acceleration control up/down on steep hills.
Not a car for the mountains!
