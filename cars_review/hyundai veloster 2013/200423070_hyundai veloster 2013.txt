Bought a 2013 Veloster in December 2012.
Never owned a Hyundai anything but was struck with the MPGs, and the tech and sport package as well as the car's design.
Then...problems and more problems.
The car would stall and cut off on me constantly.
Took it to the dealer they "couldn't duplicate the customer's concern" 6 times taken to the dealer! The car would cut off on me on the freeway, surface streets, gas stations you name it it stalled and cut off.
I didn't realize that Hyundai was selling prototypes?
I needed a reliable car...and this ain't it!
Buyback here I come.
Oh, btw beware of the Arbitration clause that you must do if you don't "opt-out" with 90 days of purchase.

I have to say the base veloster is a great car. I'm going from a 2009 Hyundai Elantra and have to say after 4 years Hyundai's styling and build quality has improved. The base engine is fine with six speed automatic and paddle shifters its like having a manual shift car. If you know about cars you would know a mushy peddle means mushy performance. This car has a hard gas pedal so it means the engine has power on tap. I only own it a day and have to say its nibble sporty and does have power on tap. So stop giving this car a bad review, most owners love the car like I do.

This is my first Hyundai after driving Nissan cars for so many years. But I have friends who swear by Hyundai's quality that I finally caved in and bought one. I saw the 2012 model last year and liked it immediately and saw that the price was great too for all the stuff that came with the car. So when I decided to get a new car it was an easy choice. I got the 2013 version on the first Veloster I saw a year ago.
