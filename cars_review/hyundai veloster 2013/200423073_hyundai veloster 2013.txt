I've had my 2014 Veloster for 2 weeks now - and I gotta admit - I LOVE this car!
There's a few weird little things that I'd change about it, but for the money, I am very satisfied with the purchase.
It's styling is cutting-edge both inside and out.
The standard features on a base model impressed me.
It turns heads, and it's fun to drive!
I opted for the 6 speed manual transmission, and I"m glad I did, because with an automatic transmission, this engine wouldn't let this car get out of it's own way.
That aside, the fit, finish, and clean lines remind me of a much more expensive European car - Hyundai did something right with their new models!

I bought a black base with manual adding both the style and tech packages.
I purposely drove it over bumpy roads to see how rough the ride really is.
It really isn't.
I traded in a 2012 Focus with only 12K miles, a tiny Sync screen with very complicated controls, the sh*ttiest plastic hubcaps on 16" tires, and an automatic transmission that made the Ford feel practically epileptic at times.
Very happy with this Hyundai.
Back up camera rocks, Bluelink is nice, Sirius is great, PLENTY of pep in the manual, and overall just a solid, roadworthy feel.
Still getting used to the front end styling, but because of how nice and quiet the interior is, I'm almost oblivious to the eclectic exterior

The Veloster is one of those cars that will turn heads like the Mini Cooper did when it is re-released in the early 2000s. Stylish and different with a next generation interior, this car is fun to own. You will like it, but will probably not love it. Compared to the Mini Cooper, it's performance and handling is terrible. Even with the manual transmission, it is impossible to get enough torque out of the engine to make it fun. That being said, the panoramic sun roof, comfortable seats and great sound system help make this car enjoyable. An improvement in performance and handling is certainly doable. If Hyundai makes this happen, watch out.

I have owned this car for a little over a month and put about 2800 miles on it, and I love it.
After reading (and watching) literally every car review done for this car, I was comfortable with what this car is, and isn't.
I really was surprised by how quiet the ride is.
The suspension is a little firm so you feel the bumps a little more, but it's not too bad.
I also think the engine is perfectly adequate for what this car is intended to be (a sporty looking economy car).
It's not as "underpowered" as a lot of reviews would have you believe.
I also love the bold design of the car.
This shows that you can get something economical without feeling like you're driving a toaster on wheels.

I was looking for on a car: gas efficient (35mpg +), gasoline engine, no turbo, comfortable for 70 miles commute, daytime driving lights, auto on/off headlights, Bluetooth/music streaming with good sound, manual transmission, good warranty, affordable insurance, a different look and most important, a total package for the price. Tested several 2013 models in 4-door and 5-door configurations from all different auto companies; some great, and others not so. I wanted something different. Just when I was about to give up on my search, my wife suggested to test a Hyundai. I have several friends who own them, heard all the good and bad things about it, and yet never consider driving one myself.
