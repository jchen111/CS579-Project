So I really like this car, I've had it sense January and already have about 10k on it. It is a very reliable and durable little car, I had someone t-bone me going 40 and the only damage it had was a little crack and scuff on the bumper. the backseat is also big enough to fit 2 car seats.The gas mileage is better than I expected also, I usually drive between 40-50 mph and I average 38-43 mpg. The highest mpg I've averaged was 51.2 with the Eco boost on. I would recommend this car to a friend and think they should make it in a hybrid because it would get outstanding gas mileage. It also turns heads when I pull up to lights and people surprised its my car and not my parents because of my age.

Test drove several cars from Honda, Scion and Toyota. BORING! Reporters please Stop comparing to a CRX. May I remond you how much you all complained about the styling among other things? The Veloster does many things well and yes it is a quirky car to drive. So what do you get? You get a car that is sporty, different, great gas mileage, huge cargo area, great foot room, awesome features and a blast to drive! It feels much faster than the numbers suggest (though off line is not great) but this is why it turns over those great gas numbers. This car is no Acura, BMW or mini and should not be compared at this price point. I love mine and FYI my other car is a BMW!
