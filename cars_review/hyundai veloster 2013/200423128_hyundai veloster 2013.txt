My girlfriend and I both purchased new Hyundai's last year. Elantra for her, Veloster Turbo for me. After this, we will be trading them in ASAP! Highly disappointed in the dealer and manufacture support with my Veloster's clutch failures. I would assume the company would be paying close attention and offering more support and care for a new model release. Especially during the first couple years as quirks and arising issues are being worked out and brought to their attention. I will say it was a fun experience driving the Veloster Turbo but I can't say that about owning. My lady and I will not buy Hyundai's again after the experience we've been through and financial hardships this car caused
