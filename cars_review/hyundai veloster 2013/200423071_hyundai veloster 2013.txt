I have looked at these for a while and driven several different types of cars, but this little guy is super, my grandbaby has his own back door, the airbags are superior.
The value was great and I love it!!!!!

This is my first Hyundai and so far, it's a mixed bag.
I am in my late 30's and I wouldn't consider myself the intended demographic for a Veloster. 

Pros - The car is fun to drive, handles great, gets about 32 mpg average.
Plus, the base model includes bluetooth, A/C, cruise control, XM and keyless entry.
Just what I needed and nothing I didn't- well done Hyundai.


Cons - There is a constant loud rattle/creaking in the dash/glove box area that is driving me absolutely nuts.
I hate for this to be a reason I don't like driving it, but it's getting to that point. I'm going to see if the dealership can do something at my first oil change.

The 1.6 liter with 6 speed transmission works flawlessly and has all the power I need. It is super smooth and a real joy to drive in the mountains. I get over 40 mpg highway regularly. The touchscreen is VERY nice, and includes a Pandora application so I can stream Pandora from my Android phone via Bluetooth, and it shows the song and artist on the touch screen. I can even skip songs from the control on the steering wheel.
As it has a USB jack, so, I can also charge my Android phone with the cable it came with, nothing extra to buy. My phone connects via Bluetooth and even imports contacts. I can answer and hang up calls from the steering wheel.

I had a Hyundai Accent that was given to me. It was a 98 that I did work on for my daughter. I drove it one day to look at a new one, and saw the Veloster. I didn't know then that I would be buying one in the next few months.
I love the Veloster's handling on the turns, and the great gas mileage, and the 6 on the floor. Everyone looks at it like its from space, and my teens are proud. I get at least 35mpg and I drive long distances to work. It's not zippy from the start, but it accelerates plenty to get up to speed entering the highway. It also turns only 3500rpms at 95, and I wont say what it can do, cause I'll get arrested.
