Just purchased a REMIX Veloster.
Love this car! So far it's been great. First new car in 7 years going from a Hummer H3 to this was a change but a very welcome one. I test drove several competitors and found Hyundai to have the best quality, price, styling and warranties that are fantastic. The dealership was awesome...best new car buying experience ever. I wanted economy and hope to see it soon in my pocket book.
It is not a speed demon...I don't need the tickets either!
It has plenty of power to get up and go. Want more power get the Turbo just save money for tickets! :)

Too many problems, unwilling to fix.
Many times the radio stopped working, finally they replaced it.
The back up sensors constantly beep.
They fixed one, but now it beeps again and they said it's cold outside and that's normal when it's cold.
There is an air flow problem.
When I drive the car and it's cold outside, the temperature with the heat on high is below freezing from the seats down.
The dealership tested and found the temperature to be below freezing, but there is nothing to fix.
Now the keyless entry works half the time, and they won't fix it.
Bottom line, don't buy this car if you live in a cold climate.
Don't pay $28,000 for a car that works 8 months out of a year.
