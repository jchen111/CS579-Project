I love cars and over the past ten years or so I have owned two GMs, one Ram, and four Toyotas.  While not all have been SUVs, there is no question that in terms of quality, construction and reliability, nothing compares to a Land Cruiser.   However, as the LC200 dismal sales indicate, many people do not agree.  

1)  Why pay so much money for a Toyota with bland styling?  

There is no good answer to this question!  If the badge and the styling are the top priorities you are better off with a Mercedes or Land Rover.
