Tucson is a really good car to drive, very confortable and secure. Has a good gas control and powerfull motor.

This is my first small SUV and I love it so far. I have only had the car 3 weeks and things are going fine.
The looks is great, the size is perfect for me and the prices for the GLS model was well worth it especially with all of the additional features that were not available on the Nissan Rogue (my other option). The only
2 bad things I would note for now is the accelaration is a little sluggish but nothing major. The bluetooth does connect to android phones but you cannot control things like you can with and iphone. Overall I am enjoying my new car.
