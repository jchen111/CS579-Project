I have had this Versa Note for less than 3 months with under 1,000 miles on it.
Yesterday I noticed the oil leak spots on the driveway.
The worthless dealership says I have to wait 6 days for an appointment to bring it in.
 If I had known the heap was made in Mexico I would never have bought it.
This leak is due to shoddy, sloppy workmanship.
One more thing, the worthless dealership said they may have to keep the heap overnight!
I don't know which is worse, the dealership or the car.
Meanwhile, I have to keep checking and adding oil for the next 6 days while waiting for the worthless dealership appointment. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I purchased this car in July 2014.
I have spent dozens of hours @ dealerships & talking to Nissan Consumer Affairs. Wasted efforts. Still... I have a navigation system that is defective & has yet to be replaced - seems that since it is such a new car, the parts are hard to come by.
The inside ceiling has come out of the rubber tubing that hold it in place - interior cheap & is uncomfortable in long rides.
Cupholders to close to dash to use. Car has a difficult time in elevations or hills - I turn off the A/C & sometimes use lower gears to make it.
The car is noisy when idling, esp. for such a small engine.
Very crowded.
Storage usage above rear cargo area, blocks rear view. Don't do it
