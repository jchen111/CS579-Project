Have had the car for about 9 months.....gas mileage is as claimed......the ride is more than decent for a car of it's size.......and it handling is very good....i was pleasantly surprised for a car of it's size.....the seats are very comfortable, have taken it on some 4 - 6 hour car trips and did not feel beat to death as I have in some small cars in the past.....all in all,  I am very pleased with the car so far
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This car is the first new Nissan product that I have purchased.
 I have now owned the car for six months and have put 11,000K miles on it.
With that said, I am glad that I chose this car.
I am averaging 38 mpg, most of it commuting 50 miles a day to and from work.
The great fuel economy makes it the right choice for me.
I did drive the car for a couple of months already during the winter and the push button traction control is absolutely wonderful.
Minnesota winters are harsh and it handled the 8+ inches of snow exceptionally well.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We say "surprisingly good" because if one read all the negative reviews...well you get the idea.

 Note's MPG, with usually two aboard, and under all conditions including steep hills and a couple of mountains, is astonishing at 40+ mpg average. 

Car is noticeably quiet and has a nice ride on most road surfaces.
 CVT takes some getting used to but we favor it over regular automatics.
 

Car really rolls (due in part to its low drag figure.)
We found the strength of the car is on the open road--this is no "grocery getter" only,
as described by one dopey reviewer.


So,
car looks good,
is well built, great mpg's, is quiet and rides well.
What more could one want?
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We just bought our 2014 Nissan Versa Note and I have to say it is great.
You can't hear the engine below about 2000 rpm which is the usable economical range.

I am getting about 39 to 40 mpg average by watching the mpg constantly.
Key is 25 inner city and 55 freeway on cruise. 

Lots of interior room except the driver door touches my left leg.
We got the SV model at 500 of base which included everything.

Very easy to park in tight spaces which is something we required.
Has euro styling better than competitors.
I am learning more about this car every day.

Uphill is not good so go 20 to maximize economy.
No sun roof.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great fuel economy, surprisingly quiet for a car in this category, road noise to a minimum, very smooth due to the CVT.
Huge rear passenger space and good cargo space, usually hard to get both but the Versa has it. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only if
you're a car reviewer who is jealous you weren't assigned the Murano convertible to review. It's a small engine car, no doubt, but I have experienced none of the sweaty palm moments reviers warned about entering the interstate. I was leary of the CVT
but acceleration is smooth and there when you need it. Braking is excellent. My only complaint so far is the steering has that mush 70's GM feeling. You don't feel as much close control taking corners, but I find it more than adequate in the city driving I do. Parking in the crowded urban neighborhoods I visit is a snap, and the passenger compartment, especially the back seat, is huge and comfortable. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We got our blue Versa Note on 7-12-13. I have to say we did a lot of research on this vehicle and others, Honda Fit, Hyundai Elantra, etc., what drove us to the new note was it's
claim on fuel economy.
Well after driving it for almost 2 weeks now I can say that there fuel economy rating is pretty spot on, we are getting 34 in the city, and the few times that it has been on the highway we are getting 42 on the highway. I am quite impressed with that. It has a nice quite ride for a car of its size also. The exterior is stylish, but the interior is the same as the versa sedan which bland. But the controls are all easy to get to and work well, the back up camera is quite handy. Updates coming.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Picked up a metallic blue SV with Convenience package four days ago. I will be retiring next year and was looking for something to replace my 2007 Mini Cooper. This rides much better in town & on back roads. Although does not handle as well as the Mini, behaves more than adequately in normal driving, meaning predictably. Has more than enough conveniences for my needs. High in utility--can put my bicycle or a large dog inside & enough room for taking a short trip with my wife. The controls are much more intuitive than the Mini Cooper & easier to use.
