I recently purchased a 2014 Lexus IS 250 F-Sport and the car really exceeds my expectations.
Great look to the car, the interior is awesome and comfortable and it's definitely a looker!
I turn heads all the time.
I previously had an Infiniti and got tired of them.
I looked at the new BMW 3 series but there wasn't anything special about this vehicle until you spend $55K.


Definitely check out the Lexus IS when you are out car shopping.

The car is fantastic. Many improvements compared to the previous model, which in my opinion was not bad at all. In the driving department, in my humble opinion, is a lot better than the current 3 series, specially in the sports mode. Interior comforts and the IT in the car are tip top compared to the europeans. Quality building is typical Lexus and from a design point of view is very innovative (untyplical lexus.... and I would say untypical BMW, MB Audi).
I love the exterior styling, though this is a matter of likes.
