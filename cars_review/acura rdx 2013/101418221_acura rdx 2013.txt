The RDX with a US News Car Rating of 8.5 was chosen over other vehicles with better US News Car Ratings, e.g., Subaru Outback 8.9, Lexus RX350 8.6, etc.
 Other vehicles had better Maintenance plans (60000 free maintenance on Outback) and better interest rates (0% vs. 1.9%)
First maintenance visit -- had to come back to dealer for replacement of damaged sensor wire -- physical inspection of part shows either misassemble or installation error by tool marks on part + I purchased road hazard insurance and was still charged $185.
Car pulls slightly to right after maintenance visit - tires rotated without trueing, rebalance or road check which any reputable tire dealer would hve done

Have had my RDX one month, averaging 25.5 MPG in mixed driving.
Very comfortable, nice interior.
Good for taller folks - we are both over 5'10'.
Great value - cost 6K less than
than a comparatively equipped Volvo S60 - which is the other car I looked at - and the gas mileage is much better.
I got over 30MPG on the highway.
And you never know when the active cylinder management system is in use - it's smooth and seamless.

Great overall vehicle.
Was a little nervous that they moved to electric power steering and took away the SH-AWD, but this car is SUBSTANTIALLY better than the outgoing 2012 model.
The handling is precise and the ride is fantastic....a great balance.
Fuel Economy on premium has been 23-25 MPG's on mixed city/highway use,FWD model.
Pretty stellar for such a powerful 3.5 V-6.
Overall, a fantastic vehicle.
 Even though some key features are missing (will explain later), you CANNOT get any car in this price class with this amount of standard equipment.
 Test drove BMW X3, Mercedes GLK and Audi Q5, and neither has the ride quality/handling balance that this car has, AND for thousands less

Very pleased to find this much power with good gas mileage.
Quality is excellent and the car looks great - I especially like the basque red.
The cylinder deactivation system is flawless - you can only tell when it is in use by watching the digital bar graph for mileage jump from 20 to 30+.
Initial impressions on gas mileage are 19-20 in pure city and 27-28 for all highway.
May get a bit better with more miles on it.
Car is too new to evaluate reliability - I gave it a 5 since my 98 acura integra has 212k miles on it and has been reliable.

Jumping to RDX from 2000 Sienna was a change. I was looking forward to new technology.
