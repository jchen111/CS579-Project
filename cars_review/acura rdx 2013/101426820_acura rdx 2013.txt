This is my 6 or 7th Acura and it will be my last. The buying experience, with a dealer that I have used for 15 years was not great, switched leasing companies on me and I did not even realize it. Cost me 15,000 extra miles. That said, my wife is the primary driver on this but I drive it on weekends. The car it twitchy, touch the wheel and you are all over the place. Tranny? Upshift, downshift, really annoying. The build quality is Acura but honestly, the interior is cheap, the bluetooth is a step below my 2010 TL and there are so many choices in the small cross over/small SUV market that I would never get another one of these. I was this close to getting a Murano and wound up with the Acura.

I have had my RDX for 1 year and 19,000 miles.
After the first few months of owning it i noticed a vibration between 2nd and 3rd gear and 4th and 5th gear.
I brought the car to the dealer and had a technician ride with me so I could point it out.
The vibration, the dealer stated, is due to the deactivation of cylinders and that it is minor with no fix.
This is not minor when you spend many hours driving.
A vehicle that is considered a "luxury" suv should not be vibrating.
The gas mileage is not as stated.
I average around 19mpg.
I drive about 50/50 highway/town.
The dealer replaced my bluetooth mic but that did not improve.
I can hear fine, people have a hard time understanding me.

I've been driving my Acura RDX AWD for about 5 months and I'm really happy with the car. Performance and comfort aside it's generally the best looking car in any crowded parking lot. Looks matter and the RDX (post 2012) looks better than most luxury SUVs.

Got it new in February 2013 and while my wife drives it daily, I do drive it on weekends. It is solid, ride if good, plenty of power and gas mileage has been pretty good. The blue tooth is not very good, in fact
I have had Acura's since 1996 and the one that I just traded, a 2010 TL had a blue tooth that was lots better. Cannot speak a phone number unless it is tagged, makes no sense, especially when you only get 15 tags. Giant step backwards on that one. Car is very good in the snow/rain. Have never driven a Lexus or BMW X3 but I would have to say that this Acura seems perfectly fine with typically Acura build quality

I've owned my 2013 RDX for about 6 months now.
You're going to get what you expect from an Acura ... good performance and reliability.
I'm getting about 18mpg, less then I expected ... but no highway driving.
Last month my wife spent more and got herself a 2013 Volvo XC60.
I'm jealous ... wish I'd spent a little more and got the Volvo also.

I have had 6 Acura's and have come to expect a certain level of quality from them. My last one before the RDX was a '10 TL. Although I was not crazy about the styling, the car flew, handled well and the interior had a style to it. I have had the RDX for about 2 weeks now and the over riding feeling that I get is that it looks and feels cheap inside. Plastic all the way through, even the sun visors feel thin. The blue tooth is a giant step backwards from what I had in the TL, it makes zero sense. I got this car for my wife to negotiate the snow in the NE because the TL was not very good. I looked at the Murano and honestly, it is a nicer car inside.

I have had my RDX (AWD, Base) for 6 months.
It is fun to drive and very comfortable.
Previously I had a 2001 Toyota Highlander Ltd.
I looked at the MDX (too large) and the X3 (too costly) and finally decided on the Base/AWD RDX.
Wanted some of the features of the Tech Package but decide not worth $4K for the.

I almost did not buy the car because it was missing some key features I expected in Luxury/near luxury-brand SUV
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I own a 2013 RDX .
Ordered to get model and colors, have no need for navigation.
If considering this car make sure to take an extended test drive and check to make sure the features you normally expect are there.
I have owned over 50 autos and this is the worst mistake I've made since the Oldsmobile diesel.
Ride is fine on highway if you don't encounter pot holes, small bumps or rough pavement.
Even crawling over a speed bump makes the front suspension sound as if it's coming apart.
Embarrassing if you have passengers as they will think something is broken.
The front passenger seat has no "up" adjustment.
My wife hates riding "in the hole".
Uses cushion!, in Honda's premium brand?.

Purchased brand new RDX 2013, 10 miles down the road check VSA, check AWD, check power steering, and other warning lights started flashing.
After stopping and restarting car light went off.
Came back on a week later, could not accelerate > 40 mph without car automatically braking.
Dealer replaced left wheel sensor, no more problems yet, but have lost faith.
Asked dealer for free all weather mats for my trouble / inconvience but they would do nothing for me.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As an owner of an '08 RDX and a '13, I can tell you the ride quality is much better, don't let the harsh reputation of the outgoing model discourage you.
It's also not a floaty car, if you want that, go with a Lexus, or '70's-'80's Cadillac.
Despite my very heavy lead foot, averages 21 mpg in heavy city/stop & go driving.
This is not a CRV as another commenter/troll said, who clearly does not own any RDX.
Uses premium gas, don't listen to a) the sales guy or b) someone who thinks they know better that the teams of engineers that designed it.
Brakes are a bit touchy.
Materials quality not on par with MB/Audi, but also not priced like MB/Audi.
