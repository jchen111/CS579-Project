I bought a 2013 RDX wanting it to be a great choice for a luxury CUV.
I walked away in April 2014, traded it for a BMW X3.
Performance: numb steering, terrible suspension (failed, under warranty), failed engine mounts producing excessive vibration, unstable at high speed. Tech package: mediocre with Atari graphics. Sunroof: constantly malfunctioning. Build quality: Terrible cheap plastic all over, exposed sound attenuating foam where the windshield meets the dash, no rear passenger vents, the poorest quality leather i've ever seen in a car, and NO dash cover under steering column (where you can feel wiring and more sound attenuating foam), Playskool key FOB, hollow doors. Avoid this car!!

I have owned my 2013 RDX for a year and a half and have 14,000 miles on it. This is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. On long trips I can be in the car for 4-5 hours and not be stiff.
The gas millage is very good for the size of the vehicle. The VCE goes from 6 to 3 on the freeway allowing for good millage on longer hauls. If I went 60-65, I could pull 29 MPG on standard hauls (no major mountains). City/Highway combo I get 22-24.

I have owned many luxury vehicles over the years, when I initially came across the 2013 RDX I thought that I had discovered a true bargain. This , however, was not the case. The reason TRUE luxury vehicles cost more is because they are worth it. The RDX has flaws that I can over look but the wind noise from the doors and b pillars is simply unforgivable in a vehicle in this range. The dealer has done what it can but they cannot redesign the vehicle. Acura must be aware of this issue and I believe is simply choosing to ignore it. Had I taken a more extensive test drive I would not have purchased the vehicle, so...shame on me. I will unload the vehicle asap and accept the loss and move on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They disregard the new car warranty. I bought a new RDX six months ago and it has 5,000 miles. This so called luxury vehicle bounces more than a Magic Mountain ride, even in flat surfaces. The service technician agreed that it has a rough ride, yet the dealer did not even put it in a hoist to check if the suspension is loose. I get a headache every tim I drive it. Acura customer service considers the rough ride to be normal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have had my RDX for over a year and 17000+ miles. Overall I like the car especially when I was averaging 23+ mpg. Over the last several month my mpg has dropped to 21, still not bad. I have had it to the delearship for a full synthetic oil change. I also had to pay for a front wheel alighment which was needed. I have upgraded my gas to Chevron on their advice but it has not made a difference.
I noticed that the 2014 MDX has the same mpg ratings and now has touch screen controls which I miss on my old Pioneer flat panel. I also agree that I do not feel like I am riding in a luxury car.
One serious problem which I took to the dealer was tire slippage when turning from a stop. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The RDX is worth the $35-40K price compared to other luxury SUVs. The ride and performance of the 2013 model is excellent--see Consumer Reports. However, the Navigation Sys. is not worth the price. Unless you are an audiophile, the Tech Pkg. is not worth $4K. Buy it without, then get a good Garmin GPS of $100+. You will like it better.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have close to 11k miles on my RDX. I wanted an SUV that was fun to drive and yet got better gas mileage than my 2011 Highlander. I know I did not need the size of the MDX. I call my RDX my high performance sports car. The gas mileage has met my expectations. I mainly drive in the city and am averaging 23-24mpg. The only complaint I have is the tires losing traction while turning from a stop. This makes me wish I had opted for the AWD. I believe that the naviagtion system is too cumbersome having to press too many buttons. Further the car designers could have opted for more flair. The RDX is rather bland.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Has great pick up and shifts smooth as I would have expected.
My previous car was an Acura TL 2006 which I really liked.
Voice commands for phone, navigation, audio, etc. is not real user friendly.
Too many commands to be used.
It was easier to use voice commands with the bluetooth in the TL without navigation.
Disappointed in gas mileage.
Sticker states estimated 20 city and 28 hwy.
My first tank of premium fuel with combined 60 miles of hwy driving and the rest city only got 17.5 mpg.
On my 2nd fill up I traveled to the dealer & back today approx. 120 miles hwy & it shows average of 23mpg.
Not what I expected. My 2006 TL got 20 city & 28-30 Hwy consistently.

If you enjoy a ride that resembles rocking about in an earthquake or jerking your way through an amusement park ride then the 2013 Acura RDX will bring you joy; otherwise, steer clear. The ride experience in this small SUV category is disappointingly uncomfortable and requires full attention from the driver in an effort to keep the vehicle in the lane. This ride is as far from relaxing as any ride could possibly get these days. Acura, you've failed me.

We bought this for my wife to drive. She was driving a 2012 Honda Pilot. In the past few years she has had a Honda CR-V, Lexus RX350 and a Honda Pilot. The comfort and quite has impressed us the most.

I researched the 2013 RDX hard before we made our decision. Great choice. All of the websites said the the average price paid (TMV) for this model was a little over $37K. I was able to get it just a little under $36K.

I would compare this to a Lexus RX350, it's a little smaller, but about $9K less.

Great decision....
