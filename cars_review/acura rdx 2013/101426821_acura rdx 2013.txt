I've had my 2013 RDX since January, purchased used with 30K, got a great deal and it looked brand new.
Prior to my Acura I had a Honda Accord V6, amazing car, then purchased a 2008 Lexus IS250 and what a nightmare!
Car was beautiful, eye catching, but at 30K engine oil rings and pistons needed to be replaced, car was burning oil, fortunately all covered by Lexus!
Once the car hit 100K and after several repairs it was time to unload and get back into a reliable Honda/Acura!
My next car will be an Acura again!
As I read reviews people complain about this attractive SUV, what most people don't see if the reliability of Acura's and overall value!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have been driving my RDX AWD w/Tech for 7 month now and really like the car.
Plenty of power and I find it to be a great value for the cost.
My only issue with the car is the poor quality of the navigation system.
It is like using DOS commands on a PC.
A million things to remember and it take 5 minute to enter an address.
I am shocked Acura put it out there for use like this.
Otherwise the car is good but it is hard to overlook a Navi system so frustrating I don't even us it unless I have no other choice.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After 8 months or so with my RDX AWD tech these are my thoughts.
My gas mileage stinks, I am averaging about 19 all around . But to be fair I live and work on Las Vegas BLVD and the traffic and amount of traffic lights are insane.
No storage for my jumper cables or any cubbies to hide stuff.
Gas tank way too small, needs another 2 or 3 gallons in size.
Navi works good but it takes 5 minutes to tell the navi what to do, and it does not understand street names and you need to repeat it 5 or 6 times quite often.
Cornering is no BMW but it is much smoother riding but still competent.
Acceleration is amazing, but it will empty your tank fast if you enjoy it.

Nice, elegant car but looks like suffering from cost-cutting. At 3k miles battery went (luxury car with low cost battery) - the GPS needs redesign, it looks and feels obsolete and the voice recognition does not work well - Bluetooth low voice quality.
Ride excellent - engine, tranny ok after 8k miles.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After ten months and 22k miles I love this vehicle.
It's super comfortable, quiet and has a stable ride on all kinds of roadways.
On extended interstate trips I get over 30 mpg.
The back-up camera is fantastic.
There's excellent space in front, back and cargo area.
All the basics are well done: it's a great value.
So, what's not to like.
The onboard navigation system is effectively useless.
Too dated and too many basic destinations not in the database--or not findable.
Voice recognition just doesn't stack up even if you can remember the hundreds of commands and proper syntax.
And you can't make adjustments to the route while driving.
I now use my old Garmin portable GPS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vehicle was great on a test drive - until it had to be used for everyday living. It is not built for drivers under 5'10" or maybe 5'8". The materials used for the interior are not of luxury vehicle quality. 

The excessive noise from the brakes and transmission are horrendous. After being looked at twice by the dealership, I was told that these are characteristics of the vehicle. Stay away!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a year and two road trips, here are my general impressions.

Pros:
Great mileage (28 mpg on the road), comfortable ride, good acceleration, good audio system, good dash/control layout, great ergonomics.

Cons:
Interior finish uninspiring, fit and finish from factory not in the same class as other luxury brands, rear hatch can only be opened with dash control after all the doors have been unlocked. 

We've had the car in for two fit and finish repairs.
It took the dealer three tries to a problem with the front bumper cover coming loose from fender (dealer didn't want to replace broken cover).
Then the passenger roof rain gutter molding was loose, causing a horrible vibrating noise.

I am the owner of RDX for six month and I am quite disappointed. Reading other reviews seems like I am driving a different car and I'd like to share my view to help future buyers understand what they are buying. In one sentence: Acura does not belong to the club of Audi, BMW, Lexus or Mercedes, do not compare RDX to Q5, X3 and do not read reviews that attempt to do so. 

Main complain: whoever designed this car never drove in it. I've bought top of the line model and it is missing basic features that come free in Toyota.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's comfortable, fast, and has a good amount of room in the front and rear. Also has nice simple, but solid, cabin features. It's very good in pretty much every area -- which almost makes it feel a little boring to talk about.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a great SUV and a winner in the market place. But being an Acura its missing minimum luxury features; mid/upper vents for rear passengers, LED tail lights, blind spot monitoring. The guts are a smash hit; motor, size, AWD, cargo space, 6 speed trans.
