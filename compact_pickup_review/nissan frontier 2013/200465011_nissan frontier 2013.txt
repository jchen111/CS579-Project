I bought this to tow our 3,500 lb Casita travel trailer.
We added a Leer Cap.
We have a 2013 crew cab SV with 4.0 2WD and 5-speed auto.
 The 265 HP is more than adequate and beats our old BMW X5 3.0 by at least 30 HP.
Steering at highway speeds is vague and it wanders, but I noticed the tires are wearing on the inside and I believe the factory set the front-end with too much toe-out.
The headlight aim needs adjusting, too.
The sterro is OK, but the iPod starts by itself sometimes for no reason.
We added add-a-leaf springs to the back for towing, as it sagged a bit when loaded.
Overall, it was about what I expected for a $25,000 vehicle.

I had this truck for about 7 mths now.
Bought new. It is a rugged little truck.
I say little even though it's consider as a mid size truck. On the out side it gives the illusion that it's has a roomer interior.
Nissan could have made it a few in wider and added a few in of leg room for back seat passengers. 1 week after having the truck I exp. a loud clanking noise during start ups, and while driving until the engine warmed up.
The dealer tried to tell me it was normal but turn out to be a loose cooling fan.
Now my driver's side window makes scraping noise when the window is let up or down.
Looks like I need a new regulator. Other than that it's a great truck, but with bad gas mileage.

So far I like it. Toyota 2wd sat low. Rear seats are better than Toyota too. Love the blue metallic exterior color. Too new and too early to review gas mileage. Think it will be fine. Does not seem to be thirsty. 3rd Nissan truck I've owned. First crew cab, with V6 5A. When I'm not driving my Nissan truck, I'm a driving a FedEx truck. My Nissan Frontier handles well at highway and interstates, no problems.
