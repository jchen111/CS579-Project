Have been very pleased with this vehicle except for 2 items: The projector low beam headlight is designed so that it is very difficult to see at night.
(Appears Ford attempted to design a way to not blind oncoming drivers...their design limits the drivers vision as if the top 1/2 of the beam had been cut off.)
Secondly, when you roll down the back windows, one or both, there is a VERY loud wind vibration noise.
The result is that you MUST also roll down one of the front windows or roll the back windows up.
The sound is intolerable otherwise.
Otherwise, I love the car.
