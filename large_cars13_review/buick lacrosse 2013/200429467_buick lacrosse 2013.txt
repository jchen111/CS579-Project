We bought our 2013 Buick LaCrosse Touring about three weeks ago and have put about a thousand miles on it.
Engine is crazy smooth.
Transmission is slick.
Interior is just perfect.
The car is super quiet.
The ride is supple, although I'm really enjoying sport mode, which instantly stiffens the ride.
Electronics are going to take a while to master, for sure, but the Harmon Kardon sound system is incredible.
Don't forget to set Surround Sound.
Back seat is second to none.
Trunk space is decent and the fold down seats have already come in handy.
Our color is Summit White.
Gotta get it special order, but worth the wait.
Heated steering wheel is cool and the HUD is a nice feature.
