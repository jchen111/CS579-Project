During the last 20 years or so Dodge has definitely been busy designing and building cars that exude visceral appeal!
The 2014 Charger SXT is just such a car!
It's rated at 300 hp with an 8 spd tranny that is rated to deliver 31 mpg hwy.
On a short test loop I recorded an average of 35 mph with little more effort than avoiding hard throttle application, and managing my approach to stop lights - I would say Dodge's numbers are accurate for those who actually drive to conserve fuel.
The Charge is a full-size, 4-door...spacious interior, very well laid-out instrument panel with large 8.4" touch screen display, Garmin Nav system...pretty much all the bells and whistles.
