Just got my 13 Charger R/T 2 weeks ago. I was driving a 02 GTP turbocharger. Boy what a difference in comfort and drive! I am totally loving my Charger with all the bells and whistles. The seats are so comfortable I can't wait each day to get in and drive. My GTP was a great car and had turbo so it went pretty fast but the Charger just goes by instinct. All I have to do is say "go" and we are off. I can't say much more about this car except it is awesome and looks pretty dang sexy! My only complaint is the sound system. I love my music and love it loud and thumping. The sound system in the car just doesn't do that well. Will be adding additional sound equipment to get the sound I want.

Traded my VW Jetta for this baby! All I had was 4 cylinders with a max of 170 HP, to upgrade to 370 was awesome! Almost 400 ft lbs torque is simply sensational. The Uconnect 8.4 inch screen was easy to use, Beats sound system is great, cooled and heated leather seats are comfortable, remote start is a favorite. It's a dream to drive, I don't get passed up all the time anymore, just put my foot down and I'm instantly thrown back in my seat and I'm gone! MPG is a bit low as I'm averaging about 18-20 MPG but I do kind of have a lead foot but with this car, who wouldn't?! Definitely a keeper

I bought my R/T with Road & Track package in Feb 2013. Options on the car are Nav and forged aluminum wheels. Color is Redline with red interior. 
I knew I was interested in the R/T with Road & Track. When I saw the Redline Red with red interior, I was partially hooked. Now I had to test drive. The test drive (one hour) sealed the deal!!
After driving nearly 11,000 miles, this car is excellent, fun to drive, solid build.
I get 21mpg to 21.5 on my commute to and from work and get 25mpg on the HWY.
I get weekly compliments on the car, the color, the interior and the wheels.
If the dealer would have had an SRT8 other than black....I think I would have bought it!!!

I thought I was crazy trading my MB GLK350 in for a Dodge.
I can say right now it was definitely worth it.
The car is built as solid as my MB and has better technology and a lot more personality.
Don't know if the service will be as good but hope I never find out.
Between the rebates I got this car for $30.5K.
The car has plenty of pickup and so far I have not noticed that this car only has a 5 speeds.

Lots of fun to drive with the R/T plus. Good balance of handling and comfort for those who commute and don't want to race this beast. Acceleration is awesome and fun, although its so quick you need to take it on a race track to really see what that Hemi can do. Long commutes getting 23 mpg, long freeway trips 25 mpg. Cruising in this car is a delight, quiet and cozy seats, good sound (no beats upgrade) and loud enough. Rear visibility is poor, but with the rear view camera backing up is easy. Blind spot is huge, but with the side mirror proximity sensors light, you get that warning that somebody is in your blind spot. My opinion is that that these two technologies are important.

We purchased our 2013 RT Road and Track several months ago. Coming from the muscle car era and not having anything to show for it,
decided to purchase my wife and I a new age one. Our vehicle is fully loaded accept for the radar speed control. This baby is black on black and is a true head turner. The Road and Track package gives the car a stiffer ride but for us old dragsters it is not bad. Hands down this is the most beautiful sporty road car inside and out and boy does she fly! Not bad on gas either:}
