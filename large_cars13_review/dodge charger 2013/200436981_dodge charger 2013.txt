I now have about 5,600 on "White Lightning".
I still look forward to every day that I can jump into this awesome machine and drive anywhere at all.

I frequently have people at gas stations, parking lots, and drive-throughs comment on how gorgeous she looks.
Turns heads everywhere.

I still LOVE the 6.4 liter Hemi with 470 hp.

What I love almost as much as the power is the safety-tech features.
The Blind spot warning and back-up assistance with cross traffic warning is AWESOME!!
They have worked flawlessly and prevented at least one accident so far.

I now have over 4,000 miles on this
Beast.
Over 2 tons of American muscle, however, it consistently gets 0 to 60 times of 4.6 to 4.7 seconds.
Build quality is superb.
Better than my 4 previous Acuras and 1 prior Lexus.
Base sound system is wonderful.
I have not found a single flaw or problem with it yet.
The 6.4 liter hemi that puts out 470 hp is beyond description.
Acceleration is so wonderful that I am addicted to it.
Every day I wake up eager to drive this incredible vehicle.
My son has a 2012 Challenger SRT8 with the same 6.4 liter hemi.
His experience is the same.
Like me, me plans to drive his SRT8 forever.
