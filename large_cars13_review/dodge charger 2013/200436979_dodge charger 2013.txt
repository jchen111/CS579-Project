As long as I'm making the correction to the model, I'll add some additional thoughts.
I can't imagine any complaints on the Hemi other than the mileage. If you want great MPG, why buy the Hemi? My mixed driving MPG is 19.7.
Highway MPG is 25.1. I believe this will improve as the car breaks in but I see little chance of the 30+ that some are claiming.
Using regular gas gives me a 15% cost advantage over the small turbos I drove in the past so given the breathtaking performance, gas mileage is fine.
I imagine a 10 - 15% improvement when the 8 speed is available later this year.
On the road the ride is glass smooth & Lexus quiet. With the monster sound system the trips all seem shorter.
