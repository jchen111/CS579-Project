 I have been a happy Toyota customer all my adult life (now 55 and had only one non-toyota).
I am very frustrated with this car.
I suppose if one has low expectations, then this is the car for you..I feel like a sucker for purchasing it..
I feel like I have a 'super Corolla',... not at all the car I wanted to give my wife.
We purchased this car for long rides, and I only see this being acceptable for around town.
Toyota has taught me a lesson I will not forget.
It seems to me that Toyota has left the upscale market, and is leaving that for Lexus' territory.
Seriously, I'm not being too harsh.
Check it out for yourself.

2013 Avalon does not not feel like a $35,000 premium sedan. The ride is busy because even small road imperfections are felt and heard.
There's no sound insulation under the carpets or in the doors so the road noise level is high like being in a Corolla. The front seat bottoms are small in size and thinly padded.
So my seat bottom gets sore after only 20 miles of highway driving.

The only "premium" car qualities that the 2013 Avalon has are rock solid directional stability on the highway, a smooth, quiet and responsive engine and transmission, and a fairly luxurious looking and feeling interior.

I knew this was the car as soon as I sat in the drivers seat for a test drive. I got the pearl white and tan interior with chocolate accents.. Amazing car. I constantly put customers in my car and being 6'4"
in any other car the person behind me never had room. Not they have a good 4" of extra leg room. Not the fastest car but it isn't the slowest. I do not have the navi because I have owned toyota's before and they have never really had good ones, and with cell phones who really needs it...

Previous Avalon owners will be shocked at how harsh the ride of 2013 Avalon is. Small bumps are transmitted as sharp kicks into the cabin. Road noise is also pronounced on worn asphalt roads. The style of the car makes a rear view camera a must, however its an option. the camera is standard on the Honda accord. Headlights also have a sharp cutoff that makes reading some road signs difficult. The touch sensitive switches make it to easy to activate the wrong control.

Before anything else, let me say this "this is the third Toyota I owned and drove more than 160,000 on my previous two without any breakdown or problem even a minor one. 
I looked for a comfortable full size sedan for my family with two kids instead of a minivan or SUV due to MPG issue. I decided to purchase an Avalon XLE after test drive of Ford Taurus, Nissan Maxima & Infinity G37..So far I confidently say I made a right choice. The car handling may not be as sporty as the Infinity, inside its cabin we can really enjoy the quality of the Bluetooth audio system because it is so quite thanks to the use of noise reduction glass & its air drag coefficient of 0.28.

The car rides great and looks great but I have a few suggested improvements. The drivers seat has very hard side panels, why are they not the same consistency as the center sections?

Bought
a beautiful 2013 Toyota Avalon. Two weeks later noticed what appears to be defective piece on the dashboard. Toyota Corp and the dealership do not want to fix. Bought car 50 miles away from home and local dealership ask where I bought car from. 

The moral of this post is, dont buy car at night and make sure you love every inch when you drive it off the lot as Toyota is not really willing to stand behind any defect they may have left you with. Good product, Poor Customer support. 

Toyota should learn how to stand behind there product better!
