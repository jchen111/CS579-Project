Although this is a great car, it comes up short on one item I think most Avalon Limited buyers want and that is COMFORT.
I know they are trying to reach the younger set and apparently have done so from sales figures, I believe they went too far on ride/comfort.
We purchased our Avalon Feb 2013 and just had it in for 15,000 mile service. 
We take a 400 mile
trip about once a month.
On the first trip in Feb 13 I noticed at the 100 mile mark that I couldn't get comfortable in the seats - felt hard.
I didn't say anything, but the next month my wife(its her car) said these seats aren't comfortable.
She said the other day I want a new car - one that has comfortable seats and softer tires.

I just leased this car this past weekend. Looked at Impala, Taurus, 300, ES350 and Toyota Avalon. Decided to get the Avalon after driving the cars. The car handles great. Did not feel like past reviews that car was too stiff or noisy on highway. I will update this if it changes.

I bought the Avalon Touring XLE model in March 2013. Initially, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the ride. I thought there was too much road feel.
This October, I drove it to Ohio and Indiana from Florida. It performed amazingly and
I am now smitten with this machine.
I really enjoy driving it and on a smooth road, it is terrific.
I am averaging nearly 30 mpg . My driving is all at 60mph where I live . No regrets on this purchase.

I live in Alpharetta Ga and recently purchased a 2013 Avalon Touring Edition.
I'm enjoying the car. However; I'm very disappointed with the dealership for customer "No Service". I took my car in for it's 5k servicing. A clip to the back panel of my drivers seat was faulty and the panel is coming off. I was told to come back tomorrow and they would repair it.
When I drove back the next day, I waited 45 minutes for them to tell me they don't have one but will in a week. They would call me.
They didn't. I call again, left message with service technician to call me. He did not. Called again. Part not in until October 24. Mind you it's August 29th.

This is my "highway" car.
Drove to NEPA Pocono Area with my electronic drums in the trunk. The July shakedown cruise to our yearly SummerJam proved the Avalon's capability.
I tend to travel fast (above the speed limit) and got almost 30 MPG while feeling safe and in control.
Love the transmission and the steering and despite what MT may say about "steering feedback" I didn't find that a negative since I didn't want a "sports car" 
or want to "feel the road".
Spent almost three weeks driving around the N.E.P.A. area roads that I grew up driving on (I live in Tampa), these are what we call "driving! roads".
Again, the car made it a blast - it went everywhere like it owned the road.

A new car and the Headliner is already peeling, the dealership gave no explanation and said they have ordered a new one, seriously is this new Toyota standards. Cabin noise is too much on the highway. Took to my dealer, the supervisor of the service center said cabin noise was normal. For a high end car which is comparable to the Lexus ES350 I think the cabin noise is too much and Toyota must do something about it. Anyone else who has the Avalon please put your reviews on NHTSA.gov and Edmunds. AT 75 mph I hear a lot of wind noise around the car and at one point there was a lot of noise coming from the front windshield and Toyota and the dealership are not willing to fix it.

I am on my fifth and possibly last Toyota.
The changes they have made have all been a huge disappointment.
Toyota changed the navigation and it is a huge step backwards.
We have only had the car for three weeks and are looking to sell it already.
It is a beautiful car but not worth the price.
Car has too much technology and makes it complicated to use.

 Recently bought this fine vehicle and almost didn't because of harsh suspension response when impacting large road patches and other road irregularities. Drove another car before the one I took home for the little woman to see and drive. Both cars had 18" Michelins and were disappointing in the way they reacted to serious road imperfections. Driving the car I ultimately bought decided to check the tire air pressure. All tires checked just a little shy of 40lbs. Obviously being over inflated by at least 6lbs will cause the ride problems I noticed.
With the correct tire pressure the over all ride improved drastically. I would suggest before you road test one check the air pressure.

Nice car for the money. Bought at CarMax in Laural, MD. They gave me $3000 off MSRP. Worth every penny~
Drove it back home to PA and avg 28 mpg on the trip. Avg'ing 24 in mixed driving. 
Very sporty to drive, roomy, gorgeous interior, seats were a little hard but everything else was spot on.
Love this car!
I researched cars in the $33000 - $35,000 price range with NO cvt trannsmission and this was easily the best car in the price range. I test drove them all. The Honda Accord Touring was my 2nd fav.
