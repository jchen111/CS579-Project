I was very excited to purchase my new Jeep. That changed! I haven't even had my brand new car 3 months and it is already in the shop. It has been in there over a week. It has died on me five times already. The dealership cannot figure out what is wrong. I've heard nothing but good things about Jeep, but I am thinking I should have kept my old car that I had NO problems with. Not a happy customer at all.

This is one of those vehicles that you have to see in person. The pictures don't do it justice. It is a beautiful car and drives like a much more expensive vehicle. Fuel economy was one of the main reasons for considering it(as well as the looks). We are averaging 27.5-28.5mpg combined and on the interstate/highway we average 29.5mpg. We have never averaged less than 26mpg. It has handled great in the snow and ice even though it's only FWD. It has one of the most comfortable rides that I've experienced while test driving other crossovers. The 2014 Cherokee is an amazing vehicle and has an overall great personality. If you're looking for a new crossover, you should definitely check it out!
