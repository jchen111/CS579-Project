My Jeep is now just over 3 months old (4k miles) and has visited the dealership with major problems twice.
First, the transmission shifts in low gears are terrible; not what you would expect from a new vehicle.
A software updated reduced, but did not fix the issue.
Second, the electrical system in the car is suspect.
It went haywire on me.
The windshield wipers turned on and couldn't be stopped, the turn signals went out and the odometer was flashing non-stop.
Of course, by the time I reached the dealership it was asymptomatic, so I was basically told, to bad, bring it back broken.
Hopefully next time the electrical goes out nothing more serious occurs. Buyer beware on this vehicle.
