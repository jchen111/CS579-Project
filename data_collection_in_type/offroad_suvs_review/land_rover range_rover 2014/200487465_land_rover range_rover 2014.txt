Long time owner of RR's.
Just sold my 2006 SC edition and it was the best car I have ever owned.
Reliabilty throughout my ownership was stellar. Never had a significant issue.
I currently also own a BMW 750 and 650.
And have owned other premium vehicles in the past. And as I said the RR was the best of the lot.
I just took delivery of a 2014 full size RR SC with every option except the towing package.
This is by far the best RR. It's fast, comfy and execution in materials and fit/finish is flawless.
I love it.
That being said, there are a few areas of improvement needed.
Should be no Eco auto on.
Navigation could be improved. And rear hatch cover can be improved. Great SUV!
