I just got the 2.4 automatic Compass Limited last week.
It's a fleet vehicle, didn't have a choice so didn't test driver one. 
Picked up the car one evening, didn't do anything but drive home 5 miles.
Woke up the next morning and the remote access buttons on the key did not work, used the key, got in, started the car and the radio wasn't working either.
All kinds of similar issues.
I'm sure that can be fixed but the biggest problem is the engine/powertrain.
The vehicle does terrible when you try to accelerate to change lane or merge, pulls to the point of almost losing control.
I drove a '12 Escape with a 2.5 engine, much more powerful engine.
