Got my 4 door wrangler 3 mos. ago with the altitude package (blacked out trim). I get compliments everywhere on how cool it is. Manual trans shifts smooth and precise and makes the car extremely fun to drive.  Gas mileage on highway can be 26 if I set the cruise @ 60; 16-19 in the city. Leather seats are very comfortable; ride is great; car is quieter than I thought it would be. dual top option gives you a nicer soft top. Radio/nav/Bluetooth controls are very intuitive. Dealer gave me a great price, so it made no sense to buy a used one.

I was reluctant to trade my 2012 Wrangler 2 door for the Dragon Edition but my family wanted the comfort and convenience of the 4 door and, after all, I would still have a wrangler.
After a few weeks and a few hundred miles I can honestly say that it was a great decision.
The ride is better than the 2 door on the highway.
This Jeep has an upgraded suspension and gets more attention than even my "Crush" 2 door.
The 18" wheels get lots of looks too.
The creature comforts are easy to get used to and the MPG remains 22+ on my 25 mile round trip daily drive. Great room and new folding back seats are great. Of course I added my Warn winch bumper to the front.

This is my second Wrangler and a third jeep. I had a grand cherokee before the first Wrangler. This last version is like they fixed all of the bad parts by keeping the good stuff. 
-3.6 Pentastar is so much faster than 3.8 engine. I don't feel like I am driving a truck anymore
-suspension is smoother
-steering is more precise
-interior is more refined and way more places to put your things in
The car drives great and I can compare it to the smoothness of a grand cherokee I had before. If you are thinking about changing your wrangler or getting into one, do it - you will love it!
