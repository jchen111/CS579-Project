I just picked up my 2014 Wrangler Unlimited Sport S, 5 speed manual on Saturday. I love it. I went with the UConnect/Sirius option and it works perfect. It doesn't have navigation like I am used to but...its a Jeep and I am ok with that. It's simply a really fun car to drive. I haven't taken the full roof or doors off yet but that is this weekend.
