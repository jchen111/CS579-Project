I have waited to purchase a Jeep Wrangler for several years.
I have not been disappointed!
For you 40 somethings; this is not your dad's Jeep.
It has creature comforts, not a choppy ride, not cold / hot, good acceleration, easy top removal, and most importantly;
FUN!
Don't listen to other reviews about not being a daily driver.
I commute 54 miles daily to work on the highway and back roads without issue or regret.
If you are penny pinching and worried about your fuel bill, you may want to think twice about a Jeep.
It is what it is and the fun factor has certainly more than offset the pump price.
Great fun.

This is our fifth Jeep. We've always have had great luck with these vehicles. I decided to go with the 5 speed auto. My other Wranglers have been manual trans. This is the Wrangler that fits all occasions. Rides very nice, leather interior, Nav, SAT radio, 7 spoke mags. Went with the hard top. They can easily be off in less than 10 minutes. Very quite. The soft tops are really a pain. For the SAT radio, they have the antennae in the dash instead of having those dorsal finned antennae coming off the top.
