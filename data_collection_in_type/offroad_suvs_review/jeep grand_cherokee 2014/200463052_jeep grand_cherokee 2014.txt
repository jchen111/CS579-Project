Have had this GC a little over 1 yr and have had it to service on average once a month including 2 recalls and I'm waiting for the 3rd one. For the last 3 months the car has a creeking ( like walking on a old wood floor ) that starts in the back and moves all around the car,including when you shut the car off it still continues,It was in the shop for what should have been 2 days turned into 10 days and less than 2 miles down the road it started doing the same thing .I have recorded the sounds numerous times abd have them saved .Today as it sat running in my garage I raised the back and i could hear it coming from the rear door I put my hand around touching and felt so much play.Not normal ,

I purchased the Summit after many months of study and test driving 2013 and 14 models.
I needed a step rail for family member safety and ability to use the vehicle.
At the time of delivery I was informed Chrysler did not have a step rail that would fit the Summit.
I could not believe it so I took delivery thinking they were wrong.
A 2nd Chrysler dealer said there must be a problem in the computer because it showed 2014 as accepting the step rail but my VIN not accepting the step rail.
As of today, no one has a step rail and I have a 52,000 car my wife can not get into and drive.
 No after market available either.
I googled the problem and found a Jeep Forum question dated Oct 2013.

Bought 2014 Grand Cherokee Summit on Dec 21, 2013. 18 days later it was flatbed towed out of my home garage. It would not shift into reverse. Due to our dissatisfaction, we were kicked up to corporate with Resolution team. A brand new transmission is being installed now, a full 2 wks after being towed. Being told from service dept that it is taking longer to install than anticipated, as it is a bigger job than they thought. That makes the customer feel confident. Virtually no communication from corporate or dealership. Do not want this "new" majorly repaired car back. Problem with the transmission seems to be happening with many of the new purchases. Expected a reliable new vehicle for the $

I've been driving a long list of German cars over the past 20 years - in fact this is my first American car.
My last vehicle was a BMW X6.
After two weeks with my GC Summit, I have to admit that it's fun to drive, has excellent performance, great fuel economy for a 5K plus pound vehicle, and is quiet.
There are some differences in interior fit and finish quality.
Some of the plastic on the center console looks cheap and is in stark contrast to the generally great quality of the dash/instrument panel and seating.
Overall, however, for a car with a list prices of nearly $25K less than an X6, it's a great value.

We have owned our 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland for 5 months. Tomorrow will be the fifth time it is going in the shop. We have transmission problems that are dangerous, problems with the radio which controls the heat/ac/clock/navi, the speedometer blanked out at one time and the abs breaks maded the car almost come to a complete stop on a highway.
The Jeep dealership continues to do "computer updates" to the car and it continues to have problems. Now we also have a squeak in the back. Beautiful car but terrible reliability! Not safe to drive!!!!!!! Do Not Buy.
