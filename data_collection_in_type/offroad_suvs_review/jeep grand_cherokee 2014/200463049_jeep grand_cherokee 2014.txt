I have had a Jeep Grand Cherokee in the past.
It was like a little tank. Great ride, sense of safety, held the road.
I loved it. Not so much with the 2014 model.
It has been in the shop 6 times since I bought it in November 2013. Once for acceleration problems and 5 for radio/navigation inaccuracies.

I love my 2014 JGC Summit. It drives so smooth and quiet. The bigger touch screen is great and makes it easier to see the maps. The sound system is the best I have ever had in a car and love it. The handling is so sweet, corners well and it has plenty of pick up and go. The gas mileage is so much better than my old Hemi. It looks beautiful on the outside and inside. I feel pampered and spoiled to say the least. A fun and great SUV to own. I say get one and enjoy it.

Picked up my Grand Cherokee Summit with the EcoDiesel last week. Power delivery is exceptional with the 8 speed automatic and diesel engine. Averaging about 25 mpg in mixed driving with winter blend diesel. Fit and finish is flawless. Found a delivery checklist at Jeep Garage dot org and went over the Jeep with a fine tooth comb upon receipt, no issues. More snow headed our way this weekend so we'll see how the 4wd system works. So far, I am loving this vehicle. Truth be told, this is the nicest vehicle that I have ever owned, and I have owned quite a few.

My lease on a 2011 Mercedes E-350 four matic was expiring & I drove ALL the high end suvs, & NOTHING comes close to my Summit!! The Mercedes
M class seats are a pain to put down, expensive for gas & insurance, the Audi don't give a decent lease payment, same for the BMW X-5. A lot of suvs also don't have avail the active headlights, which are awesome!!I have had no problems with anything, gas mileage is about 19 city & 25 highway. A really fab vehicle!!

I'm very happy and impressed with my new Jeep purchased 2013 between christmas and New Years. The vehicle feels solid, smooth, and is fun to drive. My search for the best SUV started early 2013 with a 2013 BMW X5 loaner while my wife's car was in for service. I test drove them all, but with the focus on a two-row, mid-size that provided good handling (for and SUV), decent acceleration and lots of leg room all around. I did not want too much storage with the school bus feel. Exterior styling and luxury interior with a large touch control/nav. screen along with a good sound system also on the wish list. The Summit provided all of these things and much more, like strong off road abilities.

Purchased Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit a month ago.
Already have 2k miles on it and it is indeed a joy to drive.
Handles in snow and high winds beautifully.
The electronics are a bit overwhelming in the first few days - best to plan a few 10 minute parking times to play with adjustments. I found lots of great features in the menus. 

Love it so far.
And the weather has given the SUV a real workout.
But it is an amazingly comfortable, quiet and nice riding vehicle!

I bought a 2014 GC Summit diesel for Christmas
less than a month old and been into the dealer 3 times. This last time tranny is stuck in 3rd gear, 
all I can say is do not buy this vehicle! You have been warned! If you are even considering a Heep run away, run far away....
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Safety hazard; Mirrors and columns obstruct
vision - big time. Dangerous!!!
GPS; Use your phone or buy another car. GPS tends to gives bogus directions. It sends me in/out of the freeway for no reason.
Hum; car hums. Dealer says "Hemi hum", period - end of story. They demonstrated that other GC do the same.
Radio; Volume must be adjusted and re-adjusted each time we change AM to AM and back. If you do so - to avoid commercials - buy another car. Dealership acknowledged the problem, demonstrated that other 2014 GC do the same and replaced the radio - to no avail. Reception is very weak as well.
Too many useless buttons on steering wheel.
Other electronic features are inadequate as well.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have had nothing but problems with my new $50K Jeep GC limited. Transmissions clanks when shifting. Hesitates when trying to speed up. The uconnect went out and had to be replaced. Touch screen went out. Rear hatch will not open when pressing the remote control. Rear hatch inside trim fell off. Door locks takes several attempts to open the door. GPS is very unreliable. Set the radio to a station and turn it back on and it goes to another station. But the worst problem is the blind spots around the vehicle, I have almost gotten into several accidents because of the poor visibility.
Each time I have taken the vehicle into the dealer it is like pulling teeth to get them to honor the warranty
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bought the Summit in August, so I am just under two months in, and it is one heck of an improvement from my 2009 Overland (Hemi), which was very reliable and had very few problems. Ride and handling are improved, and the V-6 has plenty of power for just about anything short of pulling a large trailer. There was a problem with the Blind Spot Monitoring system, and the dealer just replaced its control module (less than an hour). My first trip during the first week yielded ~26 MPG, mostly on the highway. While I never buy a vehicle solely upon gas mileage, this was a nice bonus. Combined driving yields 22-23 MPG. The ZF 8-speed transmission makes this Jeep work well.
