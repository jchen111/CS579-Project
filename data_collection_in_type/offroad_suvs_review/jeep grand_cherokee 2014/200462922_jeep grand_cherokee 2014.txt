Thought my problem were so unusual that I would get support til I read these entries. Transmission:Routinely refuses to change gear. Have to shift
it into Sports mode and then back into regular mode to get it out of 1st gear; b.	has started popping out of gear into neutral while the car is in motion and will not go back into gear. 2.	Cruise Control doesn't work.
3.	Engine light remains on all of the time.

4.FCW cruise control and Select Terrain don't work even after module replaced 5. navsystem wanders off road constantly, 6. USB plug inop 7. phone periodically disconnects w/service alert 8.locked itself with key(and dogs)
inside 

Ready to sell at a $10k loss. piece of junk.

Leased a 2014 JGC Overland.
Had it for a year & just traded it for an Acura.
All in all, not a bad car. Comfortable, nice features (when they worked), sharp looking.
Definitely opt for V8 or V6 (I didn't - mistake).
Jeep has got to focus on overall reliability across the board.
In particular is the technology.
So unreliable.
Would turn on car & no volume, navigation has no idea where I am.
Half the time couldn't change stations or adjust volume. UConnect is a waste. You get Yelp & Pandora for a fee (free on my teenagers Honda Accord). Navi input crazy slow.
The wifi option is expensive & completely worthless. Transmission stinks. Step on accelerator & stand still for a few seconds.

I hav 2014 Jeep Overland V8, fully loaded and its a beautiful gas guzzler that drives pretty darn well.....when it works. It is 13 months old and has about 9500 miles, here is the problem list:

The forward collision warning system goes off randomnly, activating the brakes about half the time!!!! This is the worst problem I have, its unsafe, the vehicle will brake very hard when this happens, I have almost been rear ended several times. It has been in the shop 6 times for this problem. FYI they replaced the camera/sensor, the part cost $1400 according to the warranty ticket!!!
5 other signifcant problems and Jeep cust service is horrid, its getting lemon lawed!!

My wife and I both own a Jeep GC Overland.
She has the 2013 V-8 Overland and as a result of our enjoyment of her car, I leased a 2014 V-6.
Overall, excellent.
Gas mileage on the V-6 is excellent for the vehicles' size.
Interior is well laid out and very comfortable as we are both over 5'11" tall.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I recently purchased the GC Overland in late January. I traded a smaller Honda Accord sedan for this SUV and I am loving every second of it. My Jeep is the beautiful gold/cashmere and I received it with complimentary tinting from the dealer since I was waiting for several days for it to arrive. I live in MS and it handles the rough and lower quality roads we have SO much better than my Accord did because of the bigger wheels and better suspension setup. The 20" wheels that come with the Overland really bring the car together and make it look so much more expensive than it actually was for me. The engine and transmission really make the car feel so much more responsive and sporty than an SUV.

I got the Overland with light interior and the V6.

Cons:
-The felt stuff they used for the "misc" holder on the top of the console cannot be cleaned.
I have no idea what they were thinking.
It's just pure stupidity.
-The silver plastic on the center console looks and feels really cheap to me.
It also scratches easily.
-I don't like the dry/broken-earth background on the stereo.

Neutral:
-The carpet isn't that great.
-The plastic isn't that great.
-The grill on the Overland, where it's just the outline of the "teeth" in chrome doesn't look very good.

Pros:
-I didn't like the flat/matte dark wood at first.
I like it now.
I think that was forward design.
-V6 is peppy
