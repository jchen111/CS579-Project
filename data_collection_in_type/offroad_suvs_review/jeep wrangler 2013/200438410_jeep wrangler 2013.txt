Bought a new 2013 Wrangler.
Was very excited.
Loved Jeeps, not anymore.
Electronic Stability Control went out on me 3 times("and fixed") on the freeway.
Went into Limp mode(kills the engine) and was almost run over by a Big Rig.
Chrysler willing to do nothing.
Had to get a lawyer and lemon law it. Worst company and service EVER.
Jeep are iconic and I know thay are appealing BUT they are not run by the same people anymore AND the service is on par with cable companies.
Be very careful. ruined my summer and almost killed my family.

I've always wanted a jeep. I lived in Southern California for 30 years and always had a motorcycle and
convertible SL 500. I wished I would of bought the jeep back then and I would of killed to birds with one stone.
I love how easy it is to take the top and doors off the way it drives on the freeway.....just a bit loud from the wind....but it's a Jeep.
I probably found the make and model of the car I will drive for the rest of my life.
