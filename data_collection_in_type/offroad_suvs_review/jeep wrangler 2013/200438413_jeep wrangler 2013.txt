I've had our Wrangler approximately a year and a half. For the record - I'm a Jeep NUT. I still have the first Jeep I ever bought new: A 86 CJ-7 Laredo.
The wife and I have always had jeeps in our 25 years of marriage. Mainly Cherokees and Grand Cherokees. Reliability was always decent, except for the disc brakes, which always suffered from warped rotors.
The new Wrangler was our first venture into "regular" jeeps since my '86 purchase.
In a nutshell - I LOVE it. Power and handling are spot-on. It's comfortable, hard top removal and install is a cinch, and it's a blast to drive. Long term reliability remains to be seen of course (especially with the Pentestar) but for now I am sold.

It's been 6 months and about 6,000 miles and I could not be happier.
During the summer with the top off it was great and very fun to drive.
I've not had any problems (mechanical or otherwise) and have only paid for a couple oil changes.
The little touches are nice especially in the interior: little Jeep logos, lights for the cup holders, etc.
Gas mileage has been right on the mark at 17.3mpg for mostly city driving.
I do wish that it came with a coin holder, but aside from this it's been a fantastic vehicle.
Can't wait for the Michigan snow to fly!

First off it is a Jeep so the priority of being able to head off the beaten path, plow through snow, and over things have to be something at the top of your list o/w get yourself a Honda Pilot or Minivan!
I have 3 x Kids (9, 7, 3) under the age of 10 and the most awesome facet of the Unlimited is the ability to host 3x Kids seats!
They love it!
I went on a ski trip and was able to pack for a family of five w/out putting on a cargo carrier or nothing!
The Sahara Model - provides a nice balance of jeep ruggedness with creature comforts.

I just got my first Jeep Wrangler Moab Edition, manual, premium soft top with saddle brown leather interior. I live in CT. There are no official off road trails here but Wranglers are still very popular. I love the ride more than I thought I would and its pluses outweigh any minuses. Before buying it, I read reviews where people complained about various things. To those people I'd say...drive an updated one. They've changed a lot in the last 3 years. Road noise is no more than my previous car especially with the radio on. I don't have the hard top but the premium soft top keeps out the cold as the heaters crank even at 10 degrees outside. I love having the only Moab edition in my area.

I have had probably 5 Jeeps in my life... This one is one of the best! I have almost 10,000 miles on it now and haven't had any problems at all.
The build quality is equal to if not better then my previous car (Acura TSX).
 The new engine is perfect, I use the Jeep to tow my 20ft boat to and from the lake with no lack of power.
