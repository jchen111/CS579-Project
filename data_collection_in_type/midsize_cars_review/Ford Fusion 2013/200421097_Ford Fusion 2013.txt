We were Accord drivers for a long time but I wanted to buy American for our new car.
We liked the Fusion's styling, quiet ride, and features. After driving for 3 months we absolutely love it.
Not only is it quick, but the ride is so quiet it enhances the fun of driving.
The car handles great and I actually like the My Ford touch system - I can easily navigate from one screen to the next no problem.
Regarding fuel economy, we drive up and down a mountain everyday so I've lost track.
We bought it because it has a sleek new look and really affordable.
From now on, I'm a happy Fusion driver.

Lots of people have been complaining about MPG on their new Fusion. I am getting around 24 average MPG, and live in Minnesota where it has been below zero every night since I bought the car! I went from a F150 with ecoboost to the Fusion because of the bold design, AWD, and did not have the use for the truck anymore. 

People need to give their new car a little more time before it starts producing the rated MPG. It doesn't happen in the first tank of gas.

Ive had this car about 3 weeks now, and im pretty happy overall. The suspension system allows for nice handling, and it seems more agile than the car size implies. The power is decent, but seems like it could use another 20 horses or so. I expected some turbo lag, but its really not as bad as some of the other turbos ive driven.
The car looks and feels as if it should be in the luxury class and seems much better than the Altima 3.5, Camry, and Jetta that i drove.
In the few 3 hour road trips ive taken (90% thruway and highway), i averaged about 24 mpg - much lower than expected. I used regular gas and drove 74 and 64 mph.
This car is too fun to drive making it tough to milk for mpg.
