Best day of my life...
By far the worst car I've ever owned.
Keep your sanity and avoid this car at all cost!
I am dead serious.
I gave the ratings what slack I could since I've reviewed before and can't delete previous ones.
If powers that be can delete the others, feel free...

I have a 2013, 3.5S.
I got it because it was on end of year special and I expect excellent things from Nissan.
Normally, I go for smaller and sportier. This one is very sporty, lots of get up and go.
The sound of the engine is actually throaty, with a growl, surprising. Not loud, but it sounds good.
It handles pretty well but the stock tires are just ok in winter conditions, found out just today. The seats are comfy and with this version the stereo/high tech is minimal but still what I need. The configurable display is actually pretty techy but I guess I'm saying the S version stereo is minimal. Dunno if it is ok to say, but for 21K this was a steal of a deal.
Had to buy at Xmas though.

The 2013 will probably go down in history books of how NOT to build and market a car.
The transmission still isn't working right (2 dealer trips as of today, and still won't admit to hearing a clattering noise coming from transmission billed as being unusually smooth), but lets make some impressive titanium paddle shifters that don't turn with the wheel (stupid).
That will take their minds off all of the clattering and squeeling under the hood.
I honestly hope someone steals this car for (crappy) parts.
It's pretty on the inside and outside, but it has the character of worn out old truck.
Pathetic.
Really

I really wanted to love this car, but the quality is sub par to put it mildly.
We replaced a 2012 Nissan Juke that we loved (rear-ended and totaled).
I kick myself every day for not buying another one.
The transmission is noisy, the power steering pump is noisy, and the interior rattles more than an American car with 200k miles on it.
Nissan says that the transmission is supposed to sound like the old "baseball card in the bicycle spokes", but I'm not buying it.
The Juke transmission was perfect, but this one is perfectly horrible.
I get mad every time I have to drive it.
I'm done with Nissan.
My next car was going to be a 370Z, but I'd buy a Korean car first...

Among the many continuing problems -heated seats that don't heat unformally;power sterring wine, no fix after 6 months; very hard ride -they suggested I change tires! GPS is ridiculous, Center vents can never be closed- continually run air unless you turn off system. Sensor for cabin temp is on the top of the dashboard - when ever it's sunny, even in winter it blows cold a/c air to cool no matter if the cabin is 40 degrees. rearview camera washes out in sunlight. Blind spot system is usless in wet weather - it either sees nothing or falses all of time. Nothing can be adjusted! Interior drivers area is tight - & I'm only 5-7". No passenger power seat in a 32K car! The CVT trans slips.
