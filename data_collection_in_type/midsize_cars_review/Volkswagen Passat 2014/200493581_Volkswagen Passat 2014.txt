My '14 Passat is a real nice car that actually is quite simple to operate.  Interior design is classic and the exterior may seam a bit boring at first, but at different angles the cars exterior lines show the true elegance of the car.  I paid 18,700 for the 21,900 sticker car and got 0% financing to boot.  So for the price of a focus or corolla I was able to get a sweet Passat that is extremely roomy and just as efficient as those two cars.
