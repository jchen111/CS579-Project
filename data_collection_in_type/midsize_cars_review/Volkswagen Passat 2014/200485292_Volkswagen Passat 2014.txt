1) Mileage: You will get blown away - the EPA numbers are junk (as usual) but in the opposite direction of gas cars. Here you get more, a lot MORE than claimed. 

Note: Hybrids will always outperform in stop and go city traffic. However, on the highway, diesels will blow hybrids away. The choice is thus dependent on driving environment. 

2) The engine is silk smooth, once above 1.3k rpm. 

3) The car is big, especially the back seat and the trunk. 

4) Suspension is on the softer side and absorbs bumps very nicely.

5) Very low road noise

6) Have had a couple of squeeks and rattles from the dashboard in the first month. A little worried about build quality.
