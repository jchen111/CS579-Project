Leased a 2011 turbo and thought the car was great.
I only had a few small nits to pick and it was like the engineers were listening to me since the 2014 model addressed virtually all my issues.
Steering wheel lights up brighter, ride is more controlled, sound deadening improved. Economy and performance still top notch. Seats more comfy, and back-up camera very slick.
It makes if virtually impossible to seriously find
another car with the value for the money.
Tried Audi, Fusion.
A4 Audi was slick, but if equipped like the Optima, it was over $41K...not a good deal.

I highly recommend the Optima.
