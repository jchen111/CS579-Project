I nursed my 2000 Protege to the bitter end but spent the last year researching new cars. While I test drove other cars (the 2013 Accord was the best, nice and smooth but bland), I kept coming back to the 2014 6. 

I drive stick and tested the Touring and Sport trims. In the end the options on the Touring weren't worth the extra $$$. The touchscreen was distracting, the 19" wheels looked good but didn't ride well on rough rural roads, etc. Of course I've never had most modern options, so I don't look to my car for infotainment stuff. The 6 Sport is a dream to drive, and that's good enough for me. And after incentives the price was barely over $20k, which is crazy low for this much car.

I have driven 3000 miles.
Best highway mpg was 41!
In slow big city traffic 27.
This is a tight responsive, beautiful car.
Good solid power, great handling, wonderful seats and a joy to drive.
The manual is precise and engaging. The stereo is a little weak. The Sport is a real bargain. Way better mpg and improved handling over manual 2010 Accord coupe it replaced.
I am very happy with this car and I like that I don't see them on every block. I got asked if it was a Tesla!

Anyone considering a mazda 6 should wait until they resolve the following serious issue:

My 2014 sport has been in and out of service for loud clunking noises in the rear brakes. So far neither the dealer nor the mazda techs who came out have been able to resolve it.

Apparently it has something to do with the calipers. So far they've replaced many of the parts in both rear brakes to no effect. Currently I am waiting while they manufacture larger brake pads to install to see if this solves the issue.

I asked them to just replace my vehicle, as this has been dragging on for a long time, but they refuse, so I'm stuck with it while they use me as a guinea pig for their tests.
