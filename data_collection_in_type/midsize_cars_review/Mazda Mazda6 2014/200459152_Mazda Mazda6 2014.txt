I'll cut right to the chase. This is arguably the best-looking car on the road right now, at least with the red paint job. The car feels extremely planted on the highway, and the g-force generated by turning is strangely addictive. Power steering is light for day-to-day driving, but tightens up a bit when you push it. You feel every bump on the road, but I like that, as it makes you feel connected to the road, and there is certainly no chassis wiggle after hitting bumps. Definitely wind noise above 45mph or so, and I have noticed the back window creaking for the first 10-15 minutes of driving on a very cold day. Headlights could be stronger, but are adequate, and base sound system is great.

Finally, an honest review of the good and the bad. Not sure why people leave such biased reviews - all cars have faults. I'd buy the same car again, but let's look at a few things to keep in mind when you test drive.
First the good. A beautiful car from any angle - the best in the segment.Terrific gas mileage. Great handling. Comfortable, with a very nice interior if you're not into lots of clutter. Fun to drive. Roomy. Good price. Now some hard truths. Mediocre acceleration from stop. Poor rear visibility. Poor infotainment system, badly positioned, with a laggy voice response system. Massive wind noise. USB difficult to get to Tiny cheap useless sun visors.

I have 1500 miles so far, having some issue with the steering wheel column making vibrating noises whenever the car's driving on bumpy roads, sounded like somethings loosen. I went back to the dealer to report the problem and they said it is a common problem that they've seen before and Mazda have a solution for it. That was three weeks ago, and now this vibrating noise is back again. Also, one of the air conditioning vent makes a noticeable whistle sound if air speed is over 50%. Any of you had similar problems?

For the same price as a boring old camry, you can have the Mazda6, an extremely good looking, road-hugging, fuel sipping beast of a car. It looks like an infiniti with more character, it drives like a low and light bimmer, and costs half of either. While not perfect on the inside (the seats leave me a little sore; maybe it's just cause I'm 6'4") it's definitely a no brainer to get.

Researched and drove most midsize cars. Nissan Altima is cheapest with the most stuff but extremely bland and a terrible CVT trans.
Really liked Passat and Accord but then decided to give the M6 a try.
I was instantly impressed with the driving dynamics and the nice interrior.
I had a 2008 M6 a couple years back and this one blows it out of the water.
I like that I was able to get the Nav package as an add-on.
I wanted to keep the price low but I like Nav... and this one DOES have traffic updates.
.
I have 1000 miles on it and all three tanks have gotten me 33mpg mostly highway commuting.
May not be the best deal in terms of incentives, but got $1500 off price plus mil discount.

I have had my 6 for a month now, and have put about 1,800 miles on it. So far I am loving it. The ride is firm but smooth, steering is tight and accurate and the Bluetooth features are awesome. I almost bought a Kia Optima, but once I saw the Mazda 6, I was hooked. 

I have been more than pleased with my mileage. I have been tracking it with an app on my phone and I have been getting around 33 mpg +/-, with a 60/40 highway/city split. This is about the same as my old 2002 Honda Civic! I have been keeping my speed in check and haven't hot-rodded it too much, but I don't drive it easy either.

We looked at Accord,Altima,Fusion,Optima,Malibu,and others.Then I heard about the new Skyactiv Mazda 6 from a friend.Test drove our Soul Red sport and bought it on the spot.My friends think I spent big bucks as the car looks very expensive.For a base model the list of standard features is impressive.Leanst the steering stops.t agaither steering wheel,shift knob and e-brake handle are nice touches.I also liked the 1000 dollar owner loyalty rebate. This car as all 2014 Mazda 6's is built in Japan.Not too many cars are made there anymore due to the higher cost of production and shipping.The build quality is excellent.

Just bought the 2014 Mazda 6 sport last week. It's a great car. It's design and handling really make it stand out among midsize family sedans. It won't win any drag races but it has competitive acceleration for it's class and gets great gas mileage. I am averaging 29mpg with about 50% highway (60-65mph) and 50% city driving. Some things I have noticed: Plenty of backseat space, gigantic trunk, smooth transmission, suspension stiffer than others but results in better handling, road noise is acceptable but not the quietest and the base model radio stinks but that's to be expected (will upgrade soon) I highly recommend. At least test drive it.

I was really impressed with the driving dynamics and fuel economy of my 2012 mazda3 skyactiv. I was planning to get the cx5, but when i test drove the 6, I left the dealership with it. This time I am getting the 2.5 skyactiv, more power and torque. The car looks fantastic in pictures but when I saw my actual car, white pearl, wow wow wow. So much better even. It's a combination of sleek, sexy and macho upfront. I am getting so much for the price. Interior is high end, classy not over. This is a head turner. Friend said it has the presence of the big BMW 5 series.

This is the best car buying decision I think I made. Stunning looks, solid build quality, good visibility, excellent handling and road feel, best steering feel I ever experienced. Have put on about 800 miles, getting 30 mpg (70% city).
The ride and road feel is getting better every day as it is breaking in.
Power and acceleration is quite good for 4 cyl, better than the Altima/Camry/Outback/Malibu I test drove.
Hill start assist is a useful feature. I did not notice any significant road noise as some have mentioned.
Gear shift is well tuned for optimum acceleration and fuel efficiency.
Touch screen size is good enough, intutive and works well, no problem pairing BT phone.
