When you've got to stir your own gears, your choices are limited these days.
It seems like you can do it if you opt for a stripped down small car, or a tricked-out european performance sedan.
In the mid-level market there is pretty much Mazda and Subaru.
Good luck actually finding a stick in America for any other brand.

Since I have kids in car seats, rear seat room was an issue.
Car seats are ridiculously huge these days.
So I had to go a little bit bigger but I didn't want a large SUV.
They just aren't fun to drive.
I loved my old Subaru Forester, but unfortunately Subaru killed the driving feel in their effort to mass-market and Camry-ize the new Forester and Outback.

First a foremost I'm conformable in this car and I'm 6'4",I have plenty of leg/head room.
The engine and transmission are great together and the car just begs to be driven fast.
The firm suspension is tight/firm but it brings fun to driving again around corners; on flat surfaces its rather smooth.
40mpg is an easy mark to hit on Hway.
I have had no issues with the media system and my usb just plays songs like it should, it connects well with my phone too!
This car really is fun to drive and with the manual is great!

I test drove the Optima, Accord, Fusion and this car bet them all in comfort, features, handling, and style!
Get it and you'll love it.

My first Mazda and im not disappointed. The car feels very light and its very nimble compared to other models I test drove. I decided on the manual since I like to feel more involved when driving, the trans is smooth and has short throws compared to others. The design is sporty and refreshing compared to other mainstream sedans. 250 miles in and avg 30mpg but have been driving pretty aggressively, we'll have to see when the excitement subsides and see how much more I can get out of skyactive. Love driving this sporty sedan and the stares I get everywhere I go is a sign that Mazda has a winner here.
