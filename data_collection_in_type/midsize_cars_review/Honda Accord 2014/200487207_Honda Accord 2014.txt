I have had my new Accord EX-L 4cyl for two weeks now and have been very happy with it.
The car is roomy, well appointed and the fit and finish is excellent.
The CVT that mimics a regular shifting transmission is excellent and the 4cyl has plenty of performance.
On my first road trip, I averaged 41.7mpg going and 39.8mpg returning.
Admittedly, that was driving @60mph, which for me is fast enough.
At 70 years of age, I'm in no hurry to get somewhere...just getting there is enough.
My only negative is the ride.
While not bad, it is definitely on the sporty side.
The amazing thing is that my insurance only went up .40 cents over my older car with the exact same coverage. Very happy here.

Gas mileage is fantastic BUT there is way too much vibration in the steering wheel at some speeds that's really annoying. It happens around 30-35 mph and again around 65-70 mph. Makes it very annoying to drive long distances. Ride quality is very stiff causing you to feel every bump and ripple in the road. The dealer updated the engine computer and rebalanced the wheels but the vibrations are still there. I'm now working with the factory rep to find out what's causing the vibrations. This is my first Honda and maybe my last if they don't fix the vibration problems.

We have had our new Accord for about a month and a half and put on about 4K miles, including a 3K mile trip.
The new accord is a very smooth car, especially around town, and gets excellent gas mileage.
We have always bought the V6 model, and traded a 2007 EXL-V6 for the new one.
I was reluctant to buy a 4 cyl. but a test drive impressed me.
Indeed, it does have plenty of acceleration and so far the CVT is very nice.
Some have said that the CVT roars when you accelerate, but we find it to be similar to the V6 roar when it downshifts.
It doesn't accelerate quite as fast as the 07 V6, but it was more than adequate when merging on the interstates.
Our gas mileage was 37 mpg for the trip.

I have had numerous Honda's.
Last Accord being a 2003.
Had went to a 2012 Fit Sport after that Accord, wanting something different, good car, but missed the Accord.
Lots of smiles per miles in my new Accord.
Hard to find any faults.
EX-L.
Was a little leary of a CVT transmission, having heard Car and Driver say they did not like them for years, but they said they liked this one, so I gave it a try.
Pleasantly surprised with how much I like the CVT.
The Fit had a 5-speed manual.
I have had the 2014 Accord for a couple months and would buy again without hesitation.

I love the re-design of the new accord and it's sleek look. Gives very good mileage too. Nice and smooth driving experience so far.
