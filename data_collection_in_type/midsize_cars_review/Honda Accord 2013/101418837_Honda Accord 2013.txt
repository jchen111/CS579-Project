I purchased the Accord Sport with a 6 speed manual just over a year ago after shopping around for something sporty, reliable, and affordable. I love the car! I have had no problems with the car to date. The car is averaging 30mpg with mixed driving, the best mileage I have achieved was 37mpg on a 350 mile trip which included stop and go highway traffic. I consider this is a great 'bipolar car"- I can take it down some twisty back roads and have some fun, or I can cart the grandparents on a 7 hour trip in comfort. The connectivity is excellent in terms of Bluetooth and the iPod interface. I would highly recommend this car to my friends and family.

After 8 months of ownership, the title sums it all up. I cannot think of another sedan in this segment, and at this price, that can eclipse the performance of the Accord Sport with the 6-speed manual. Good acceleration, surprisingly high cornering limits and arguably the best shifter this side of BMW. The trade off is a set of truly awful Goodyear Eagle LS 2 tires (loud, no grip in wet, overly stiff), a spartan but functional interior with terrible seat fabric and the cheapest door plastic in the industry. Also did I mention the squeaks and rattles after only 5k miles.

After 3 months and 5,800 miles I am over all happy with my Accord Sport. The excellent manual transmission really gives this car some character, and it succeeds in its mission as a fun, affordable commuter car as well as a family hauler. I took a very close look at the new Mazda 6 Touring MT (an excellent car) but the Accord won out on virtue of superior head room (for my tall family), outward visibility, better shifter and the smoother, higher revving engine. I would have preferred to have had a bit more sport added from the factory (front seats, suspension, steering wheel feedback and small interior details) which would have transformed it into a front wheel drive quasi-sport sedan.

This is my 6th Honda Accord (79/80/84/91/05/13), and I've liked every one.
BUT this one is in a completely different category.
Best car I've ever had - and in many ways.
The Sport model was made for "ME" - large inside, handles great, 6 speed manual transmission is great, and very zippy and fun to drive.
The 18" wheels really make a difference, as does whatever they did to stiffen the front suspension of the car.
Hit 100 MPH driving uphill at 11,000 feet above sea level (5th gear).

Have 3,500 miles now, so feel I can give a good posting on the car.
This is my 5th Honda--and it's definitely the best to date.
Traded my V6 auto Accord to this 4 cyl. manual Sport model--really fun car to drive!
Quick easy throws on the manual and the engine loves to rev in the high range.
The car seems screwed together well--no rattles or initial problems with build quality.
Easy to drive both city and highway--but ride is much firmer than my previous Accord.
Having test driven the Mazda 6 (as this was the closest contender), I went with the Honda for features and value.....but it was a close call.
Gotta say, not disappointed with my purchase at all--really have enjoyed the car.

Accord Sport w/ the 6sp is amazing! I have been a die hard Honda fan, but always liked the Civic model.
Traded in the '08 Civic 5sp manual for this, and have been blown away by the difference in the first 650 miles.
The manual transmission is smooth, the engine is quick to respond, and it's got lots of power I often peel out in between gears when having fun with it.
The quality of the cabin/exterior just feels like it's going to last forever, and I'm looking to push this car over 300,000 miles in the years to come!

Bought this car four months ago and have 1300 miles on it.
The car is very comfortable and fun to drive.
Unfortunately, the car has been back to the dealer 5 times .
The seals around the drivers side window are bad.
The car sounds like a wind tunnel above 60 mph.
In addition, some part is bouncing around in the dash making a constant rattle.
The local dealership and Honda North American did nothing to fix the problem until I made it clear I was filing a lemon law complaint.
Build quality of this first year model has been below normal for Honda's usual high standards.

I'll give the skinny to anyone seriously interested in buying the Accord Sport (MT).
Buy it.
I drove an Altima and the '14 Mazda 6 and neither one compared.
I did not get a chance to drive the CVT version of the Honda Sport (never considered getting a CVT auto), so I cannot honestly review that car.
But the 6 speed manual rocks.
Short throws, very light clutch, responsive throttle.
A pure joy to drive.

If you're looking for an affordable, fun car, you simply can't go wrong with the Accord Sport.
I'm partial to driving manuals, and am amazed at what a great deal it is.
I got mine for $21,800, with a nice dealer installed package thrown in.

I bought a 2013 Accord with the 6 speed manual and it's fantastic. It drives with precision, yet isn't twitchy. the manual is just one of the best I've ever used - snick, snick like butter into each gear. I also love the car isn't bogged down with too much technology. It seems like every mfg. is trying to outdo each other with tech goodies, when what most people want is a basic, good, easy, yet fun to drive car. I fear this Accord may be the last of those honest, easy to drive, basic cars. If you like to shift yourself, and like a bit of sport with you r dive and don't want a ton of tech goodies - it doesn't get much better than a 2013 Accord Sport with a manual.

I just got my honda accord sport in blue today. I waited for a month and a half to get the manual and it was worth the wait. I drove the CVT first and i was ready to take a nap.It sucks! Felt soooo slow! The 6 speed gearbox was tricky from first two second gear but i got used to it. Short throws and fun. Not a afterthought. And feels way quicker than the garbage CVT and better sound too from the dual exhaust. Very rich black interior. I gave 3 out of 5 for reliability because of first day purchase.
