It has great power, gets decent gas millage, it is pretty comfortable to drive. A few minor changes are called for and one MAJOR one. The cup holders are right behind the stick shift, so as you shift, you are constantly hitting the cups/straws/tall water bottles. The windshield wipers on mine streak alot. At about 1000 miles I changed the rubber on my dime (OEM Honda). Made no difference.


The major issue is that the hands free bluetooth software seems to have been designed by an engineering school drop out. The text reading is almost incomprehensible. No point in it since it does not make driving safer if you can't understand it. Phone book features are terrible.

With 4,000 miles on my Accord, here's an update to my original post.
Continue to be impressed with the power and fuel economy this 4 cylinder puts out; although, at times I do miss my prior 6 cyclinder car that had an additional 75 hp.
The manual transmission is a joy to operate with short throws and well defined gates.
Noticed a few quality issues such as the front defroster vent at the base of the windshield pulling up.
Cost cutting is evident on the OE carpeted floor mats.
They have a REALLY cheap feel to them.

Have just over 400 miles on my new Accord.
The manual transmission is a joy to operate and is well matched to the engine.
I am coming from an 04 G35, so I miss some of the extra HP, but the Accord is fairly peppy and the MPG improvement is outstanding.
Not easy finding a manual transmission as dealer stated Honda doesn't allow you to 'order' your vehicle.
Seats are very comfortable and the dash layout is very nice.
There are quality materials throughout and it doesn't feel like Honda was trying to cut cost on the interior.
