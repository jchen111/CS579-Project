Research said the Honda was the minivan to get so I did. I considered the Toyota but with recent recalls across their line I never even test drove one.
Simply got a good price (29500 EX) and that was it.
There was a unsettling clop sound like a horse shoe in a parade from the suspension that proved to be from 40psi tires. I reduced to spec 33 and no more clop. Sound is now as one would expect from a car over bumps.
We regularly get 30 mpg plus or minus 1/2 in extended cruise mode and 23 mixed with about 18 city.
The only real complaint I have at this point is it took several window frosting to discover the defrost button.
It carries 8 people, looks nice, tows and gets 30mpg. Enough said

Our first was a 2011 model which had no issues other than a fussy 5 Spd automatic that vibrated when upshifting. Our 2014 6 speed doesn't have the transmission vibration but it "tugs" a bit on downshift when cold.

Van drives and handles well. The controls you touch most have been improved. Interior noise is about the same as the Sienna. 

While it may cost a bit more than some of its competitors, it retains its value on resale. 

We leased our 2011 with a
buyout of $19,300 (CAD) after 36 months. We bought it out and sold it for $26,500, taking the $7,200 in equity plus $1,500 in cash from Honda and bought a new 2014. We were only out of pocket $9,000 for a brand new van!

Why is reliability stars required? How would I know as it is new with less than 200 miles.

There are only a few choices to seat 8 people -sub as light tow truck/haul cargo.
The Honda Odyssey rose to the top no matter how I sliced it and diced it.
The Toyota seemed very dated on the interior. If I am going to spend 30ish grand then I would expect a little more pizzazz in the interior.
Otherwise the Toyota was a solid contender.


We would seldom need to seat 8 but for the times when parking is a problem we can all meet and pile in and make the last drive/arrive together at the event.
Therefore I spent the extra to upgrade from the LX 7 pass. to the EX 8 pass.

This is the 2nd Odyssey I own. My last one was a 2002. I can't understand why they would put a camera on the right mirror for safety, but not the left. Very spacious - very comfortable.
