Compared to my touring 2009 the new van falls so short.
The inside quality has been reduced to that of an Amerian made van.
The ride is not as smooth.
Options are now overpriced.


My 2009 had an buyer within the hour at above book price.
Interesting that even others see he value in the older models.

You do better o by a used Honda with the old body style.
The old style is a blast to drive.
