Where to start? Well, for all the hype given to SUV's in recent years, I think the critics should emphasize the truth about today's mini-vans.
They have all the bells and whistles now. They might not be as stylish or "cool looking" on the exterior as many SUV's, but if you're older than 16, you can probably live with it. The critics should emphasize the truth about the T&C and Caravan; there is no other family vehicle with more versatility. The stow 'n' go feature is second to none! How nice is it to be able to go from a 7-passenger van to a large cargo van in just minutes? Guess! Ever heard of a van that's actually fun to drive and has a great ride? They make them now!

I am amazed at all the features Chrysler put on this mini van for the price. Fit and finish is excellent. Much better than it was on my old 2005 Dodge GC. Materials are better and gone are the hard look plastic. They seemed to have added almost every safety feature you can think of. Ride is a little firmer than on my old Dodge, but still smooth, with less leaning on curves and handling is more precise. The engine is stronger although not quieter. Mileage about the same as in my old Dodge, even though it has a six speed tranny. Second row S&G seats are a little more padded. The inside of the T/C is just beautiful. Chrysler did a great job on this mini van.

We moved to the 2013 Town and Country last month after three consecutive Toyota Siennas (04, 09, and the new design 11 in AWD).
Where the Sienna's went down in quality from our observations, the T&C is really good so far - not all the incessant rattles that plagued the last Toyota.
The ride is much more comfortable and not floaty like some soft rides can be - they really got it right.
The interior is fantastic - really nicely done and really well equipped - a lesser Toyota or Honda costs much more.
This is also a great MV to drive - great visibility, refined ride and well controlled noise, great car-like (for a MV) driving position.
The three kids love it.
I love it.
My wife loves it.

I bought a 2011 Town and Country Touring new (the base model among the three models)in August 2011.Currently it has 40,000 kms (25,000 miles)mileage.So far so good.Everything works well despite the unpredictable climate here in Ontario,Canada.The only time i bring it to the dealer is for the scheduled oil change at 8000 kms(5000 miles).I bought it for CAD$ 30000 but loaded with lots of luxurious features.To name a few :power left and right sliding doors,power rear door (liftgate),power windows including the quarter windows,satellite radio,remote engine starter,push button engine starter,intelligent key(i don't need to bring out my key or fob from my wallet to open or close the doors,the doors will just unlock automatically
as you touch the door handle and a push button near the door handle to lock
the doors but of course it is also equipped with a keyless feature when you are meters ways from the van,a rear camera,tow n go feature ,dual air control,a 110v outlet.One more thing i like this van is the 283 hp powerful V6 engine,more power than the Odessey,Sienna and other minivans in the market.

I am not sure why the Town and Country is not considered a top class minivan.
The base model, Touring, provides everything a minivan driver craves from the top class but has to pay an arm and a leg for!
The Touring model came standard with DVD, Back-up camera and Power Lift gate!
My Honda Odyssey EX-L did not come with these options as standard options.
The dash is equipped with a lot of gadgets including Bluetooth.
The kids have plug ins in the back for their ipods.
The drive is WAY better than my Odyssey.
It is very quiet.
The engine does sound a little loud when leaving a red light but it levels out quickly.
There were so many incentives that this van was cheaper than a used one!
