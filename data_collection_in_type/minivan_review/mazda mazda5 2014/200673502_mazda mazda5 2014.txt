We have a Mazda5 Sport with only 22,000 miles.  The paint around both front wheel wells has flaked off to bare metal.  And, the paint along the rocker panels on both sides and up the doors 12-18 inches has also flaked off, ruining the finish.  Mazda refuses to cover the repair of this and says that something on the roads "back east" used for snow removal caused the paint to fail.  Unbelievable but they won't cover a fix.  I have filed an arbitration claim with the Better Business Bureau.  Beware of Mazda cars "back east" -- they have a paint adhesion problem!  see site:  my mazda sucks dot com

when our 2007 mazda3 was totaled we knew we wanted another mazda.
we had that car since new with 130k on it and no issues.
We also wanted something for our growing family but yet something kind of fun to drive.
My wife refuses to drive anything but a manual transmission.
So the mazda5 has fit the bill for everything.
we don't usually have more than 4 people in the car at a time but it's nice to know we can fit 6 if needed.
If you plan on taking this for long vacations using all six seats..BUY the roof rack!
MPG so far has averaged 28/ best 32..mostly hwy and long stretches of 40mph roads during my commute.
For a young couple that like smaller maneuverable cars this is the way to go!
