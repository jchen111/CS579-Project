As 2 over 70 people we like the upright seats of a mini-van.
Visibility is great in all directions.
Power was very adequate on a recent trip in the mountains.
It was helpful to downshift with the lever because it would try to shift up too soon otherwise. Mileage was very good even when doing lots of driving in 4th.
Mileage is much better (27+ at high speeds (70+) than around town (23)
Stow and go seating is the only way to go.
We haul a lot of stuff and need to put the seats down often.
Very easy to do.

Purchased the van because of its flexibility and usefulness. Disappointment came soon after I purchased it. The Caravan was my second consecutive new Dodge purchase. It will be my last. The six-speed transmission almost caused a very serious accident on two occasions. After pulling out from a dead stop, the transmission suddenly upshifted from first to fourth or fifth gear immediately. It began to shudder and took several seconds to downshift to a more appropriate gear. I normally would have had plenty of room. I contacted two dealerships and was informed that there were no issues with the transmission. This was AFTER the first corrective update. This vehicle can be dangerous.
