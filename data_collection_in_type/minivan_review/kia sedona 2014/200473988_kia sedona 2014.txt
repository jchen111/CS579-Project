We have only had the Sedona for 2 weeks, but we really like it. It feels great, has plenty of power, and cost a lot less that the Toyota or the Honda vans.
The pedals adjust for my wife, who is 5 feet tall, and she loves it.
It has leather, power seat with memory, and everything I want. It has a sun roof, which I didn't want.
If it missing anything, I can't imagine what it might be.
It has back up camera, back up warning, blue tooth.
