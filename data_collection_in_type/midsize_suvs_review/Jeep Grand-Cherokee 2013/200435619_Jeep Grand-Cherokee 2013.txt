Our 2013 Grand Cherokee Overland had the fish bite experience in the transmission described all over the web. We brought it back to the dealership with only 200 miles on it. That began a series of visits over the course of a year Â– 8 visits in all.


We finally received a software update (first promised in March 2013, then June, then July, and then August). The software update made the problem worse!

After pursuing the Lemon Law process and getting nowhere with Chrysler, we gave in and traded it for a totally different make/model - with zero regrets.
The GC was a gigantic waste of time and money.

I've only driven it for a little less than 2000 miles, but so far it's been great..Quiet and a smooth ride.
The sound system is great..lots of options here too (e.g., satellite radio, cd, ipod, etc.).
Great looking exterior and interior..I love the backup camera..the navigation..Getting about 20 mph in the city.
This my first SUV and I looked at them all!
Edge, Explorer, MB ML350, SRX, BMW X3, X5...Took my time too. I''ve been looking at the Jeep sense this model first appeared.
Anyway, I thought for the value, options, etc this was a great buy!
