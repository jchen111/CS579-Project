Bought this after salesman said this was 4WD (says so on vehicle) had no way of testing since it was bought in July. took to Outer Banks in NC and got stuck twice. Attempted lock in as manual says and still did not help. Transmission fluid overheated and had to sit and wait for it to cool down. Friend driving a Rav4 was able to drive in sand better than we could and his is not 4WD. Was able to dig out once and then had to be towed once.  Even letting air out to less than 20lbs did not help with getting through sand

Might be better in snow butnot looking forward to testing out.

We got our pilot about 1 month ago.
 We love the interior room, and it tows boats great.
The rear cargo area has plenty of space with the rear row of seats folded away.
Gas mileage has been consistently around 18, with mixed city and highway driving.
Best mileage was about 24 hwy, worst mileage was 17 towing, not on highway.
I will update the review as I have the suv longer.
