Was looking at 3 row SUVs to fit the new twins and the dog.
Decided on the Pilot over the CX-9 because of cost and dealership.
For utility and storage and seating, the Pilot is great.
However I feel it lags when it comes to acceleration, even compared to our 2012 CRV.
It definitely drives like a truck.
Having a little regret because I only use it to drive the whole family once every couple of weeks.
Would rather have something more fun to drive.
I'm also finding the seat even with all its adjustments, difficult to find the right position as of yet (1 month).
