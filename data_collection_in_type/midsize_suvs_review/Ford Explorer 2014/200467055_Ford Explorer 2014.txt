I traded in my 2011 charger r/t and 1500 silverado for the explorer sport and my wife couldn't be happier.
The sport handles superbly in the horrible snow storms in the Rocky Mountain Region.
The sport seems as if it is almost as quick as my charger r/t.
The sport is really fun to drive and fits all sorts of stuff for my young family.
The fuel economy is very misleading; on a road trip of approximately 1200 miles round trip, I averaged 18 mpg, which made me a little upset considering 22mpg is what is advertised.
Overall it is
a wonderful vehicle; it's fast enough for me, comfortable and safe for my family, and it fits all of my kids' stuff.
