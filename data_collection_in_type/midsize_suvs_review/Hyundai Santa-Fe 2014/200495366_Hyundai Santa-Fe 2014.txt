researched and test drove 12 different mid-size SUV's with3row, including acura mdx, and lexus rx350. 2014 santa fe beats them all
warranty, value, power, MPG, looks, and most features for the money. $36,000 for a fully loaded AWD GLS, the mdx will cost you 51K, and still not have all these features, such as panoramic roof ( huge) and ventilated front seats, and heated rear seats, and heated steering wheel. 
Hyundai has improved all aspects of there lineup, we own 3 in our family now
700 miles on it, and no issues, love it

I did so much research before finally making a decision on an SUV. I am so excited and pleased with the Santa Fe! I purchased a GLS with the Premium and Tech packages, and I could not be happier. The build quality, look and feel, and handling are such a huge leap over my 2011 Highlander Limited. I could not be happier.

We added this to our 2013 Sonata after the other midsize SUV we lease was bought back by another manufacturer as a lemon.

We are incredibly impressed with all of the features in this car.
It looks great, rides nicely, if a bit firm, has tons of room for 2 car seats and all the stuff that little kids come with and great technology.


I admit that the panoramic sunroof was one of the biggest selling features.
If you haven't seen it - you must - it beats all other competitors.

The only demerits I give are on the telescoping steering wheel - wish it came back a little more and the rear view camera - the lines do not move when you turn the wheel - which is weird as the Sonata does.
