I have major issues with my transmission at 11,000. Also still have extra travel while braking on uneven surfaces (city roads) and that is after recall

We purchased a new 2013 Pathfinder Platinum AWD.
3rd gen CVT.
You would think Nissan would have figured it out by now...NOT!!!
By the time we had driven 4000km the car had been in the shop twice to reprogram the transmission.
By 6000 km, in the shop two more times, but with a new transmission.
Within 500 km after the new transmission was installed, the same drivetrain vibration.
Nissan Canada says "It's a good car...we'll fix it"
We said you have wasted too many hours running a vehicle back and forth from the shop.
We lost 10k on trade in, and bought a 2013 Lexus RX350 F Sport.
Wish we had bought the Lexus in the first place!!

This is my 4th Nissan vehicle since 2003 and my first purchase.
The previous three vehicles were leases and I enjoyed them all.
I picked the '13 PF PL over the competitors for many reasons including: Nissan reliability, Nissan's CVT is the best among the other's out there, brand loyalty, standard features, ride quality, cargo space and technology.
I have just over 1200 miles so the vehicle is over the break-in period.
I am averaging 23.6 MPG with a 66 mile round-trip daily commute consisting of 90% highway and 10% city.
I have not experienced one issue and thoroughly enjoy my new '13 PF.
Build date is April 2013.

Absolutely Love this vehicle.
Bought 3 weeks ago, I average 25K miles a year, and so far it is wonderful with no problems.
Does not have the power of my previous Titan V8, but for a V6 with a CVT Transmission, it does great for my needs.
Researched Ford Explorer Limited and Pathfinder, mulled over all the blogs, comments and bottom line for me, the Price for the vehicle & all the Premium Platinum features verses the Ford Explorer Limited, along with the "trade Value" three years from now, Nissan won this buyer over again.
Especially love the remote start and heated/cooled seats.
So Far So Good!!
360 camera view also a neat feature!!

I have been reading the latest reviews on the 2013 Pathfinder and find them a bit disappointing. I bought mine yesterday and have 25 miles on it. I hope and pray I DO NOT have transmissions problems! I have been through transmission issues with a 2002 Ford Explorer and they were never rectified. I fell in love with this car after driving the Infiniti JX. I have the fully loaded Platinum. We read the reviews prior to buying and were so worried that the dealer included the 7yrs, 100,000 miles coverage on the engine and transmission.
I hope the issues are in the minority and do not show up with me.
If they do I hope Nissan can rectify the problem and take care of their customers.

I was looking for a family car with 3 rows so i looked at the Acura MDX which starts at the price i bought the pathfinder fully loaded, the Mazda CX-9, and the
Infiniti JX. The JX would have cost $15k more fully loaded with only having a little more features like Lane Departure Warning which isnt worth $15k. The CX-9 and MDX dont compare when it comes to size. I am 6' and still have leg room in the 3rd row. The tech is great and its comfortable. Very minimal road noise it still wows me to this day. i normally drive about 80-85 and it feels like nothing in this. 4WD is also excellent. I get 19.7 mpg but again i drive 80-85. The 14 Speaker Bose beats hard and the tv's are great for the kids.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purchased the Platinum about a month ago to replace my aging 2004 Volvo XC90.
We just returned from a 1,000 mile round-trip to Canada and the ride was comfortable and quiet. First thing I noticed is that there is definetly more room in all 3 rows than the Volvo. Navigation was great, along with techno-goodies, like bluetooth audio, Sirius/XM and the tire pressure monitor. MPG improved from 22.5 to 24.5 for the return trip home.

After a couple of months of research, what you are basically getting with the Platinum is an Infiniti JX35 minus the softer leather and lane departure warning. Here in Northern NJ, the difference was $9,000 so the my decsion was easy. You will not be dissapointed
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I noticed that every time i step on the gas from stop the car feels like auto transmission shifting/jerking and the RPMs drop suddenly from about 3500 to 2500. The dealer is saying that it's normal but I don't trust them. Does someone else experience the same jerking problem?

Also it's a shame that the car doesn't have Blind spot monitor. All competitors have it.

!!BUYERS BEWARE!!
-I purchased/picked up a brand new 2013 Nissan Pathfinder Platinum on Friday, 02/22/2013 at about 8:30pm, thinking that it should be the best car for me and my family. On Saturday, 02/23/2013 at about 7:00pm the navigation monitor black-out. Meaning, all infotainment, entertainment, GPS, and many other computer controls are all non-operational. I'm now very doubtful to continue to drive this car. Who knows what other problems will rise next. I even called up Nissan Consumer Affairs and they are helpless. Nissan corporate just don't care for their consumers. I'm now without a car to drive for 3 days and another week in pending, or possibly longer. I'M SCREWED by NISSAN!!

This car is very comparable to the Infinity JX. The JX has some high technology features that are not offered in the Pathfinder, but costs about $9k more. One of these features is the blind-spot warning. Unfortunately, Nissan offers the blind-spot warning as an option in the Altima, but not in the Pathfinder.
