We have had it for a month now. We had a 4 hour trip to see family and with a head wind for much of it still got just over 24 MPGs! We can slide the second row back so our two kids in car seats don't kick the back of my seat. Getting nieces and nephews into the 3rd row is nice because you can just slide the middle row up even with a big carseat! The transmission was a concern, lots of people moaning and groaning there. It feels different, BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT.The "stutter" described is likely just a result of inconsistent pressure on the gas when accelerating. I have tried to get the tranny to act up and if I press down, then let up then press down again it "transitions" gears but no prob

So far after 2 months and 1600miles...
Cracked valve cover dumped oil all over our driveway.
On a mountain road shifting into low did nothing, the mechanic at the dealership verified the problem, but Nissan's official response is that this is the way the CVT works and that's it.
On that problem and response alone we are trying to get our money back.
Now we are experiencing the "Jutter" problem everyone else has been complaining about.

Just picked up a 2013 SL on Friday and have 111 miles on it. For unfathomable reasons, Nissan gives you a 6-CD player on the entry level Pathfinder, but only 1-CD player on the more expensive models!! The mileage so far is around 18.8, but I hope this picks up to promised 22 combined. I have not yet taken it on a flat highway to see if I get the 26 mpg promised. Happy with it so far, but the 1-CD changer is irritating on a car that lists for more than $36,000. Another puzzle at first was the radio no longer has the "SAT" button, so, at first, we thought we didn't have XM radio.
