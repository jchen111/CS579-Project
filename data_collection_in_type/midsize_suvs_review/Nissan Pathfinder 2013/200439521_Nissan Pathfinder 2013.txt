We bought our '13 Pathfinder SL 4WD in August of 2013.
Within two months we started to feel the CVT Transmission shuddering under light throttle applications.
We had the car in the shop four times for this issue, but they could never replicate the problem.
After the shuddering started to become progressively worse and became a safety concern, we finally asked the dealer to buy the car back for the balance of our loan.
Happily, they agreed, and we were given $6000 more than the Kelly Blue Book trade value.
Other than the transmission issue, the car was very nice.
It rode great and got very good MPG for a mid-sized CUV ....

Bought this car in June 2013 because i liked the style and had owned Nissan in the past. First week already had some transmission rattling issue, in which Nissan still does not have a solution. In 6 months already have 2 recalls. And most recently the front bumper cracked for no reason. The expert in the bodyshop said that material is very flimpsy and would crack easily.
Terrible experience with this Pathfinder and this maybe the last Nissan I will ever buy.

I bought my 2013 PF, SL, 4x4 premium in June 2013.
I have almost 2,000 miles on it so far and it is the funnest SUV I've ever owned.
Absolutely comfortable inside and plenty of room for my two kids.
Lots of fun gadgets and great has milege.
I haven't had any problems with anything and have absolute trust in the Nissan name.

The Pathfinder was not originally on my list, gravitating towards the Mazda CX-5 due to sportiness and fuel economy. When I took the 15 & 17yo boys to look at the new car, they sat in the back of the Mazda and declared, "no way". 

We headed up car dealer row trying out similar vehicles: Mazda CX-9, Hyundai Santa Fe, Subaru Outback, Toyota Highlander, Chevy Traverse & Equinox, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Dodge Journey, Ford Edge and Explorer.

Of all those that "fit", the Nissan had the best fuel economy, and the most attractive interior. It's just plain a comfortable ride, with near luxury interior and nice soft leather seats. Good since I was replacing an Escalade and Jaguar with the Nissan.

There are always lemon cars and lemon dealers out there of which I do not have either.
So 4 months and 4000 miles mine is going strong no problems! The CVT transmission is different and will bog down if you try to floor it you have to give it gas steadily and before you know it you are passing someone uphill going 80mph! I live at 7500ft elevation in Colorado I have had no problems with power or passing and it handles great in the snow. I have averaged 26mpg on all of my tanks since buying this car.
Its a 7 passenger SUV that handles like a sports car! Much better than the 05 Xterra I traded in! That was a tank!

I have had my 13 Pathfinder now for approx 6 months and 5000 miles and everything is running beautifully. The leather seats are very comfortable, especially on long trips. The AC is been outstanding during these last few weeks of high heat. I barely notice the CV transmission now, handling is responsive in the city and on the highway. Overall mileage is much better than my last SUV - a Mazda CX9 V6. I would highly recommend this vehicle.

I bought my 2013 Pathfinder on April 19 and have just put 1000 miles on it. Since buying it it has shuddered at least a half a dozen times. The shudder lasts for about 2 to 3 seconds usually while trying to accelerate from a slow roll. The car has no power while the shudder is going on. Very Dangerous! I brought the car to the dealer and they told me that Nissan is aware of the problem and that it can take approximately 2 weeks to 2 months for Nissan to come up with a solution. I told the dealer that the car is unsafe to drive. They told me that Nissan told them that the car is safe to drive and that I need to ÂfloorÂ the gas pedal when accelerating to bypass the shudder issue.

I read some negative reviews on this car. But I figured most people who review cars have probably had a bad experience, and were not the majority. I guess I learned a hard lesson. We bought the car 23 days ago. It has been in the service department for 16 of those days. It has broke down 3 times and had to be towed back in. The last week it was in the shop they had no answers for us. Today they informed us the are ordering a new engine control unit. I am not typically a complainer, but this has been beyond frustrating. The dealership (Nissan Uftring in Peoria) have been terrible communicators. My wish is they would just buy the car back. Unfortunately I don't think that is going to happen.

We bought the new 2013 Nissan Pathfinder (SL version 45K) in January/13. By now, the SUV broke down 4 times: transmission hose fell off (the car had to be towed), overdrive did not work from the beginning, front lights burnt out, trunk door rubbed paint off the car due to bad alignment. All of these are manufacturing defects. We highly recommend this vehicle if you like to drive dirty service cars or unsuccessfully deal with Nissan Customer Service. 
Nissan is very proud of their design and manufacturing and believe that there is nothing wrong with the vehicle. Bravo Nissan Canada!

Traded up to a Pathfinder SL Premium for more size and more power over the 08 Outback.
Love the power and don't feel the speed with the quiet ride & lack of shifting gears. I really needed the extra space in the rear more than third row seating, but it's handy when the office goes out for lunch or on a site visit. The extra shoulder & hip room is appreciated!

I got the arctic blue metallic - a darker medium blue - with black interior.


I'm driving in the mountains on open, winding country roads, getting 20-21 mpg.

Got the car for $300 under Invoice plus Kelley Blue Book value on our trade.
