I bought my 2013 Santa Fe almost 2 months ago. I love all the features that come with the technology package, however I must say I'm a little disappointed. After having the car for 2 months, Hyundai advised me that my radio went out. Are you kidding me? The car is only a year old. So I've gone a few days without a radio, until it can be ordered. Thankful for the warranty, but I worry what will happen after the warranty end. Other than that, the car has seemed to run good.

I bought my 2013 Santa Fe Sport in August of 2012.
I was the second person in Kentucky to own this model.
Anyway, I've hard my Santa Fe for nearly two years now and I still love it!

I have taken my car to Florida on three trips (1400 miles round trip), I do a lot of driving in town, and take weekend trips in it.
I haven't had a single problem with my car and now have over 25,000 miles on the odometer.
The interior still looks like new, the paint still looks new, and the cabin is extremely quiet, even at high rates of speed.


If I had it to do over, I would definitely buy this Santa Fe Sport again.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really want to love this car. I love the exterior and interior design and all the features it has.
For these reasons, I would say the car has good value.
HOWEVER, I have had the car not even 2 weeks and cannot get used to the 4 cylinder, which I'm assuming is the reason the car has NO pick up.
It takes too long to get going every time I have to accelerate and this makes me dread every single traffic light/stop sign.
Maybe it is because I am coming from the 6 cyl. tuscon, but it just doesnt seem like enough power for an suv.
I dont remember my test drive being like this so I'm tempted to go drive another one at the dealership andsee if it's a problem with my car. Anyone else have this?

We've only had our Santa Fe Sport for a month but so far so good.
So this review is about my experience dealing with Hyundai. In shopping for the Santa Fe, we found out that they are very limited on their availability for certain models.
We were looking for Santa Fe Sport in Cabo Bronse with the popular package.
There was NOT ONE in California.
I also found out that there were only 3-4 in the state with these specs with colors only in white, black, and silver.
The dealer said they can get our choice color, but the could not, so please research and shop around before buying.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The beige dashboard panels glares horribly off the windshield.
Check this out before you buy.
Maybe you can ignore it - I can't.
I have put a black towel over the panel to the left of the steering wheel to knock out the glare.
And awful blind spots, particuarly on the driver's side.
I had to put a "blind spot mirror" on outside mirror.
Hyundai should be put in those "blind spot warning lights" in the future.
These are the only two things I have to say against this car.
Otherwise, I love it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After looking at several different SUVs, we decided upon the Sante Fe.
You will be challenged to find a different SUV with the options provided on the Sante Fe.
The passengers in the back also have heated seats that they control; very nice.
The steering is crazy sensitive, and the mpg is no where close to the advertised or what is displayed on the dash; do the math! (#miles / #gal put in).
Overall, disappointed Hyundai STILL having mileage issues.
I commute weekly (120 miles round trip).
The average mpg shown on the dash is always higher than the actual by 3-5mpg!
Been to shop multiple times and dealer agrees there is a problem. overall, I average 22mpg
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We put on about 1500 miles on it so far. Great interior and exterior design. It's very quiet, more so than the CRV and RAV4.
It's very comfortable and smooth. There are blind spots, but if you pay attention and add a blind spot mirror (and actually turn your head to look like you're suppose to), then it's not that bad.
MPG is 18-22, 27-31 in the highway, with a 24 avg, depending on the condition. Had to replace the gas tank due to a melted hose,w which caused the gas pump to shut off thinking it's full, but no problem since. Overall, we're happy and satisfied with the car, but the long term eval is still to be determined.

Where to begin? This SUV has been nothing but trouble since rolling it off the lot. I've been in for warranty work 3 times in two months, with more scheduled next week. In fact, I've driven more rentals and courtesy cars since owning this than the car itself. Issues I encountered: rear heater only blows cold air, the back window simply
shattered had to have replaced (no lie), lumbar button mounted improperly, and only went one way, dash display intermittently cuts in and out, the bluetooth quality is atrocious, the trim paint in the interior will chip off if even breathed on too hard, It wouldn't even turn over twice, still more to list! Beware of this ride. It's riddled with defects
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My hubby bought this car in October. Overall we like it, but there have already been some issues.
It took two visits to repair the driver in-seat heaters (finally they put in a new heating unit). After two visits the rear vents still don't work. Once or twice we've got them to blow mildly warm air but it couldn't be called heat - and we live in Minnesota. The backseat passengers feet freeze.
And, finally, the radio display locks up while playing from an iPod.
I am planning on purchasing a car for myself soon - and the lack of warmth in the back of the vehicle is a deal breaker for me. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have owned this car for 1100 km's and so far the two front seats needed to be repaired as they came lose and wobbled.
 But my biggest problem is the car has no heat in the rear vents.
An issue for car owners in Canada!
Took it to the dealership and they said it was a design issue and nothing they could do?
So, I am stuck with a car that doesn't heat the back-half of the car.
Actually it blows cold air, which makes it worse.
The car looks great, but stay away from this one, looks are deceiving.
