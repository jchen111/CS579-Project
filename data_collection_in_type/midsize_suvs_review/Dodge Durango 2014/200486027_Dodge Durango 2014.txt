I bought my Durango in February of 2014.
Like the previous reviewer mentioned, it was my dream machine too.
I really enjoyed driving it.
My only criticism was that the inside storage capacity is compromised by having a DVD player in the compartment between the two front
seats.
However, soon after, I noticed that during hard acceleration, my RPMs were going up without the car actually accelerating.
Took it to the dealer, and was told that the steering column is defected, and that can affect the transmission, as well as abs breaks, which could make the car dangerous to drive.
It has been 5 business days since they ordered a part, and the part is still on backorder
