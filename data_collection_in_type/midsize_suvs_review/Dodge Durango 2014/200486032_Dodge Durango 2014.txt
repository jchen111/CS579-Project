All in all after 2 months of ownership this vehicle has been absolutely outstanding.
For my needs (suburban tasks, weekend fun) its exceeded my expectations.
Very high quality, ergonomic interior that is comfortable and utility orientated as a daily driver.
But for me the clincher is the road dynamics - taut handling and the Hemi that kicks in at all the right moments brings a smile every time.
I do know its not a mid-engine exotic (at 5300 lbs) but for a domesticated male this is superbly satisfying!
Do not take my word for it - test drive it if you can find one (R/T).

Been in the market for a 3 row SUV for over a year.
I waited for the new Chevy Tahoe to come out - and it is really nice but very expensive.
Read great reviews on the Durango, test drove it and thought it was the best bang for your buck.
The styling is aggressive and the inside is refined.
Looked at the GMC Acadia as well and it was just "ok" - the wow factor was not there.
The Durango has it.

I put reliability at 5, but to be honest I have not had it long enough to really rate it - I guess I'm hoping it will be a 5.

After about a year of vehicle research we decided on The 2014 Dodge Durango R/T AWD. I could not be happier with the decision. The Durango is everything anyone could need. My family of four rides very comfortably anywhere we go. The kids love the dual entertainment screens in second row. I love my Alpine sound system, and my husband loves the hemi. I love that we are able to tow a boat, drive safely in the snow, and take long trips comfortably. The gas mileage isn't the best, but what would you expect with the Hemi?

My lease of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Ltd was expiring and since my family was expanding, I required third row seating.
I was going to return to a European nameplate such as GL550, but since I had had no problems with my Jeep, I had to consider the Durango.
While the Durango is not as luxurious as a Mercedes or Audi, one still gets good value for the money.
My RT AWD is fully loaded (Tech Pkg, Rear DVD, etc) and costs significantly less.


The RT sits a little lower than a comparable Citadel and feels firmer when on the road and while going through turns.
Its very smooth on the fwy with minimal road noise and the 8 speed shifts effortlessly.
