I've had this Durango Limited AWD model for 2 months and 3000 miles. I compared to Highlander, Pathfinder, and Acadia, but $6500 in incentives lured me to the Durango. Love the styling of the back of the SUV, not so crazy about the usual Dodge look of the front. Have had issues with the Tire Pressure Monitoring system that took 3 trips to the dealership to resolve (software). Overall MPG is 24, which is great for a car this size. Has a smooth but firm ride. The electronic interfaces in the car are great. Lots of nice interior lighting touches. Beware CD player is an option and is placed in the center console, not the dash. The more I drive it, the more I like it.
Just hope it's reliable.

Been buying Japanese cars for decades - and when the wife's Honda Pilot was ready to be traded in - assumed we would just go with a Pilot.
Unfortunately the Pilot's reviews kept talking about the EVO vibration that quite honestly was a deal killer for me - not to mention it is due for a refresh.
When looking for 3 row SUV's, we tried a few of them -
GMC Acadia, Nissan Pathfinder, Toyota Highlander and the Pilot.
None of them came close in terms of looks, styling, functionality and muscle. Of course I am concerned about the long term reliability, but this model seems to have been greatly improved since being introduced, and reliability has been decent with the 2011 and up models.

I recently bought the 2014 Dodge Durango after 8 months of researching it.
Wanted the R/t but
I ended up purchasing the Limited Trim level which to my surprise had a Hemi!
I believe that the Limited trim level with the Hemi is a great value for all the features you get, almost like having a Citadel Minus extra chrome and rain sensing wipers but at a much cheaper price!
 I had to get used to the gas mileage which is to be expected with a V-8.
The Uconnect is awesome, though I had some issues with the bluetooth pairing, keeping my phone paired.
This is largely due to the software being capatible with iOS 6 and not 7 (apple users). Updates are to come for that. Other than that I love It!
