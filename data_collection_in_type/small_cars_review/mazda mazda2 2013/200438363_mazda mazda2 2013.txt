What can I say, this car is just surprising! It really gets better the more you drive it. It is rock solid and it's standard Yokohama tires glue it to the road and is especially secure in fast, tight, turns. This coupled with the amazing suspension makes you feel secure and completely in control at all times. Don't believe the video review BS on YouTube about this thing being underpowered. It's not! It's a perfect balance of horsepower to weight ratio logic. Dont take my word for it. Test drive one and your will be surprised! It may not have the best storage or tech goodies but if you want to fall in love with the Fun Factor of driving every day this is the one! It has the fun fun zoom zoom!
