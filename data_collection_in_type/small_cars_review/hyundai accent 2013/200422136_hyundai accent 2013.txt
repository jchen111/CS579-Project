I had this car for about 2 weeks.
Only had 10k miles on the odometer.
I put about 1000 miles on the car.
At first this vehicle did not impress me.
This is by far the smallest cheapest car I have ever driven.
However the highlights are the seats, the stereo, and shiftronic automatic.
This car turned out to be quite comfortable even for a 4 hr drive.
However I had a problem with this car.
One day the turnsignals quit working.
Checked everything and everything else works fine.
I believe there may be a problem with the modulation control for the turnsignals in this model I had.
In all this car seems like it would be a solid buy other then the one issue.

My 2013 Accent has the most uncomfortable drivers seat I have had in 45 years.
My husband has the 2008 Accent with lumbar support and I have no problem driving his.
After only 30 minutes of driving mine I have a backache and headache.
I have tried numerous fixes (pillows, lumbar screens, towels) and nothing has helped.
I contacted Hyundai and I got a case number and was told to call my dealer.
His recomendation was to but a new $1000 seat or trade up to an Elantra. (is he crazy?). This is our 7th Hyundai and we loved them.
Why were the seats redesigned without the lumbar support?
And why doesn't Hyundai offer me any suggestions?
