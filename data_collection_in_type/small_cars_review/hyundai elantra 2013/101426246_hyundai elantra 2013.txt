This is less a review of this model than of Hyundia in general.   In this case, I'm talking about the program to repay customers for when they overstated their EPA estimated mileage.  1st, they "average" the mileage between city and highway.  Not so bad, except that they "round" the result to favor themselves.  By high school math, whenever you get ".5", it gets averaged upwards.  They average it downwards.  Thus, for my 2013 Elantra, they were off by "1.5" mpg, so the averaged it to 1 mpg instead of 2.  Then they make it very annoying to collect.  For example, they don't send you a check, they use a "debit" card which you can't use without looking up your VIN #.  Who carries that around?

 they are replacing my rear axle for free. If I had rotated my tires like I should have I wouldn't have found out that my rear axle was bad. I had 1 rear tire with extremely odd wear, took it in and they found my axle was made very badly, had I rotated them like I should have, the wear would have been minimal and almost unnoticable on all 4 tires.

I've owned this car for almost 7 months so far.
At 16K miles the brakes started to make a strange noise, I thought that it must be due to the extreme cold temperatures we've been having.
NOPE, at 17k miles I'm being told that my brakes need service, and guess what it's out of pocket!
Never mind that this car is driven 80% highway with limited use of brakes (no heavy traffic).
Dealer treats this as NORMAL.
I've had a mazda3 which only needed brakes every 60Kmiles.
At this rate I'll be changing brakes every 8 months!
Very poor design Hyundai.
You may have just lost a(nother) customer.
