I purchased a '14 LT Turbo Hatch 6-spd manual (option not shown) 7" MyLink, fog lights, upgraded rims and rearview camera with the upgraded red crystal color for $16.4k before taxes.  

While waiting for that vehicle to be delivered, I have been driving an LT sedan with the 1.8 auto and have still been impressed.  I'm getting 40.4MPG according to the computer on my 46 mile round trip commute in warm temps.  

I even got to test out the airbags when a woman made an illegal turn in front of me and I hit her going 35 mph.  Car performed great in the crash and the headlights were still even intact.  I think it's going to be a safe car - very strong steel frame. I'm glad it was just a loaner!
