I have the Ford Focus SE. I bought it with an automatic transmission that I paid $1300 for. 6 months later I find out it has a manual transmission with 2 electric clutches that no longer work. In 1 year the transmission, clutch, alternator, steering and interior have been repaired. My "automatic" transmission performs so poorly that I feel unsafe in the car. Do not buy this car. Once you own it, no one can fix it. It also depreciated 70% the first year. When it was 9 months old I was offered $7500 to trade it in. I paid 23K

The car has transmission problems and Ford will not stand behind them. Search the web and see the problems. As en engineer i am saying make another choice!!

Have 13,000 miles now. I've driven new foreign cars for the past decade, and this is by far my favorite car. I feel like I stole this car from Ford it was such a good value.  I get 35 mpg combined which is above EPA. Mine is a manual SE w/ sport package.  Highly recommend this combo if you're concerned about reliability of SYNC and the auto transmission.  I didn't mind the auto, but heard about technical issues, so I just avoided.  The 5 sp manual isn't the best, isn't the worst.  Nice clutch feel.  The sport package upgrades to nice firm seats.  I love them, but might be too firm for some.  The car feels lightweight but incredibly solid and well built.  Quiet and smooth on the freeway.
