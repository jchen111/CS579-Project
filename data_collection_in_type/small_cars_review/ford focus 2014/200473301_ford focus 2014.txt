This model was a basic, however by 50k miles was showing tranmission issues.  Could be a lemon could be beaten up by another driver.  However this model slipped in and out of drive and reverse.  Performance was bad because the transmission slipped.  Once the transmission caught up it was decent in preformance.  Other then some issues this vehicle may have been a nice vehicle.  Ample interior space, decent seats, good size trunk, and easy to drive.

I have always driven Hondas and Toyotas, this is my first Ford purchase and I absolutely love the car.
 I did a lot of research, test drove many similar priced vehicles and I loved my Focus the moment I test drove it.
The car has great visibility,
engine is very quiet.The transmission is a little slow to react at times, but that could be because I am used to driving a clutch. The engineers at Ford really put a lot of time into many of some of the little details a few examples, you can roll the windows up after the car has turned off, and the radio stays on until you open the door.
I am overall very pleased with both my car and the buying experience.
Highly recommend this car.

I had a 2005 focus that I loved, fun to drive, very dependable, and an all around great car. However the 2014 I purchased 3 months ago, is NONE of these. I have had it back to the shop 2 times, when stopped in traffic, it acts as if it is flooding out, then when you press the accelerator the engines revs to 4000 rpm and the transmission kicks in and you jump forward. Very unsafe. It also seems to stall out when you try to go up a hill. They keep telling me it is their new double clutch design and after driving it 5000 miles it will adjust to my driving. WHAT, is there to adjust to, I push on the accelerator I want to go, pretty simple. Ford needs to buy back all of these. They are unsafe!!!
