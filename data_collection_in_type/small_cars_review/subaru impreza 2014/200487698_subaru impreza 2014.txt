I bought my Impreza brand new and now have about 3,000 miles on it. So its still very new. However I am averaging
31MPG on the mountain roads of Vermont. I was pleased to see that I got Power windows, power locks, bluetooth, aux/usb, and a CD player in the basic model. I added the roof rack, spoiler, and mud guards which makes the car look good. I would recommend adding those if you are getting the base model, otherwise they look like a toyota matrix. As far as comfort goes its not to bad. I fit as a 6'2 205lbs man. The hatchback provides plenty of space for groceries and camping equipment..... If you are concerned with MPG and need AWD then this is a wise choice.
