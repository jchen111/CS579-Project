I purchased my a completely redesigned 2014 Forte in October 2013.
Now with 24k miles with it, I have no complain what so ever.
It has an adequate power and great gas mileage.
I get constantly 35 miles combined city and highway.
I cannot imagine any better car for what I paid.
I graduated from Honda Civics (3 previous generations) and have no regret.
Every time I park my car and I smile at the car to see how good it looks from front.

I am having the same issue as seen in this thread: 
http://www.forteforums.com/forums/noobie-questions-forum/39418-water-leak-trunk-compartment.html#post682049

The dealership couldn't figure out where the water was coming from and just dried out/cleaned my car without fixing anything. It appears to be coming from under the trunk liner and it is already starting to get more moisture/water just a few days after it was cleaned (only drove 10-15 miles since then). 

Brand new car bought in May 2013 that smells terrible even after the dealer removed the water and cleaned out the car. Hope this gets fixed the next time I bring it in...

I have had this about 2 weeks so far, and still like it, no buyers remorse.
I got the LX with Popular package because I wanted cruise control.
Back in 2010 when I bought my Corolla, I had looked at Kia but some of the cars seemed cheap.
The 14 Forte is a step up, with slightly bigger trunk and trunk opening than the 13, better seats (in my opinion), etc.
I recommend it over the 13 even though you pay more.

Wind noise okay, a little noiser than Elantra but a quieter than 13 Corolla or Sentra.
Trunk opening (important for me cause I have big briefcases, boxes, etc) was better than Corolla, and I didn't have to bend down as much as Elantra.
Sentra trunk & opening bigger and better though
