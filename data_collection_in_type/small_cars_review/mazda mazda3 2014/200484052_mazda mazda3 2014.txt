Fun to drive? Hell yeah! I love this car. Mostly!

After 2 years with an automatic (my first) I ditched it and went back to manual shift - with this Mazda3. Oof! And it was a good change. This is way more fun to drive than, say, my MINI (also manual).

I love it - it's got a great feel, good power, lots of fun. But there are a lot of details that are so close but not there! So, this is more fun to drive than the MINI, right? But MINI gets all of the details right on.

Excellent car.
2.0L 6M Touring w/o infotainment system.
Handling is precise, enabled by a decent engine and slick manual tranny,
Performed admirably in the great Buffalo blizzard of 2014.
ESC was great.
AVG 39MPG on the highway, and 34MPG in mixed driving.
Noise is minimal for the class.
Ride is superior for the class--feels like a luxury sedan.
Standard radio/speaker is plenty for audio.
I test drove the $1600 technology package and was not impressed.
Most of that value can be covered by any decent smart phone.
Overall an excellent, reliable vehicle, that excels as a true driver's car.
If you want to love your commute and not break the bank, pick up a Mazda 3.
