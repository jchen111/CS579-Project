I purchased the Elantra SE on June 8th and so far I have put about 4700 miles on it. It is a very comfortable car for my commute of about 50 miles round trip daily. I have taken several long road trips of over 300 miles with no issues. Over all I could not have asked for more from Hyundai. I am a loyal customer as I also own a 2012 Hyundai Accent SE.

I have a new car a 2014 Elantra. I found with less than 100 miles on it the speedometer was off by 3 mph. When it showed 35 miles per hour the car was only going 32 mph. I called Keys and took it in. They did their tests called Hyundai and did not fix the problem. I was told the car is with in limits. The dealer said they can not help it is up to Hyundai. So much for bumper to bumper coverage. I might have given a good rating but now every time I get into the car I have to speed to go the correct mph. How they can say it is with in limits when clearly the speedometer is off by 3 mph. I now wonder when something goes wrong what they will tell me why they won't fix it. Beware
