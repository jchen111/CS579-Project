I traded in a Chevrolet Sonic for this and my fiance and I share this car. I have the "no regrets" model with the Entune system with navigation, moonroof, and keyless ignition. I've only had it a few weeks but I can definitely say I like it. What attracted me to the car in the first place is the huge number of features for the money. I also wanted a car with a CVT if I had to have an automatic. Fit and finish are excellent and above what I expected for the price. The interior is comfortable and surprisingly spacious and attractive. My fiance and I both enjoy driving it very much. It also looks great, especially in slate gray, which I thought I'd never say about a Corolla.

I recently purchased a 2014 Toyota Corolla.
I really like the car, except for 2 concerns:
1.
the average mile/gallon on the sticker (highway & local) is inflated.
I've checked the web and apparently there is no federal oversight to ensure the correct mileage is posted.
2.
the car has 2 plastic "rods" that are on both sides of the car (vertically) clipped to the under-carriage.
Last winter during the snow, I was driving out of an icy spot an to my surprise, there was a long gray plastic rod on the road.
It was from my new car.
I have submitted a complaint to Toyota...poor quality and engineering. Maybe they'll recall and fix this issue.

I had a 2006 Camry SE V6 for eight years. I call my 2014 Corolla LE Premium my "mini-Camry". It's very spacious, has very comfortable seats, excellent handling (firm, but easily controlled) with high end Michelin Primacy 60K tires, very quiet overall (no wind noise), delivers 38 mpg on the high and 34 mpg in town, has excellent visibility, fit and finish. I love the instant/trip average mpg bar chart on the Infotainment Center. Bought it without the normally included moon roof and Entune radio ($2400 extra). Has surprisingly good acceleration; no problem passing anything on the road. Rear view camera is a terrific - should be on every car.
