This is an addition to my previous review. If you're looking for a sports car the 6-speed might not fit. Passing with the 6 speed can be a bit challenging, although its still capable. At 55 mph in 6th gear drop it into 4th and punch it to moderately pass on the open road. Do not challenge on coming traffic, give yourself room. When shifting from 5th into 6th ride the shifter to the far right as to not accidentally drop it back into 4th. A sloppy shift may end up going from 5th back to 4th. Also mind going from 4th to 5th as to not accidentally drop into 3rd. This advice applies to folks whom are new to driving manual transmissions, seasoned folks will not find this problem.

Purchased brand new in Charleston SC for $15,600. On flat roads at 60mph I am getting 44 mpg, I average 40 mpg going from work to home. I drive 40 miles one way and its half city half highway driving. Car is smooth and quiet, transmission is easy and smooth to shift. Engine is very quiet, its not a hotrod but picks up and goes rather nice. I had cruise control installed after market for $399 (manual trans does not offer cruise) and it works great, back seat has plenty of room for my infant and toddler rear facing car seats, trunk is roomy, 6th gear offers low RPM on highway speeds 60-70 mph is 1800-2500 rpm roughly. center console is comfortable as arm rest while driving, clutch feels smooth
