I bought my 2013 Dodge Dart SE in March of 2013. It had 10 miles on it. It is now almost October of 2014 and I have 43200 miles on my Dart. My work was a long commute, no longer thank God. 
I have had ZERO problems with this car. I did put a new set of TOYO tires on. 
Sorry to the folks that had problems.. Ohh.. I love the fact no worries about a stupid rubber timing belt every 80k to100 k. I just drive right and follow  manufacture recommendations.

I have had my Aero since December 2013.  I test drove almost everything in the class but settled on the Aero manual 6 spd 1.4L turbo based on price, options and fuel economy.  This car is fun to drive, handles great, and gets better than advertised mileage.  I have almost 20,000 on the car now and have taken it on several long road trips.  The seats are comfy, the power is great even on the highway, and it is a real treat to drive on mountain roads.  I can't understand the C rating here.  For the last week I have also been driving a 2014 Corolla S and I can't stand it.  The Dart has more pickup, better  mileage and handling, and more room.  All for about 4k less.

The base car does not come with AC. No power doors. You have to reach into the back seats to unlock. Cheap materials. For a stick shift with no other features, it is way over-priced. Within 4 days of owning and 150 miles, there was some problems with shifting gears. Errors are lit. I had to get rid of it as quickly as I could.

I got my dart when they first came out and loved it until at 911 miles all lights came on and the engine stopped. Took in to dealer they had it for 2 weeks and then told me they couldn't
fix it didn't know what was the problem with it. So they reordered me another Dart which took over 10 weeks to get. In rental car all this time. Wow finely got my other new Dart. Keep in garage for the winter now I have it back out on the road was doing good up to 6000 miles.Then when the tranny got heated up and would shift it would raz the engine up to high RPM's and thump really bad and not want to pull very well. So you guessed it back in the shop again.
This is really bad in second and fourth gear.

First, this is not a compact car.
It has more or similar interior room and trunk space as the Honda Accord coupe and the Chevy Malibu.
It is a midsized car at a compact car price and with compact car fuel mileage.
I almost bought a Focus, but the Dart was better equipped and had more space.
The Focus just cannot accommodate adults on a long trip, the Dart can.
Anyone who says the Focus interior is superior to the Dart's is blind.

 I own the SE with the manual, cruise control, and Uconnect.
The build quality was excellent, no bad panel gaps, paint, everything worked.
I have had it for 10 months, 2 long trips, 9,000 miles, and only oil and filter changes.

Ive got 5000 miles on this car and have had nothing but issues since day one. There has been a consistent rattle from the front doors that has yet to be fixed. My headliner is sagging and fraying. My interior brake light is falling down. The transmission dropped at 4000 miles. The dome light fell off and had to be taped up. My right rear turn signal chooses when it wants to work. This car has just been a piece of crap.

I have the lowest end car available that I picked up at a great price in January 2013. The design work on the car looks great inside and out. The interior is nicer than you would expect from a base model. The dashboard was designed for the nicer electronic touch-screen interface, which my car does not have, but the manual system looks nice and functions well. It has a roomy interior with adequate cargo, although smaller than expected. The car has a sporty feel while driving (especially with a 6 speed manual), but it does not reach advertised mpg, and can be somewhat difficult to shift smoothly at first. It cruises smoothly on the freeway and handles well better than similar sedans.
