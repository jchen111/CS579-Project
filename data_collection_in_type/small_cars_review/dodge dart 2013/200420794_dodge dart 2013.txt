Omg... This car turned out to be my worst nightmare. I purchased it on July 31, 2013, brand new, and it seems like as soon as I pulled off the lot, it went downhill from there. In April, I ended up having to get the alternator and a belt replaced. It locked up while I was driving, not to mention the fact that I was just about to get on the interstate for a trip. After that, I experience a burning smell for weeks. Ended up having to have the oil pan replaced. Now, here in August, my car won't crank. It keeps dying on me and one minute, it seems like the battery, the next someone is saying it's the alternator. I'm waiting for the verdict from the dealer now. In the meantime, don't buy Dodge!!

I just traded my Dart in so I figured I would write a review. I had a rally with the 2.0 automatic and only had 6,000 miles on it. I did purchase it new when they first came out.

On a good note I will say the interior was very nice and held up well. The touch screen is huge and very good view for the backup camera.

The exterior is another story and found it to be very cheap. The underbody plastic was starting to fall apart already on me and had to be removed. I also found that the paint seemed to be very poor quality, I wonder if it is a water base because it scratches and chips very easily.

Bought this car for my wife to drive to work (40 miles one way) Love the looks. But the car has been in the shop to much for a car that is just over a year old and 23000 miles on it. Trunk liner clips broke, was told they had to order whole liner. took it home that day and took grocery' out of trunk. Whey we closed it, they broke again. Heard it hit the trunk floor. Had the clutch cyld replaced as it would stay on the floor "TSB for this one" Now 3 months later and it back in the shop for the same thing. (Parts on national back order) had to beg for a loaner even though its still under warranty and I purchased the life time warranty. Engine was skipping was told needed oil change.

Well, let me just start off that my friend has a 2013 Dart with the California package. I have driven this car a few times now, and I must say I am very impressed with Chrysler. This car rides and handles very well. The fuel economy is AMAZING! No matter what the mpgs stay above 30. It has decent power for it's size. If you want the extra
power then go for the turbo. My friend has not experienced any problems as of yet, but let's be realistic. This car has JUST come out, a completely new vehicle, so it's bound to have a few issues. Overall I think it's a great car, and I
LOVE LOVE LOVE the styling. It's about time American automakers step up their game.

 The mud flaps drag on the ground every time I go into a driveway the front bumper does also. The front bumper drags even if I a lightweight female am the only one in the car. When it's cold outside the pressure gauge for the tires is a pain in the rear. It constantly goes below 27 and sets off the low pressure alarm which is extremely annoying when you know once it warms up a little it will go back to normal. When you get on the gas the muffler sounds really tinny. Like they put the cheapest muffler on it and it rattles like crazy. Speakers are horrible. Now I have begun to smell antifreeze and I have 38,000 miles on the car. No get up in automatic when starting off from a light.

I bought this new car because I wanted reliability as my last car was ten-years-old and I have a new baby. Since I purchased it a tire blew, the electrical has issues, the thermostat was faulty causing me to be overheated and stranded, the hose connecting the radiator is deterioating and leaking red coolant, and who knows what will happen next. I have had it six months and have been in the shop every month since. If you have money to waste this car is pretty enough, but don't rely on it it work.

After 22,000 miles I have had zero maintenance or quality issues, only oil changes (which are $60 due to synthetic oil requirement).
Plenty of power with a nice throaty exhaust note and a 33 mpg overall average.
Forty mpg is routine at 65 mph.
The magazine writers who whine about turbo lag with this engine are describing gear/rpm/speed situations no sane driver would use, such as 1500 rpm/4th gear/30 mph.
Use 3rd gear at that speed (2000 rpm) and enjoy snappy response.
This car is a nice combination of comfort, economy, power and sporty handling.

At first this vehicle was easy on the eyes with an affordable Ralley appearance package. It was before I made my first payment that things started to decline. Initially, my tires were losing pressure quickly and then the front passenger tire blew on my way home from work. There are a lot of electronic issues with gas gage, dimmers, and lights. At 6100 miles engine malfunction indicator came on, defrosters/heaters stopped working, and engine overheated in -8 weather. Dealership states faulty thermostat and flush needed. I'm not sure what else to expect in the future for my brand new car.

I rented one and wasn't impressed.
It beats a Civic but not a Mazda 3

To get a vehicle with better gas mileage, I
traded my jeep JK with 57 k miles for it. A little over a year later, I wished I had not done so. ItÂs a fun almost sporty little car to drive and the fuel economy is great.
The review would be much more positive except that when the car needed repairs the parts always seemed on backorder. So much so that in the last sixteen months I have been in rental cars of and on for over three months of it. For an economy car, when it runs, itÂs roomy exciting to drive and just plain fun, however even with my jeep getting half the mileage it was more reliable and in hindsight well worth the extra expense of the gas.
