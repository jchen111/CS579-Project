I have had my 2013 Civic EX Sedan now for over 6 months.
I initially had trouble getting comfortable in the seat but now that I have adjusted the horribly forward-tilted headrest and found a seat height and steering wheel adjustment that works for me, I find the car comfortable for my daily commute.
Other than that, the car is flawless so far and has that "Honda Feel" behind the wheel that only a Honda can provide in my experience - like its connected to you in someway and always seems to know what you want to do!

I love my 13 Civic EX Sedan. Alabaster Silver/Black Cloth. Mudguards. Shopping bag hooks. I have been really impressed as have family and friends. I am glad I didn't get the leather seats, which take longer to cool than black cloth, and I love everything about this car. As the satisfied owner of a 5-speed 1989 Civic DX Hatchback, an automatic 03 Corolla CE, and a 2009 Corolla XLE, all I can say is, Wow. 22,000 miles and loving it.

I got my Honda Civic EX about a month ago.
The car is amazingly quiet and handles very well around town and out on the highway - very stable at highway speeds.
The electronics are very easy to use and have sharp, bright graphics that make them a pleasure to use.
The Bluetooth system easily synced with my iPhone 4s.
The back up camera is great!
The only negative is the driver's seat.
I am 6-0, 180 lbs and it was extremely difficult to find a comfortable driving position.
The front of the seat cushion puts pressure on my legs and is very uncomfortable.
Pay attention to the seat feel when you test drive it.

I have never had a Honda Civic. I have and still have a 2004 Honda Accord EX which I gave to my daughter for college.
So far I have been totally impressed with this car except for the pick up power.
I have noticed the hesidancy in take off especially if you are on I-75 trying to go around a slow driver.
Going uphill it loses speed if you are not in cruise control. When I test drove it, wish I had taken it on I-75.
I am hoping like the 4 cylinder Camri that I had, this Honda will surprise me when I obtain more mileage on the car and have better pick up. Anyway I love the gas mileage!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Honda product is generally, well, you know, hard to beat, right?
I own this car now.
I am so very disappointed.
If they could remake the 1997 Honda Civic EX 5-speed with the Exact same materials they used back in 1997, that would make me very happy.
Keep dreaming, right?
I Miss the Old Cruise Control.
The 2013 is OK, but the 1997 Cruise Control I liked much better.
I Miss the Old Moon Roof on the 1997.
This 2013 is not superior at all.
The 1997 Moon Roof was superior because I could control the width and the placement of it was absolutely PERFECT.
Not so on 2013 model.
It's like I don't even have a moon roof, really.....

I am not sure why all the negative reviews on the 2013 Civic, I love my new Civic EX!!!
I especially love the 2 level speedo because I keep my steering wheel low so the high mount speedo actually works great for me.

And to the people that complained about
lack of power, quality of interior, etc, SHAME on you for not noticing during your test drive!!!!!

The Civic is not a perfect car,
but it suits me perfectly!!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the car performs excellent.
I am hoping for the Honda reliability. So far, gas mileage is excellent.
Interior ..... car is easy to navigate (viewing the
i-MID
system is .....
p e r f e c t ....
when compared to others.
It is clear, concise and simple.
Well done!
Bravo!
So far, a perfect car except I cannot give five stars on interior design due to the rattling noises I experience in the area of the controls for the CD player, volume button and it really annoys me.

The ride is comfortable. The noise level is reduced tremendously. Rear Windows -don't like feeling like I own a Dodge Avenger. Prefer a temp gauge-not icons. Get rid of split level dash board!! Get rid of digital speed. Prefer Odometer to include *simultaneously* Total Miles Driven & Trip Miles.
Poor Sun Visors-Poor quality. Poor Interior vinyl quality-cheap quality. Exterior Paint--Poor Quality. Prefer key hole on Passenger Door & Trunk. Hood construction is odd-- don't care for the leaf trap or sensors. Need a junk trap under the Hand Brake. Need more space on door panels.
All of the AC Buttons/AC Unit/Design is a Hazard (to me)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The consumer reviews don't lie. This truly is a great car. I would suggest not getting the hybrid because the regular car on the econ mode can get 45 mpg. 

I use to own a VW Passat and am indescribably happy to get rid of it for my new Civic. I will never stray from Honda or Toyota ever again. The Civic is fun to drive, has a lot of nice features (pandora interface, econ mode, back up camera, ect), and is reliable. 

I rented a 2012 Honda Civic when I was in Boston and was really impressed with it. I ended up buying the 2013 version since it's more refined. 

There is a reason you see so many Honda vehicles on the road...because they make a solid car that won't leave you stranded.

I test driven the 2013's Elantra GT, Mazda CX-5, Focus SE hatchback (hb) and Civic Ex. It finally came down to the wire between the Focus and Civic....

I thought over the need of a hb, and seemed compelling at first, I don't recall needing to haul a lot of stuff last several years, and if I did I rented a van a couple of times from Home Depot. Next, the hb looks nice, but reduces the rear viewing area. Overall, I felt the Civic has improved significantly.

MPG, long term cost of ownership, features and styling matters to me. The 2013 Civic nails them in pretty well.

I'm giving it a 4 star on value, since it now cost a little more after Ford's recent $2,500 factory incentive.
