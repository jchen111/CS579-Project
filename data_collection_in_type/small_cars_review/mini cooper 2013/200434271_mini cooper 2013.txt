Caution!
Don't drive your MINI in the rain!
I purchased a Mini Cooper S Countryman in July, 2013 from New Country MINI and have been very pleased until this past week.
I was unable to open the door electronically and upon entering via the manual system found that a number of electronics were not working, no ww wipers, no power locks, no speedometer and every conceivable warning light flashing.. Upon bringing it to New Country they diagnosed the problem as "water inside an electronic module" and repairs will cost $900.
No problem I thought MINI tells us what a great warranty and maintenance plan they have.
But guess what it doesn't cover water!!!
They say I opened up the passenger side

I'm a writer. It's what I do.
I've gone looking for the words to say about this car, and I can't find them. I'm instead overtaken by gusts of anger, confusion, and a general bitterness that this prop, this four-wheeled thing parading as a car, has consumed me this wholly. Look elsewhere.
Do not get this car.
Do not.
Get.
This car.
Just last week I racked up my twelfth (12th) service appointment in 15 months.
MINI has dealt with almost every problem I've submitted, aside from the car running out of oil at 5k and a wheel bearing coming off, by repeatedly denying their existence.
When they find a given problem, seven service receipts deep, they say it's "spec."
