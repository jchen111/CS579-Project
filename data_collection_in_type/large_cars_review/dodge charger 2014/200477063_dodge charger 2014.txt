As many may know they use Chargers as Police Vehicles, Well i know why now, The Charger has Lots of power and if You want some Luxury it has that too! Heated Seats both passenger and driver, And REAR HEATED SEATS! did i also mention a heated steering wheel and cooled seats too?? To add the icing to the cake an 8.4-inch touchscreen display And BI-Xenon headlights and Race-Track style taillights which are LED, Yes there is more, Optional Beats Audio, My charger came with a ALPINE AUTO SYSTEM which was very good. Overall this vehicle was AWESOME coming from a Teenager! but the Reliability Reputation is not so good. 8/10.

I traded my 2013 Dodge Challenger Rallye Redline, fully loaded, for a bright white 2014 Charger R/T, base model. I love this car. When I owned the challenger, I drove it like it had a hemi, on occasion. The charger 5.7 hemi, has so far gotten better gas milage than my 3.6 pentastar in the challenger. Handling is great, with regards to the size. Space is awesome. The 8.5 media screen is awesome. Acceleration is great.
