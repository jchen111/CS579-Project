I've had my Taurus for 6 mos and I love it! Nothing negative to report!!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The build quality of the new Ford Taurus is very cheap. If this car is driven for any time at all I can't see it lasting more than 4 years. The paint job is horrible! It will scratch at the slightest touch. The craftsmanship is of very low quality. Ford reverted back to the 70's when they built the Taurus. And, it's a shame because the design of the car is very attractive. I truly regret returning to Ford.

Simply the best, quietest, most comfortable car ever!
