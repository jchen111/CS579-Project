As of 841 miles, I am very pleased with my decision to go back to American Made!
The 2013 Chrylser 300 is a pleasure to drive.


It is so very quiet and smooth!
More so than my 2011 Honda Odyssey van (that has been plagued with problems).
The base model does exhibit a bit of "floatiness", which is attributed to the smooth and quiet ride.
But it's not a negative.

Compared to most cars on the market, it has a lot of room, especially in the rear passenger area.
Wish it had more in the driver's area for big guys like me.


For me, buying the base model and adding fog lamps and O.E.M 20" custom wheels to a car that was already feature rich... made sense!
$28,400
...out the door!

Picked up my new 300 with thew Popular Equipment group and Navigation in April, and have already done an 1100 mile round trip in the car with 3 people and all their luggage aboard.
Cruise Control set at 75MPH, and the Chrysler got an actual 31 MPG on that trip.
I didn't believe it, but the return trip yielded the same result.
The 300 was quiet as a Monday Morning Church, and power to spare, and the passengers couldn't believe how comfortable they were , and how little fatigue they experienced, on the 9+ hour car trip. The 300 was an effortless joy to drive, and the gas mileage was nothing short of amazing.

This is the 3 car i owned and i am in love with it. The design inside and out is elegant and gorgous. It has its own unique look that turns heads no matter where i am. Inside is as lugorious as it can get. Ive been in many high priced cars such as the benz e class and the Infiniti g37 and i'd say the interior on the 300 beats them! The power even on the v6 is very powerfull and ive beaten the new infiniti g37 and 35, cadillac cts, and audi a4. If your looking to cruize around and show off the car its great for that also, but if your asking for power the 300 shows it off remarkably. And for a price range that starts at 29g! Its crazy what Chrysler has done.Highly recommend this car to anyone.

I am a sales professional and choose over similar priced competitors.
In the low $30k price range this vehicle is the clear winner hand's down.
The US automakers are closing the gap on the other brands.
And what you get in this car and compared to the previous years 300 is night and day.
This is a really nice car.
It has a great turning radius, power on tap when you need it, decent brakes, it is quiet so you will be able to conduct business via phone and blue tooth if that is your thing.
Also compared to the Passat with its V6 and this is still the better value.
