It's rare when you buy something and it's better than you expect....but that's just what my 2014 Chevy Impala 2LTZ delivered....quiet on the road, 29 mpg, great Bose stereo, enough power on the freeway (a little short on acceleration but not much...wish they had a v8 up front)....in short, this car, over 18000 miles, has been a pleasure to drive and service at my dealer has been great....very, very happy with this car...and I used to own the big Mercedes and BMW's...while this car isn't one of those, it is a great value....if you're looking at the German autos, add the Chevy to your shopping list.

Purchased new in April of 2014.
20" GM wheels rub during low speed turns.
Two defective steering wheels - leather stitching falls apart.
Electronic parking brake will not disengage resulting in smoking brakes and red hot rotors + fire hazard.
Back-up camera display goes black when gear selecter placed in reverse.
Collision alert system false alarms when no vehicles are in the road in front.
Navigation system does not recognize voice commands and gets you lost.  Has trouble finding adresses.
The constant problems with electronics and wasted return trips to the dealership for repair make this a not recommend vehicle.  Got rid of it at 7500 miles and 6 months use.  Lost 50% Value.

Ok - this is admittedly a weird problem. The exterior forward facing chrome-colored plastic mirror trim has disappeared twice from the passenger side of my 2014 Impala. There is absolutely no damage to the remaining mirror so I'm pretty sure nothing hit it. I think it just fell off by itself. anyone else experience this?

This is a wonderful car.
I have owned this car for 4 months and have driven it 16,000 Km.
The controls in this car are well planned and laid out.
The voice activated controls and the controls on the steering wheel are great but unnecessary. My Champagne coloured car with the Mojave interior is striking.
People look and comment all of the time. 
The trunk holds everything a party of 4 adults can pack and the ride is still comfortable.

Winter tires are required on this car.
I live in a snow belt in Ontario, Canada and with proper tires I got through more snow than many drivers will ever see.
This is my 4th Chevy.
The last three travelled over 1 million Km without major repairs.

This car is a game changer for Impala. I have owned 14 Impalas since 2000 - my wife and I get one on alternate years. Mine is the LTZ and she has the LT2. The 2014 is by far the best yet. It does have a few flaws -- poor backup camera resolution, forward A-pillar blind spots, not great in snow/ice conditions. To me, this car is a far-weather vehicle and not designed for Winter driving. The 20" wheels are ok but tend to work poorly in snow/ice. Radio tuning is slow and lags when switching stations. Navigation ease of use is excellent.

Pros:
- Great exterior design
- Great interior design
- Got all the little things right

Cons:
- Got the most important thing wrong:
the ride is terribly uncomfortable.

Extremely stiff ride.
Feel every bump and road imperfection in the car.
Enough to make me hate getting in the car to drive anywhere.
Also feel much more engine vibration through steering wheel, frame, and seat than I would expect from this level of car.
There is enough vibration to give me headaches on my commute to and from work.
Dealership says it is normal for the car and thinks it rides smoothly.
If that's GM's definition of a smooth ride, then it is time to look elsewhere.

This is the first car that I have owned where I opted for all the options. I did so because General Motors did a great job with the redesign of the Impala. The previous editions of the Impala were lack luster as they had very little umph in the interior and exterior. Whereas this new Impala is awesome and eye dropping. For starters the spacious interior makes this a great car to travel in. The interior materials in this car are soft and supple and the way they blended the Mojave interior in my car is just amazing. The black, gray and peanut butter colors make for an awesome visual statement. I have room aplenty now.

We have
had our LTZ for 3 weeks now.
Being high gloss black with chrome, it is a real head turner. Has everything that most luxury cars have.
Huge trunk with roomy back seats that fold down for easy pass through from trunk.
 

We traded in our 07 Corvette and the Impala gives us the feeling of a sports car with the ride and comfort of a luxury car.
 Really love the back up assist and heated and cooed seats.
Once we saw this model we had to have one. Looked at lots of other sedans and for under $40,000 could not find one to compare.

On break in drive to Reno car handled perfectly.
On return trip ran into rain and moisture could be felt coming thru the air vents.
