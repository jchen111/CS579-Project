I am a previous Avalon owner of two Avalon's. They were good cars. Now I own a 2013 Avalon. The ride is very harsh with bumps being transmitted into the cabin as noticeable knocks. Road noise is terrible on worn asphalts and concrete roads. The head lights cut off to soon on low beam. The seats are very hard making a long trip unpleasant. I now wish that I had not purchased this car.

I purchased my 2013 Avalon XLE Premium 6 weeks ago. I selected the metallic black with tan interior.
I have gotten a lot of comments from friends, valets, and doorman on the car.
They are blown away with the look and feel of the car inside and out.
I commute 50 miles a day and now love my commute.
Traded in a 2004 Nissan Maxima LS.
While it was a great car it does not even come close to the style quality and performance of my Avalon.

I am a true believer and could not be happier with my Avalon!

The Avalon is nice and has a high quality interior look. But the things that you notice after you buy the car matter. The seats need some more cushion. We rode a couple hours before our bottoms hurt. My Corolla is a good 5 1/2 hour seat. Where are the bottle holders in the doors?
They are absent front and rear. So on a trip with three in the back with the armrest folded up, the rear seat passengers will not have a single place to store drinks. I like more than one drink myself, especially living in a desert area. I would also appreciate it if the two cupholders up front were cooled. Power is good in this V/6, Best mileage on a road trip with a full trunk and three passengers was 29.5 mpg hwy
