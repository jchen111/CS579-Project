I purchased the 2014 Cadenza in late June and immediately took a 2,500 road trip to California. The Cadenza is a very well behaved sedan that will turn heads and compete with the so-called big boys. I averaged over 30MPG for the trip and power was more than sufficient for my liking. The seats were extremely comfortable and I loved the seat coolers on both front seats, especially as we ventured into the 100+ degree Central Valley. I previously drove a 2002 Audi A6 and was tempted to go that route again, but for $20,000 less, I get fantastic mileage, same creature comfort, a beautifully designed exterior and easy to use electronics. I'll be interested to see how it holds up in the coming years

The car is unsatisfactory 
1) as it does not give the estimated mileage that was advertised on the window sticker and 
2) the engine does not have sufficient pickup.

3) The navigation on the car has been giving erroneous directions over the last several months.I took the car to Braman Kia for service. The service advisor is not knowledgeable nor competent. I had taken the car to resolve this problem and for a maintenance (oil change). I asked him if he could take care of both while I went to lunch and come back a few hours later. After I did, neither had been done on the car. The Kia service person did not know how to solve the navigation problem even after I explained how to.

Great responsiveness. Quiet engine. Loaded with extras.

Cannot find one issue and I'm a German car fanatic. This vehicle is perfect in every way from brakes, power, quietness, to build quality. Even KIA corporate has contacted me for my opinion.
This is a whole new game.
Its a no brainier and one of the few buying decisions I've made that I can say I made a great decision.
I own the car and I'm very direct in my thoughts.
