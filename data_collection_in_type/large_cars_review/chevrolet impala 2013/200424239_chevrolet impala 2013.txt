Most professional reviewers do not live with the cars they review.
It is all about style and handling.
Yes a BMW drives great and is beautiful but who can afford to maintain one.
This Impala provides a long list of features that make everyday driving much more enjoyable.
The price of admission is very affordable and they cost practically nothing to maintain.
I traded up from the 09 LT to the 13 LTZ.
In 85,000 miles of driving my 09 cost $125 for non regular maintenance cost.
The 13 LTZ is a bit firmer but the power from the 3.6 is amazing over the 3.9 of the 09.
Unless you plan on using this car to carve mountain roads do not be put off by the reviews.

After reading the review of the 2013 Impala on Edmunds one would foolish to buy this car, but don't be fooled its a great large vehicle. Large for todays scene, but not that large. 18 cu trunk and with the back seat folded down its able to carry a lot of cargo. 

The 3.6 twin overhead cam V-6 pulls like a modern V-8 with a firm ride. I bought the LTZ and it reminds me of my 1996 Cadillac Eldorado, except the Eldorado did not have a sunroof or heated seats. Gar mileage is good, not great, averaging 21 mpg in traffic and 28 mpg on the highway with regular gas - most high power v-6's require high test gas, not this one with direct injection (no turbo). 

$4000 rebate, you can't beat it !
