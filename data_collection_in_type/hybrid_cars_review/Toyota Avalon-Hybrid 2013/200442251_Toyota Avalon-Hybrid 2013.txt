I have been buying Toyotas since late nineties gave up on American iron. I love this car it is great! Wanted a hybrid and luxury this covers all the bases.
The ride is excellent the interior is plush and quiet outside is aggressive and has presence. The fit and finish is top notch and was a great value. Shopped around several luxury brands Mercedes, Lexus, BMW and infinity. None could come close to the included items and luxury for the cost.
The ride is supple and quiet acceleration is adequate for any driving situation. I commute 40 miles
each way and use a mix of highway and mountainous secondary roads and this car eats it up with ease. All this and I avg 38 mpg. Would recommend highly!

I was skeptical at first, but as many have stated, Toyota has been making hybrids for quite some time. Every person I know that owns a Toyota hybrid raves about their vehicle. That was the convincing point for me. The vehicle is comfortable, stylish and gets the MPG advertised. We commute 180 miles daily. Owned and commuted with a 2013 Accord that was very reliable but extremely uncomfortable. So far, our new Avalon has exceeded our expectations...

Love the comfort and surprisingly peppy engine (outside of eco mode). Controls are ok, certainly better than our Lexus hybrid with the mouse set-up. Nice and quiet; handles well for a luxury car. Nice design and lines; much more modern than all previous Avalons.

Have just 1,800
miles on the car, but don't ever approach 40 or 50 MPG as some reviewers have. I suggest you do the math, and not believe the car calculations.

Heated seats heat up quickly and hot; and I like the ease of the climate control system. Stereo is average.

After considering everything from Passat, to Accord to BMW I ended up with the Avalon Touring Hybrid. I really wanted to get the new Accord Hybrid. However, there were several issues for metrunk space is horrible, engine revs are hard to get used to, availability and only MSRP available right now. Plus it's a new system and who knows what reliability will be. 

Now, on to the Avalon HybridI love it so far. Interior is sharp, hybrid drivetrain is smooth, Toyota has been building hybrids for a long time now so I expect this to be very reliable. I do, however, see them making a switch to Lithium Ion technology in the near future. For now, we have the "tried and true" nickel metal hydride.

Here is a problem I never thought about before this car- how good is a near luxury vehicle if the computer runs crapware? I have had my esthetically pleasing and beautifully driving Avalon hybrid for less than a month and have had the nav system replaced, repaired and retuned twice. The Entune idea is a good one but I am convinced it is buggering up the on-board computer. Still not resolved but I am hopeful this can be fixed...

Purchased this car about three weeks ago and have 1000ish miles on it.
Have been averaging 39 mpg in mixed driving.
The car is very nice.
Rides well but a little stiff.
It definitely doesn't have the soft, "grandpa" ride of the older Avalons.
It is very comfortable and all the electronics seem easy to navigate.
Also considered the Fusion and MKZ hybrids as well as the diesel Passat.
Chose the Avalon for its combo of mileage, value, power and fit and finish.
Have received a lot of compliments on the look of the car.
Was also able to negotiate a deal well below TMV and invoice.
Very happy with this purchase so far.

Purchased our Avalon Touring Hybrid in May and was immediately very happy with the choice we had made.
Looked at the Ford Fusion Hybrid - nice car, but not as nice as the Avalon, whose interior is greatly superior to the Fusion.
Have driven 4,000 miles, a mix of highway and city, and am averaging 40.3 mpg.
You can't beat that.
Put everything together - styling, spacious and excellently appointed interior, plenty of cutting edge technical gadgets - and you have one outstanding package.
The fact that it runs on regular gas as another plus.
We considered a Lexus, but the Avalon was just too good to pass on.
It has to be one of the best cars Toyota has made, and it's made in America!

Got it in March 2013. Just hitting 10,000 miles. Found that I get better than sticker said for road. I have gotten from 39.1 for low and 46.9 for a high. City driving is another thing though. I have a low of 28.0 and a high of 44.2 in city only. 28.0 was in suburbs of Memphis, TN. I use a calculator as the computer always claims higher mileage except 2 times when it was low!

Car exceeded my expectations! Substantial vehicle for the money!

With a new business requiring 140 mile round trip 5 days a week, I had to get a vehicle with great gas milage.
I am a big guy and wanted something comfortable and able to haul people when needed.
Had my sights on the Camry Hybrid and test drove it.
Was ok but kind of blah sitting next to the Avalon.
Decided to try the Avalon Hybrid as well.
Comparably equipped the touring Avalon is about a 5k dollar upgrade but that is a great value!
Interior and exterior styling is a huge improvement over the Camry plus some great extra features like the side mirror monitoring that lets you know when car is in your blind spots on freeway or multi laned roads.

What an amazing car. My wife and I took our '11 Avalon in for service and drove out with the '13 Hybrid. We drove Prii and the Camry Hybrid and there was no comparison to the Avalon Hybrid. Smooth, quiet (quietest car I've driven at 70/75!), handles much more securely than the '11, lots of room, great job on the interior making it both inviting and sporty. We were concerned about the CVT trans and the power and boy were we proven wrong. Not as strong as the V6 but pretty darn close. Transition from gas engine to electric is seamless and no 'rubberband' feel like on many CVTs. . Visibility is excellent. Overall a superb upgrade to the previous model and an excellent upscale sedan!
