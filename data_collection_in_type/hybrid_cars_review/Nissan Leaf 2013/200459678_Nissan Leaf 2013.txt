I have owned my Leaf for about 3 yrs now and I still marvel at all the gas, oil, and maintenance dollars I have saved over the years.
I also own a Highlander hybrid and it's amazing how much just routine maintenance costs each year. The LEAF still looks new and has not had the first problem.
Of course, it would be nice if the range was over 70 miles, but as a 2nd car that is really all I need.
From a value standpoint this is one of my best buys.
My wife and granddaughters all fit fine in the front and back and it's a great car about town. I charge the Leaf about 95% in my garage and my electric bill is still in the same range as it always was - you would never know I charge a car daily.

I lease a 2012 Leaf. It comes with no spare tire, a real drag. It is not a winter car for those who have trouble driving in snow. It needs winter tires for the front, and I don't know how much that will help. Using heat,wipers,defrost, and driving in snow lessens the range by 30%. I commute 26 miles uphill
<1000 ft and I've used 80% of the power to do it in winter on bad days. I use a 120volt space heater to warm the car first. Better range (126 mi/charge)
2016. Ad now is misleading . 126/106 isn't the range, but the mpg equivalent- comparing it to a gas car. Don't be fooled. Solar roof is available only overseas,not in usa yet. Decent second car, my 1st, but I'm waiting to 2016 for next..

I sat on it for 6 months before i pulled the trigger.
My daily commute is 40 to 60 miles (one way) and I spend $600.00 a month on gas.

model:SL with 360 all around view with Bose sound system

I stopped by my health club (before or after work) to charge my car while I work out.

Travel takes more planning than driving ICE vehicles but eventually becomes systemic.

at times when I get low on battery capacity, i just move over to slower lane. i watch power meter like a hawk and rarely go over the 4th circle.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had my 2013 for about 3 months now.
I cannot imagine EVER driving an ICE car again.
Now, gas powered cars feel crude, rough and loud.
The Leaf is smooth and quiet.
I feel like I'm driving on air.
I love the fact that I am helping to decrease our dependence on foreign oil and that I am not contributing emissions to the environment.
(This car was second choice to my unaffordable fantasy car, a TESLA , but I truly couldn't be happier.)
Acceleration is not exactly going to wow you when getting up to highway speeds, but it's certainly enough to feel safe merging into highway traffic. I expected an electric car would be VERY sluggish and was pleasantly surprised from the test drive on!

We leased the 2013 SL in June and completely satisfied with the car at this point. They did a great job making it as much like driving a conventional car, which my wife likes. We spent ab out a year thinking about how it would fit our lifestyle and could not think of a single instance were we would be "stuck" without a gasoline motor. I charges quickly with the 240 volt charger. The dashboard technology is great and easy to interpret. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought my Leaf in the shadow of Nissan's North American HQ - at the Franklin,TN Nissan Dealer. Well just down the street from this dealer (who did a good job) is the Nissan HQ, which has a quick charger (20min).

I live pretty close to that charger, so this purchase is a no-brainer for me. I don't have to worry about range ever while I'm driving my normal route. As a result, the people who I pass get to see this Leaf go flying by at whatever speed. Its a quick, fun car, so it's a shame everyone doesn't live this close to a quick, free drink.

I only ask that there is an Infiniti version soon that looks a little more sophisticated.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As long as you use this car within its range limitations it is wonderful.
I am getting the EPA rated range without trouble (about 85 miles with 100% charge and 65 miles with 80% charge which is recommended to maximize battery life).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A lovely new advancement in the 2013. The 6.6 charger really make a big difference, I can charge my mostly empty car in 3hours. I love SL sylings, leather, Bose sound system, and intelligent door locks. A great ride. But little, if any, improvements in range
a real disappointment..Edmonds needs to test the 2013 range... And I volunteer my new leaf for the test.
