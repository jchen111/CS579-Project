Special-ordered this car to get all the tech available in a fuel-efficient mid-size sedan. Unfortunately, the car only delivers 37.6 mpg - not the claimed 47 (and I was able to get 52 mpg in a rented Hyundai, so my driving style is NOT the problem). Most disappointing is poor reliability - back in the shop for the 3rd time in 10 months for mysterious electrical issues. Poor workmanship from the factory allowed water to saturate electronic components, causing all sorts of electrical problems. With only 9k miles on it, car has now spent 11 days in the shop over the past 10 months: my 2010 Chrysler has only spent 2 days in the shop & my 2003 import only 5. I just want to drive it off a cliff!!

If you can get anything over 30 MPG in town you can not drive over 25 and need to coast to stops.
 
On the highway 35 MPG is what you get.

Back seat leg room not there, trunk small even considering battery pack.

Driver side window molding coming off so I am gluing it on.

Am I disappointed of course but everything above I can live with except the total deception
Ford has put out on the MPG one might expect.

I am a recent buyer, having had the car for just a few weeks. So far, absolutely nothing about this car disappoints. Mileage is over 40 in town driving, and comfort is amazing.
The seats are probably the most supportive in this category, and the handling is certainly the most crisp and confidence inspiring. Handles like nothing else in this class.

I ordered a Hybrid Titanium model.
I like driving the top of the line, but didn't want to go plug in.
This car is just amazing.
In town (small rural town) I am achieving over 50 on most trips.
Some of the shortest trips of less than 2 miles will vary from high 30's to low 50's.
Interstate is in the 40's and back road highways are returning just about EPA rating.

Ordered the car in October.
Finally delivered December 26.
The first night, half the dash panel did not light up.
Took it to the dealer - it was a "fuse".
Three days later, same half of the dash panel didn't light up again.
It came back on the next day.
Four days after that, the blind spot sensors stopped working and the warning light came on.
Took it to the dealer - they had to order the sensor.
It's on back order and is still not fixed.
Got the car back.
The next day, started the car and smoke filled the cabin as well as the smell of burning electrical wires.
Dealer - the wires going to the visor light shorted and burned.
Plus, got only 34.5 mpg.
Bottom line: DON'T BUY.
