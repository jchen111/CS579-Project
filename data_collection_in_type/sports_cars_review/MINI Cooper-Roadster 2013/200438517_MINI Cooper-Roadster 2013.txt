Wooow! What an amazing car to finally own and drive.
I ordered my 2013 Roadster S and got every option I wanted.
It only took about 6 weeks for Mini to build and deliver my baby, and for the past 3 months I have loved every second in the car.
Quick as all, handles extreamely well, TONS of fun options, and looks amazing.
I hear great comments everyday!
If you are looking for a fun car that moves with style this is your ride!
If you are looking for a smooth ride with tons of room it's not for you!
