Just purchased a new Mustang and already back for repairs. Needs New lower control arms and bushings. Noises coming from drive tran. Missing pieces that were left off.  Costly junk..I ll never buy Ford again.. Corporate office of Ford is rude and could care less if they made junk. Local dealer not much better.

I bought the '14 base model Mustang. 0$ in extra features, but I say base model loosely. Base model includes a very good sound system, HID headlights, LED tail lights, electronically selectable steering feel (sport, standard, and comfort), electric everything except for the seats, side air bags, and I'm sure a ton else I cant think of right now. Additionally, this is the most fun car I have ever owned. Despite the V-6 it has 305 horse power stock and rockets off the line. Handling is significantly better than I expected, freeway on/off ramps are so much fun in my Mustang! Out the door I paid $18,100 before tax and license, sticker was $23,500.

My last 'Stang was a '96 GT.
My V-6 is faster, and more fun to drive than that car was, though I loved it as well.
Acceleration is excellent.
More than enough to get me into or out of trouble.
I took it on a mountain road, and it cornered great great.
Always predictable. IRS will be nice, but I went fast enough to have some fun. I'm not Jeff Gordon.
If you're looking for a fun to drive dependable car with plenty of power, and allot of looks, and comments, you'll love this car!
Ya, the GT hauled, but I'm getting 29-33 MPG with my V-6.
How fast do I need to go?

Back seats are ok for 5'9, and under. Don't like Ford's Sync, but it was hardly a deal breaker.
I love this car!!

I haven't had a "fun" car in 30 years due to family & company car requirements.
My 2014 basic 6cyl manual is a totally fun "toy".
I use the Mustang for daily cummute & weekend erands.
The car gets an amazing 25.5MPG & the attention the Mustang gets at the gas station is surprising.
The 6 speed manual is more fun the longer you own the car.

One reviewer said he was looking at Ford because they didn't take government money. I admit that was a consideration for me. I went looking for a Fusion but found they were pricey. I will have to drive the mini van in the snow but that's a necessary compromise in the Midwest. I have 1500 miles on my Mustang now, I'm getting 23 mpg so far (the same as my 08 Grand Prix) and this car makes me smile every time I look at it. You can modify a 'stang but I think mine looks great as is. I'm glad I didn't get a boring car. Bucket List! PS-I do have the auto tran but that wasn't an option for the review. Cost-under 22K. I get the feeling you can get an even better deal if you bargain better than me.
