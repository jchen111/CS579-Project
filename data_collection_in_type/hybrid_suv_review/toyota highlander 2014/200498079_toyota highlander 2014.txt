I've had the car for 5 months so feel like I can give it a proper review.  I checked out all of the competitors and narrowed it down to the Acura MDX (basic model with AWD) and the Highlander Limited Platinum AWD.  They were close in price, but of course you get more bells and whistles with the Highlander Platinum trim vs MDX base.  

I actually preferred the ride of the Highlander due to it's steering feel in conjunction with a very smooth ride.  This car has plenty of power when you need it (unlike Pilot).  

You will enjoy the ride regardless of the trim, but if you can swing it, you will not be sorry with the Limited Platinum.

I got the Limited Platinum about 10 days ago.
All I can say is wow.
I love the sharper looking exterior except the front grille, but it is growing on me.
The interior is gorgeous and plush.
I finally got the almond leather interior after many years not having it and I love the contrast of colors.
It is a sharper driving vehicle than the 2011 Limited that I traded in.
Better feel of the road and handling.
The new 6 speed automatic is very encouraging so far as far as gas mileage.
Seems better than the 2011 and it is brand new with very little mileage so the mileage should actually get better after I drive it a few thousand miles!
 Puts a smile on my face even more than the 2011 did.

I have owned my new Highlander Limited with platinum package for a week and a half now, and I must say this SUV is totally different from my 2008 Highlander. From the upgraded luxury of materials inside, to the super quiet and smooth ride with the new 6 speed transmission, it is fun to drive. The steering is a favorite improvement..you can feel the road with precise handling and no sloppy feeling to the wheel. The seats are very comfortable, with plenty of room front and back. All of the tech features are great, and a big help. The multi info system is awesome, and it is right between the gauges .The JBL stereo is great, and I enjoy the big screen for Entune and navigation. So many apps!
