First off, this is our second 2014 Pathfinder.  We purchased a standard SL V-6 Model last year, and grew to love it so much, we traded in my eight year old Camry hybrid for a Hybrid model Pathfinder.  It retains all the comfort and smooth handling of its V-6 cousin, but adds in some very impressive MPG numbers to boot.  I'm only on my third tank of gas after owning it for two months, and Fuel Economy has improved with every tankful (27, 29, and now 31 MPG).  It's actually a bit quieter then it's V-6 cousin, due to the extra sound deadening material, and the transition from engine to EV mode is a lot less noticeable then it was in my old Camry hybrid.  Nissan gets an A+ for this model.
