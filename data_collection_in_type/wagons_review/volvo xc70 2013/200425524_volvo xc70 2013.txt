We've had our XC70 a year-plus. Had a V70 before it. We love it! Car has understated luxury. Feels like it's build like a frickin' tank, as I'm sure it is. Turbo engine does well. Not what you'd call nimble for around-town driving, but fantastic seats and big-car driving dynamics make it an awesome road-trip car. Excellent stereo.

Car looks classy, inside and out. 

We owned an SUV in the past -- and hated it. Hated the high, tippy feel, tight squeeze in parking spaces, bad mileage. The Volvo solved all that. We recently bought a 2014 Highlander for 7-seater carpool purposes, and while it's nice enough it's not as all-around great as the Volvo. Toyota's only advantage: 2 more seats.

Got this car to replace my 2006 Highlander.
What a difference.
Great power, comfort and quality.
Drove the car on a 4000 mile vacation and averaged 23.6MPG-much better than I had expected.
The comfort of the front seats is exceptional.
I like the understated design of the car.
Friends and family were surprised by my purchase but once they rode in the car they were bowled over.
I feel very secure in the car at high speeds.
