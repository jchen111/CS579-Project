We have about 4,000 miles on our 2013 Jetta Diesel Sportwagen.
Excellent car.
Fantastic value for the money.
The front seats are comfortable and supportive.
Adjustment is quick and easy.
This car can carry alot of stuff or people with ease.
Mileage has stayed around 45mpg.
With a cargo box on top I still managed over 42mpg.
The audio, bluetooth, CD, IPhone, memory card system is great!
Sound quality on our standard system is pretty good.
So far we are very happy.
