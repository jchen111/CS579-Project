Drove from Orlando to Philadelphia on just 2 fuel stops. average 41.8 MPG. 
Passed many a hybrid "conserving" fuel.
TDI gives plenty of pep for passing and having the "manual mode" helps when pulling hills or overtaking.
Fits our 3 person family just fine with even a large 2 seat Burly bike stroller in the back.

We chose this over an Outback due to fuel savings.
It also beat the Focus hatchback due to cargo capacity.
The Focus did not pass the stroller fit test.
Dash is simple to use ..controls on the steering wheel are easy to adjust to.
Blue tooth is exceptional...
 Have over 11 k in just 6 mo.
Couldn't be happier

I purchased my JSW TDI last October (2013 model) and now have 16,000 miles on it.
First diesel and first VW owned.
Build quality and reliability thus far has been impeccable.
Not a single rattle.
There is also a distinct solidness to everything...the sound of the doors when shut, the firmness of all switches/ buttons and so on.
Everything has the feel/ quality of a much higher priced European vehicle.
Room?
I cross-shopped against small to medium sized SUV's and other wagons (Subaru, Acura, Prius V) and the JSW offers more useable cargo space than any of the rivals, all while offering drive-ability and road feel not too far off from a sports car.
