The Prius V poses the following suggestion by Toyota: Reliability being the cardinal feature, you are going to have to make significant compromises, but still pay the big bucks for some kind of a vinyl interior and a paper thin shell, because it is a Toyota and the general consensus is a Prius will still get you there the vast majority of the time without hiccups and do so without the mandatory toll on the pocketbook from exorbitant gas prices. The vehicle gets a poor safety rating from the IIHS, so regardless of whatever merits the Prius V may or may not possess, you might still get there, but without legs or head intact.

So Prius v wagon or Jetta diesel wagon... though generally I much prefer Germanic driving dynamics, dollars and sense said same mileage with regular gas vs high cost of diesel fuel and likely lower maintenance costs. Thus the Prius. Handling was below par and crosswinds/truck buffeting was downright scary at times. Without going crazy, for less than $800 complete, a Cusco rear sway bar, Tanabe front and rear springs (10% +/- stiffer and less than an inch lower) with 7mm wheel spacers in front and 5 mm in the rear and the little golf cart that couldn't became the go cart that could! Stable at all speeds, cruising "sweet spot"
on secondary roads and highway rose 10 mph comfortably. Awesome!

Understand - I am a 56 year old man with a wife of 25 years and 2 grown kids.
I am not 'green'...not wasteful, but not 'green.' I don't haul kids, but I do haul 'stuff' sometimes!
I've yet to need to haul anything (Home Depot, etc.) that this Prius wouldn't haul.
I traded a beautiful, fully loaded 2012 Tacoma - 4 door, 4WD, TRD Sport Edition (17 MPG) - on this Prius.
Why?
Fuel economy, and I love gadgets.
This car is my "fun to drive gadget."
Yes, I called it "fun to drive."
Why?
Because I enjoy trying to squeeze the most fuel economy out of that I can, and I'm getting a 'real' 42 mpg - calculated manually (trip computer says 44-46 usually.)
And it's a Toyota - amazing quality.

I bought a Volvo XC60 in November 2012 to haul my kids and giant dog, but after 4 months of getting 15 mpg, I traded it in for a new Prius V. Instead of getting lousy gas mileage, I now get good gas mileage, but not as good as I expected. After 8 months, I average 33 mpg. Hubby says I book it off the line too quickly. I say it's the extra 125 pounds of dog that I'm transporting that he isn't. Either way, it's twice as fuel efficient as both my previous minivan and Volvo XC60, so it's a win. I won't lie: I miss the luxury of the Volvo. The seats were more comfortable, the doors were more solid. The Prius V doesn't feel cheap, but it's certainly not luxurious. At least it has built-in nav.

Our first Toyota was a 2nd gen. Prius. Got that one after an 03 Civic Hybrid that we gave to one of the kids. Then purchased a 2010 Prius 5 and gave 2nd gen to other kid. Now have 2013 V5 with ATP to go along with the 10. The 10 is superior to the 2nd gen, the 13 is superior to the 10. Mileage is running 44-47/mpg on eco. This is calculated, not by the gauge (which on the 13 has been very accurate). The ride is smooth, the steering is American but quite tolerable, after all it's a wagon. The radar assist on cruise is a useful feature. Space, including leg and headroom, is terrific. I am still amazed at the seamless transition between gas and electric motors. Adequate power. A remarkable car!

After driving a 2nd Gen. Prius for 6 years, I foolishly traded it in for a 2012 Kia Optima EX.
After 11 months I came to my senses and traded that in for a 2013 Prius v.
The v drives great, is comfortable and can haul a lot of cargo.
I can't speak for the other models, but the 5 has everything I would ever want.
They say MPG is 44 City and 40 Hwy, but I average 45-47 MPG per tank.
You need to drive it a bit differently than a traditional gas engine car, but once you learn the technique it is easy to outpace their estimates.
The sound system is fantastic and the bluetooth is crystal clear.
The moon roof is a great feature. This vehicle has it all.

Love it.
