After shifting into drive, the transmission waits a beat (about 1 long second) and then shifts.
When the car is in drive, the fuel delivery and/or timing surges periodically.
Both make for a jerky drive.

The gas pedal is VERY touchy.
The gas pedal must be pressed very lightly at first, so as not to give passengers whiplash on start-up from a stop.

For short drivers (5'-5'4")
the headrest can be uncomfortable.
Instead of a flat surface, it bulges out and tips forward, pushing the driver's head into a chin downward position.
It is not tilt adjustable.

Eyesight is helpful,
however, it once stopped the car on a highway when the car in front moved left to make a left turn.

I know that this model will be replaced this summer with a newer version, but I love it and needed a replacement for my previous Outback. The car has plenty of room, comfortable seats, and handles snow and other bad weather with ease. 
I chose the Eyesight feature and found it excellent. The newer version should be even better. It has the capability of stopping accidents, and controls your cruise control to ensure that you are following the vehicle ahead of you at a safe distance even when they slow down.
The car can carry most things a homeowner would want either on the roof rack, or in the back with the rear seats folding flat.

My first Subaru was a 2006 Outback 3.0R LL Bean model, and my second is the 2014 Outback Limited 2.5 with the CVT.
They are nothing alike, and and I like each of them for different reasons, but they do have one thing in common.
Both came out on top of after an exhaustive comparison of other brands.
Frankly, I prefer the 06 because it was a much more engaging car to drive.
However, the new model was more of a sensible purchase.
It's significantly larger and more flexible, gets much better mileage, and has more bells and whistles.
I heavily considered a Mazda CX-5, Subaru Forester, and also an Audi Q5 and Volvo XC70. I can afford the last two but it was hard to justify their prices.

Shopped around a lot, but was won over by the Outback's push-button park brake (wife has physical issues with pull-ups), its interior refinement, its reputation for reliability, its snow-handling prowess (BIG plus). Dealer couldn't have been happier to give a great trade in value and shave 2,500 off MSRP. It has SUV abilities, but drives like a car, and does not jiggle like a tall SUV. We are an empty nest couple in our 60s, who live on a farm in PA, and we need the perfect blend of on-road manners with the guts to get up and down a challenging driveway. It is a relief to find such a vehicle after fighting the SUV wars for decades. Should've done this years ago.

This vehicle fits my lifestyle right now.
We sometimes take long trips, and the interior comfort of this vehicle is excellent.
It is also handy for those occasional do-it-yourself projects that require a large hatch/trunk area.

Mostly, though, the vehicle (car/wagon/baby SUV?) is fun to drive.
I feel sorry when I have to turn the engine off.
I especially enjoy the EyeSight features, including adaptive cruise control.

This is my first Subaru and I hope to be able to gift the vehicle to my child at high school graduation in five years.
