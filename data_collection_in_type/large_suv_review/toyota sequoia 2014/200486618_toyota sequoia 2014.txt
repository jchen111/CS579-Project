Test drove the car back in 2008 and loved it.
Finally purchased one in Jul of 2014.
Steady and solid steering .
Excellent use of interior space. 3rd row seats fit adults. Powerful engine and fun to drive. Has a great instrument panel design, intuitive and functional. Simple fixes, like changing light bulbs can be done easily yourself.
Good visibility to all directions from inside.
I am not a car guy, but i love driving this beast.
I would recommend this to anybody.
The only change would be to make adjustable suspension a standard feature.
Else, this car rocks!
