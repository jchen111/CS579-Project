I've had my Ridgeline for about 18 months now.
I had one very minor warranty claim, which was handled promptly and courteously by the dealer.
This is a great vehicle for the suburbanite who needs to make the occasional Home Depot run, and may need to haul a smaller RV trailer.
I've hauled U-Haul's 6 x 12 trailer fully loaded with no trouble using the factory installed receiver.
 This is NOT for the manly man who needs a macho truck.
It's a great combination of comfort and flexible cargo capacity.
The trunk in the bed makes a great cooler for tailgating.
