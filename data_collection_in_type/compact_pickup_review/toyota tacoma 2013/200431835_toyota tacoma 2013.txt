I love this truck!! Legendary reliability and resale value is ridiculously high! I have a v6 tx edition pre runner double cab so it has a tough rugged look. Cant even count how many compliments Ive gotten on how badass the truck looks, I had a crewmax tundra and the taco is much easier to maneuver and more comfortable to drive daily, although the interior is smaller, my 2 kids and the wife fit comfortably. My only regret is not getting the 4x4 but I'm not much of an offroader. I mainly use the vehicle to drive to work , plenty of stop n go lights but gas mileage is decent and you don't notice the meter move unlike full size trucks.

I've been driving BMWs for quite a awhile but my wife and I entered the home renovation phase that required multiple trips to Lowes/HomeDepot and similar stores. The day I had to pay a guy with a truck $20 to assist me with delivering some drywall was the day I knew we needed a truck in our household.


Not a BMW but for a mid-size truck, comfortable and agile enough to move around town without mowing everyone down.
I purchased a special 'demo' version that contains almost every accessory available and it's a sharp looking vehicle. My wife, kids and even the dogs seem to enjoy it. I feel good that I don't have to worry tearing up $60K plus vehicles while renovating our home.

most uncomfortable truck i've ever owned. The 
driver's seat is so poorly designed I can hardly walk when I leave the truck after 30 minutes of driving. Miss my chevy silverado crew cab. 
The dealership was terrible, didn't even offer to
demonstrate the vehicle after the purchase. Just
handed me the keys and walked away. 
(Smithtown Toyota, NY). I had to go find the truck myself.

The truck is overpriced to begin with which explains the higher resale price. After driving 
full sized silverados with every option available
for almost the same price, I was amazed that so
few comfort and convenience options are available for these trucks i.e. power leather 
heated seats, climate control.
