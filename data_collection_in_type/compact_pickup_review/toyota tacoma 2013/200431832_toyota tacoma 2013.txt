After owning a troubled GM truck for a decade, I had high hopes for this truck. Unfortunately it seems that Toyota has dropped the ball.
Though a smaller engine than the 6 cylinder S-10 I owned, this 4 cylinder gets worse gas mileage. The ride is very choppy and the Dunlop installed tires seem very cheap.
Why not Michelin Toyota? The exterior of the truck is stylish and the seats on the prerunner are very comfortable, but what is the deal with that cheap Entunes crap stereo?
The sound is awful and the so called voice activation rarely works.
I do like the space in the access cab and the warranty offered was excellent, but Toyota could do better.

There are only a couple of choices for a mid-size pickup. The Tacoma is an average vehicle that could easily be much better.
All Tacoma's speedometers are off by 3 mph and all 4-cyl engines tick like toy engines.
The 4-cyl engines are less than adequate for a useful pickup truck.
The transmission has to downshift twice going up marginal grades at 65 mph. I want more mpg than the standard 1/2 Ton PU, but need enough power for adequate highway driving.
