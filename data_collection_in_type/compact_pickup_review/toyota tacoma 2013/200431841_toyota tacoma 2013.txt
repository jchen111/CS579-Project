Bought a TRD Off-Road version and have already put 25K miles on it.
The truck is very comfortable to drive, relatively quiet inside, and it is just the right size for my needs.
The JBL sound system is comparable to the upgraded sound systems on most luxury cars.
The V6 provides more than adequate power, but I'd love to see the Tundras 4.6 V8 as an option.
The BFG tires that come with the off-road strike a great balance between on road and off road driving.

Also despite the Edmunds review the brakes are not at all spongy, if anything they are grabby.

No Tacoma "Fan Boy" here. This is my first Toyota vehicle and there have been no surprises so far. The 2013 Tacoma has been what a truck this size should be. Powerful, quite, smooth at highway speeds. It does have a firm ride thanks to the TRD off road pkg. I am 6'1" and the cab had plenty of room in the front and rear seats. Parking this truck is no major chore with the short bed. I paid $500 below invoice or $30180 before TTL fees. Overall I am very happy with this truck.
