This is my company vehicle which I will put 50k miles on per year.
It's a comfortable place to be, I drive long distances, and the 3.7L V6 is powerful enough if you don't haul heavy stuff. I get 17-18 mpg overall, I know the EPA highway figure is 23, and I have never come close.
The steering, brakes, and ride are quite good.
It is a quiet cab which my sleeping baby boy likes.
It has a commanding view and no real blind spots.
Overall it is a very nice vehicle but if I were buying it for myself I would get the ecoboost V6.
I would recommend this truck to a friend.
