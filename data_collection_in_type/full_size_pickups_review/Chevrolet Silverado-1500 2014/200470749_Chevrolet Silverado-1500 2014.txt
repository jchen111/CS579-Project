I've had my 2014 Silverado for 9 months now and have had a long list of issues.Numerous recalls. Had an engine misfire at 14500 miles. Had to replace number 8 cylinder coil which had a history of misfires. Driver side door actuator went out and had to be replaced. The day after I got the truck back (less than 24 hours later) the front passenger side door actuator went out (currently at dealership writing review while its being fixed). When punching the gas the 1st to 2nd gear shift is very rough. Transmission guy at dealership said that's normal which I don't believe. Currently ongoing issue. Really hope GM reads this and contacts me. After what I spent on truck I shouldn't be having issues.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I traded in a 2004 Nissan Titan for the redesigned Silverado. I decided on this truck due to the redesign & the gas mileage. WRONG MOVE!!!
I have yet to get more than 17mpg & I have 20K miles on it. I do 97% highway driving. I've taken it to the dealership at least once a month complaining about it, no solution. I've contacted GM, no solution. Towing is terrible. I have a single axle 5X10 enclosed trailer & this Silverado was struggling!!
And the trailer was empty!
I got better mpg from my Titan with 190K miles & 2 cracked manifolds! As soon as Nissan upgrades the Titan I'm running back!! Got consistent 18-19mpg from the Titan since I bought it new in 2004
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where do I even begin?
This truck is a nightmare.
The only thing worse is GM's response or lack thereof.

1.Moving/shifting drivers seat; GM failed to fix it three times. 
2.Missing lights on radio; GM states they're not on this truck(LTZ) even though it clearly shows the lights in all the brochures and the Sierra has it.
3.Condensation in the headlights.
4.Fluctuating RPMs and rough idle; GM can't fix it.
5.Heated seats don't function properly.
6.Poor radio reception.
7.Rear power sliding window motor constantly breaking.
8.Thin spots on the paint.
9.Loose column shifter.

I will never purchase another GM product again.

Chevy is back on top of the light truck market.
The 2014 Silverado 1500 truly rocks.
While the sheet metal is only a tad different than the 2013, the interior is a quantum leap forward and the power plants truly advanced.
I have owned Ford, Dodge, and Toyota pickups, but never a Chevy.
Being back in the market, I drove them all.
The Chevy sold me first turn of the key.
I ended up with a highly optioned Crew Cab Z71 4WD LTZ.
The sticker was healthy, but well worth it.
It's a thrill every time I get behind the wheel.
I've heard the term "Cowboy Cadillac" before, now I know what it means.

Chevy's marketing agency needs to revive the old "Like a Rock" ads.
They fit this ride.
