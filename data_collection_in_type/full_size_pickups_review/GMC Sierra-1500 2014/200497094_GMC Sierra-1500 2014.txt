First off this review is for my 6.2L not the 5.3l.
I came from a 2013 GMC denali .
this new 2014 is by far better, Very Quiet, and this new 6.2L is a Real Rocket, I am getting yes AVE 17.8 with mostly City driving about 20 miles per day this is amazing compared to my 2013 denali which got Ave 14.8 City.
this 2014 I purchased is a mid year build (6/14) and Built in the Indiana plant, and they have done a great job during assembly, things fit well no noises or Rattles and no problems so far.
Turning radius is great, no Radio Reception problems  I am not sure yet about the headlamps, they seem to be fine, however I do not like the interior lighting, its all LED and no footwell lighting.

Well what can i say. I Fell in love with the way she looks. to those who have not put any real miles on there vehicles yet the problems only get worse. I never tow or haul anything i strictly drive freeway. no off road. Let me list a few problems i have. windshield leaks into the cab, windows are loud at freeway speed, rattling in the cab, headlights suck at night, suspension when wet creeks badly, truck chirps about 55 mph. Satellite gps quits randomly,usb ports stopped working,110 volt outlet quit, transmission slips, transmission searches for gears randomly shifts,Today 4/22/14 she lost power going up hill. i am in a love hate relationship with my truck these days.

I was so excited when the 2014 gmc came out. They where a nice change of appearance. Although once you buy one the story changes. The headlights are horrible, very difficult to see at night. The transmission has no clue what is should be doing, shifting when it should not be and not shifting when it should and makes loud noises. Absolutely no FM/AM radio reception, anywhere. I have not yet found a comfortable seat/head rest position. Now that i have this truck i do not look forward to driving it.

Got 2014 Sierra All Terrain in sept 13.
Healights are terrible to the point of dangerous. Far too dim. Had to install after market off-road lites. GM would not acknowledge problem.

4 wheel drive would not engage while stuck in snow high range. Engine would not accelerate.

Transmission clunks and shifts strangely. Seems to hang up between gears at low speed acceleration and slips.

Truck has already been recalled 3 times. Now it is leaking ant-freeze and will heed to go back to dealer.

It will be a Dodge Ram next time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bottom line, if you want to 'see' where you are going, don't buy this truck.
This is my third GMC, and it is becoming a bigger disappointment every day.
I have pictures to post if I could figure out how to do it..

ps... my ride is an SLE 5.3 double cab...
 that model is not listed in the choices above
