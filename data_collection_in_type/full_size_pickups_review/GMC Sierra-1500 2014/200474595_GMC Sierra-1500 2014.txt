As I stated in my earlier comment, I like this Truck!
However, the RUST on the frame rails, cross members, rear axle, body mount brackets (the whole chassis) is totally unacceptable!  I am beyond mad at the lack of Corrosion Protection Quality taken .  My 2014 Sierra frame has more RUST than the 15 year old GM pickup I traded in for this "new" Sierra.  The worst part is there is no way to fix this corrosion, other than the "silent TSB" band-aid @ the dealership!  Shame on you GM
