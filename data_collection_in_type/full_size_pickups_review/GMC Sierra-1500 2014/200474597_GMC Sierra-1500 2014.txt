This is a beautiful looking truck that everyone stops and stairs. The 50 thousand price tag for a truck that is already rusting at 25k miles and has had the radiator replaced at 11k miles, several recalls, etc. Not worth the money. Stick to the oldie but goodies. Again she is a looker till you look underneath. Don't do it and if you already did such as myself, get rid of it while you can!
