I have had this vehicle since August 2013 and have had absolutely no issues with it. I was somewhat surprised at some of the reviews in this thread as I have owned many Toyotas and have never experienced a problem they could not fix. I live in Arizona and we may have smoother roads than some of the cooler weather states, but I have found the Rav4 ride to be exceptional for this vehicle class. The features available on the Limited are outstanding, everything works perfectly and I love the versatility of the transmission.
Heck, you can treat it like a manual and in Sport mode that is fun.

I just bought a 2013 Rav4, the volume of the radio goes up, down and also sounds muffled at times. If you plug your ipod, it stays in loading mode with out playing. It will also go off or the screen goes blank in the heat. The volume jumping up is startling and my 7 y/o says " stop that mom". When I take it to the dealer service dept. this is a known issue and the fix is usually to replace the radio. They said they replaced the radio, it continues to do it. I have been there 4 times and they do not know how to fix. They should fix this before putting them on the market for sale. This is a defect. I have concern for the longevity of the car. I have lost trust in Toyota, will not buy another.

We purchased this vehicle in November and have found some things we like & don't like. We really like the blind spot monitor. This feature should be available on more cars. We also like the style of the car and rear cross traffic alert. We are extremely disappointed in the Rough, Bumpy Ride. It is a great riding car on the PA turnpike or a smoothly paved road. Our limited model has 18 inch Bridgestone tires and it provides a very Rough Ride. My voice even vibrates when I'm trying to talk to anyone in the car at the time with me. Don't think this will be a vehicle my husband and I will grow old with in our senior years.

We bought the car in mid-August. We really like the Blind Spot Monitor option. Also, an unexpected but convenient feature is that the music files on a USB drive can be played back directly. We also like the memory function of the driverÂs seat. Our main complaint is that the ride is really bumpy, even bumpier than my 20-year-old Corolla. Another thing is that the air outlets have begun to make an abnormal sound when switching the air flow from the setting of upper body and feet to the setting of upper body. Since the car has less than 2000 miles on it and it already got a problem, I really question the long term reliability of this vehicle.

We've had the Toyota RAV 4 Limited AWD since May 2013. Going from a Honda Pilot to this car took some getting used to. We haven't owned anything other than Honda's since 1987. We test drove Honda's, Hyundai's, Mazda's and we settled on the new RAV 4 as being the most practical vehicle for the money. We didn't spring for the extra $1100 for navigation. Our phones can get us where we need to go for no extra charge.

All in all, we like the car and would recommend it

I used Edmunds (among other sites for comparison) to help me do research for a new car, before I went out and test drove them. I dislike going to car dealerships, but I can say with confidence that I have improved with how to deal with them. Plus I had done my own research beforehand, and knew what to look at and expect (as well as knowing when a dealer was lying to me). Well here is my review of this lovely car after having it for about 4 months now, and some improvements that I think should be made for the future.

Bought my 2013 limited the end of June. This is a great car in so many ways. I know it will be reliable and I am already seeing the savings from my 04 explorer. 28mpg combined and 32 hwy. The power memory seats are great as is the auto liftgate. I would not have bought this car if it still had the sideways gate. 
The stereo is not great. actually it is bad. Too much sound up front and it is very bright and "scratchy" I have played with the controls endlessly. This is annoying as I love to listen to all kinds of music as I drive.

Had tro decide between a Subaru, Honda CRV or the Toyota.
 Picked the RV4.
had some problems with the Navigation.
Couldnt see the darn screen
dealer couldnt fix so I asked if I could
talk with
factory Field Rep who was coming to visit the dealer. Field Rep came &
said he doesnt speak with customers.
He also could not fix screen.
 So, what do Ido? I called the factory service complaint phone number and i couldnt believe it.
Said they only talk service with their dealers.
 Finally got an email from same department that said I couldnt complain abou ta problem if I didnt even know which engine I had!!
 I was stupid. Again, attacking me.
.
Why argue with me? Forget theToyota

I had a 2009 Toyota Rav4 which I really liked... I am one of the few that like the rear swing open door... my wife takes our two golden retrievers with her to work and it was very easy to get the old guy (13 years old, blind, deaf
but still loving life) into and out of the back with the wide door and low floor... 

to jump right to it.... I love the 2013 which I bought in the U.S. (yes I am Canadian, and the Rav4 is made 20 minutes from where I live but I saved almost $7,000 in the U.S.)

my concern is the exterior black plastics... when they get dirty and you wash them and then the car dries off, the dirt marks still show !!! has anyone else experienced this? please let me know. thx

my ratings for the vehicle are based heavily on what I believe to be inferior seats for the extra money that is paid for the limited.
there is a big price jump from the ex-l to limited and they try to justify some of it with the softex seats.
if you are want good quality leather seats, these will fall way short.
when you are doing test drives, pay particular attention to how the seat feels.
compare it to the leather seats in the Honda crv or mazda cx-5.
you will feel the difference.
if seat comfort is not that important to you and you don't mind spending the extra $3000 for limited, then you can disregard this review.
