I have owned the RAV for about one year. I bought it based on previous experience with Toyota vehicles and a good trade-in offer I got from my dealer for my previous car - my net-out-of-pocket on the RAV was ~$2-3k less than other comparable CUVs.

After one year of ownership the best I can rate this car is "average". The only real positive is the amount of cargo and passenger space. In every other area the car falls short, especially comparing to competition. It's noisy, has a very stiff and uncomfortable suspension, safety ratings are mediocre (below key competitors), transmission behavior is strange and disconcerting, mileage is OK but not outstanding. Bottom line - just average.

Overall a very good SUV. It's a Toyota, so their quality is good.

I found the transmission very responsive depending on the mode you select. Its 6 cylinder will of course shift gears more often than say a 4 cylinder. But we also enjoy 27-29 mpg in mixed city/hwy driving.

Overall this car is very nice.
I was previously an owner of a 2006 Honda CRV.
When I compared the two in the 2013 models the Rav4 won out.
However, after owing the car for a couple weeks I have some issues that I don't like about the design. First the low beam headlights are horrible.
They are the worst of any car I have ever driven.
There is a line across the lights that makes it so when I am driving I can't see very far up the road.
It is fine with the high beams but you can't run those all of the time. I hate the rear pass' windows.
They are small and they slope up toward the back blocking visibility making a blind spot.
The rear window does not open so you can't haul anything.
