You get a super nice car for around $30,000, if you go with the premium package like we did.
We got the saddle brown leather interior, which smells and feels wonderful, and is very luxurious.
We put a child seat in the back, and in doing that, you have to move the front seat up, which makes for a less than comfy ride...and I'm only 5'7"!


The gadgets are well placed, and the ride is very quiet and comfortable.
The car looks very elegant inside and out, and has every option you could ever want.

Performance on this vehicle sucks, straight up.
It is probably one of the weaker vehicles I have ever driven, and takes about 10 seconds to get to 60 mph.

I've had my Encore for 2 months now.
 I've been using it for my daily commute of 70 miles round trip...and am getting an average of 27.2 mpg.
 Just got back from a 10 day 10 state trip driving through torrential rain (tropical storm Andrea) and the only complaints I have is the Bluetooth wouldn't always connect with my phone and sometimes the GPS wouldn't work.
It was a little bit hard to pass other cars in the mountains of Pennsylvania but every other part of the trip the driving was great!
 We averaged 33 mpg.
 Plenty of room for 2 people and with the back seats folded down there was plenty of cargo space.

Based on first impressions, the new Encore offers a nice comfortable super-quiet ride.
It is is easy to maneuver in traffic and it has a lot of good features.
During the test drive, I could get it to merge on the highway without any problems--of course, I did not expect it to glide (say the way an Infinity does). I bought it because of its fuel economy, but it is still fun to drive. It took no time to connect my blue-tooth phone and have music come out beautifully from the Bose speakers. Don't let all the knobs discourage you--the system is actually easy to use! Having moved from an Acura TSX, I like the slightly higher ride while still having a compact size.

Vehicle road tested wonderful during the dealer visit, but has been a huge disappointment after taking it home. We already exchanged the vehicle (so we're on our second one) and really appreciate the dealership's cooperation with doing their best to make the situation right for us. Both vehicles have the same problem, in fact the 2nd one is worse and I wish I had kept the 1st one. 
 
While entering and exiting our driveway (with the steering turned left or right) which has a normal drainage dip (water canal) between the road and driveway elevation, there are thumping noises coming from the suspension. Of course as is typical...the problem could not be duplicated at the dealership. 
 
I have driven many many cars on my driveway and never heard this type of noise from any other car. I owned 4 GM cars over a 20 year period through 2009, and finally gave up due to the consistent need to pour money into repairs after about 4 - 5 years of ownership. 
 
I thought things may have improved and gave it another shot, but I guess I was dead wrong. I feel terribly let down and like I made a huge mistake. The classic definition of 'insanity' is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. I must be insane for falling for the same mistake over and over.
