After driving 13800 miles, in trips of 1400 to1600 miles per trip, since I purchased this SUV I can honestly say it needs more horse power for the road. Going up hills, and going into headwinds puts a definite strain on this little engine. And the more it strains the less MPG it gets.

I also am concerned with the air intake design beings this car stalled out on me while driving one crappy winter day in ND. This is not a good situation for a new car to have happen to it and the passengers. Snow/moisture should not get into parts of the engine compartment where it can cause problems.

This is one small compact crossover.
We looked at all of them and I mean all!
None of them made us feel the way this little baby Buick did.
Its classy, sharp, upscale and cut all in one.
True its not going to win a race but it is not mean to nor was it made for that.
It has plenty of punch.
We only have 385 miles on it and are getting 27 in the city, not bad for an AWD that take regular.
Give this vehicle a chance.
Buick has touched upon an important market and we are glad they did.

I have owned my Encore for 2 weeks now.

I love it!! 
I came out of a 10 year old Suv with no features of the 21st century.
I have already experienced a snow day commute and the Encore out performed most vehicles on the road that day.

I enjoy the features of the car and I have only had to visit the gas station once a week verses 2 to 3 times a week.

It has enough get up and go to get me where I need to be.
The car has enough power to get me up a mountain in the high country of Colorado without impeding other vehicles.

I am very satisfied with my new Encore.
