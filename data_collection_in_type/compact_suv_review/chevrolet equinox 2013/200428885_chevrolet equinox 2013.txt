6 months and 4,000 miles later I have absolutely no regrets! Comfy and fun to drive. No problem passing or merging.
Pleasantly surprised at the power it has when you need it.
Filling up was difficult but after a couple times you get used to it and now it's no problem. It's soo quiet , roomy and the ride is great.
My top 3 were the Mazda CX5, Nissan Rogue, and Equinox. After test drives I knew it was the Chevy.
I don't have any blind spots. It has a sturdy & safe feel. My mpg is as advertised but it's all in how you drive. A quick 500 mile trip gave me 31.8mpg.
I found a great dealer and got a great price! One problem is my daughter borrowed it and didn't want to give it back!

Special thanks to Jerry Massa at AutoNation Northpoint Alpharetta, GA. He worked with us and got us a great deal on our 2013 Equinox, and he treated us like royalty every step of the way.
This is a very well done suv, our second Equinox. Even quieter and smoother than the other one. We tested two other suv's, and this one beats them all.

I purchased this equinox after owning the same car from 2010.
Both are 4 cylinder AWD models.
I have seen some posts involving engine issues but both my 2010 (50K miles) and my 2013 (12K miles) are both great cars.
I get about 29 MPG on both combined driving and neither car is experiencing any engine issues or any other issues at all.
My wife is a very aggressive driver and her 2010 still is running original brakes and tires.
She never gets 50K on any of her vehicles so this has really impressed me about the car.
I have the oil changed by the dealer when the OLM reaches between 30-40% which is still around 6K to 7K intervals.
Just had both OLM upgrades and will post the new intervals

Wow, big screen display for camera.Finally, my wife has a car w/a camera.
Hah!
 The camera is too dark to see when backing from a garage and then, apparently, it adjusts to the light and is better.
 Hmmmm?
 By then I guess you could run over 3 tricycles and a shovel. Likewise, at night, the camera is virtually useless.
There is insufficient light from backup lights to illuminate the area you need to see. This thing should be recalled and fixed. NOW!
Conversely, my Kia Soul camera works very well in all the same situations.
So much for Yankee ingenuity and the $Billion bailout (oh yeah, my 2013 Equinox was made in Canada).Secondly, the luggage space is laughable compared to our RAV4s.

very poor rear visibility, wish I had known!

I purchased this vehicle for my family as a family Christmas gift. We immediately have fallen in love with this vehicle. The bells and whistles it offers are hands down top of the line and other similar vehicles do not offer them as a standard feature. This car drives and feels very safe with all the safety features it has on it. Six air bags, all disc brakes, On Star, Rear backup camera. 
This is a very comfortable ride. The front seats fit like a glove and there is so much rear leg room and space for people to stretch on long road trips. My wife rides in the back often because she likes the overall comfort while my son and I ride up front. The My Link system is stae of the art as well. A+

Love my new Equinox overall.
Very stylish, roomy and lots of fun features.
The back up camera is a plus and added with OnStar I have a reliable, comfortable driving experience.
There are two things I do not like about the vehicle...one is driving on wet or snow covered roads.
I elected not to pay the extra for the AWD and am kicking myself for it.
I figured for the amount of time I spend on bad roads I really didn't need the AWD.
Well, even on the city roads when the least bit wet or a dusting of snow and I feel like there is no control to the vehicle at all!
And secondly, the blind spots are real bad.
