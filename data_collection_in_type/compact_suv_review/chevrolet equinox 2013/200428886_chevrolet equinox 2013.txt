My gf bought a 2013 Equinox just over 1 year ago & we have enjoyed it as our daily commuter. We enjoy the cargo space as we have filled it up, probably too much, several times over the past year with room to spare. The Chevy MyLink system is good & bluetooth calling & entertainment system works well. My gf's favorite feature are the heated seats. They get very warm very quickly which she enjoys for her back. Driving is not very exciting due to lack of steering feel & you can feel the base 182 hp's lack of power in some situations, though it always gets the job done. We are always comfortable & you have lots of personal space which is great, especially for those trips with several passengers.

Bought the 2013 Equinox 2LT this past April.
Nice car.
First time to buy a Chevy after having Hondas and Toyotas for the past 20 years.
Couldn't beat the options and the price when compared to the Hondas and Toyotas.
Had some difficulty trying to find the exact car as there are so many options that are not necessarily automatic on a 2LT.
For example found the color we wanted with the leather seats we liked but it had a manuel rear door.
You would think that on a 2LT the power rear door would be automatically included.
Back seats are roomy enough for our 3 teenagers.
Front seats provide many adjustments for a comfortable ride.

I have 2000 miles on my 2013 Equinox 2LT, and have to say the car is great.
Very quiet, the handling and ride are great.
I am getting overall mpg of 28 and on the highway over 30mpg.
I wish I had gotten the LTZ but I am very happy with this car and cannot find any faults with the exception of my phone book linking up with the my link feature.
I called the toll free number and got a really helpful guy to set it up and worked fine but again is not linking up so have to call again.
But overall a great vehicle.

We bought our 2013 2LT 2 months ago and just love it! We have 2000 miles on it now and have recorded a best of 33.9 miles/gallon on our second road trip. I like the "eco" mode as it really helps get better mileage. I have also towed our small utility trailer to pick up some gardening items and a tree to plant and was very surprised at how easily it pulled the trailer.

We initially loved our Equinox, until the breakdowns and dangerous acceleration problems. The engine repairs began at 4500 miles or so, the transmission was repaired at 15,000 miles or so. With 30,000 miles, my wife doesn't feel it is reliable, so she drives the 2007 Mazda. The GM approach to satisfaction? Sorry!

Stylish and comfortable with bells and whistles that I love such as the turn by turn navigation, the Eco button which saves on gas and the way gas prices are today, I'm glad I have it and takes regular gas...which is a plus, it has the pioneer premium sound system....hands,-free calling, rear-view camera....[non-permissible content removed]
