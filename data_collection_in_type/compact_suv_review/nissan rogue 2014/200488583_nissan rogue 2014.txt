There are a few things I would change about my car, like the light colored head liner, and maybe tint the windows but that's about it. The AC does take a a few minutes to cool the interior, but that's with any car in 100+ degree weather. My average fuel mileage is 27.5. Once I passed about 3,000 miles I started seeing an increase in my gas mileage. I am very rarely getting less that 29 mpg and that's in the city! I looked at every other option for a compact SUV and I really think I made the best decision. The rear AC vents are my favorite feature! My kids were actually complaining the other day about being cold and it was 98 degrees outside the car! Lifetime Chevy owner, turned Nissan Lover!

I refrained from writing a review on my Rogue as I've only had it 4 months but having read the previous reviewers gripe with the A/C, I decided to add my two cents.
I live in Virginia and although this has been a mild summer in terms of heat, the A/C in my Rogue takes about 15 minutes to cool the cabin to a comfortable temperature.
I took the car to the dealership and had them investigate.
They said the A/C was cooling to 40 degrees as it was supposed to and by the service writer's own admission, on a really hot day, it could take 20 minutes for the cabin to cool.
In addition, I can't dial back the blower speed because the cabin never gets that cold.

I have opened a case with Nissan of No. America, due to the fact that I drove away from dealership with new 2014 Rogue, and was getting 15 MPG. They told me to wait till car reaches 1,000 for accurate gas mileage. Now at 2,000 miles and I am averaging 23 mpg. Not what they are advertising. I am NOT getting anywhere near 30, 32, 33 mpg highway, no way. Sucks and I am not a happy camper.
