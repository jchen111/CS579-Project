Did a lot of research and picked the Rogue in Midnight Jade. Surprised every 3rd car on the road isnt 1. Ive found 4 distinct driving modes. The put it in drive and go mode, the Low mode- for slow, bad conditions driving, sport mode-yahoo. when I get it broke in Ill b using almost exclusively. Last is turning off the OD or over-drive. Great for going up hills. I dont have to worry about mph, live close to work, so when the motor is broke in...sport mode! The active trace- inside wheels brake slightly is nice. But the birdseye-view camera is awesome, better than I thought. I feel if I didnt get a lemon, ill be raving about this car for years.

Bought AWD SL 2014 Rogue in Apr 14.
Only 4800 mils on it but
havebeen to dealer two times due to auto AC problems.
Dealer replaced seal on one visit but AC still not efficient.
Seems to take forever to switch from recirc air to outside air in a relatively mild climate (Maryland).
Dealer said AC working properly during last visit - if that's the case then AC is poorly sized for this vehicle.
Had several other vehicles witn Auto AC and never had this problem - it was basically set-and-forget.
Latest problem is cool air comes out of driver side vents but warm outside air out of passenger side with both sides set at 72 deg.
Going back to dealer again.

I just purchased a new Rogue and the car performed very well on a long road trip.
Highway comfort is excellent, with only a bit of road noise on rough highways.
The 2.5L powerplant has enough power and the trade off for fuel economy is one I'm happy to make. The CVT is fine, but I'm used to one.
Highway mileage hovered around 30 mpg w/ my overall economy only slightly lower at 27.5.
The car seems to be a great value.
We looked at all the competitors in the segment (and some outside it) and the Rogue SL interior was, by far, the nicest.
Suspension is very good.
Bose stereo also very good.
A very nice car all around.
Definitely worth a look if you shop this segment.

Purchased a New 2014 Nissan Rogue Fully Loaded with all options AWD, but after 1 week Paint is now coming off the front bumper.
Contacted Nissan Immediately only to get transferred to someone who will do nothing and stated that it must be bird [non-permissible content removed]
and will not cover the quality of a Nissan product purchased after 7 days.

I am SO happy with my new '14 Rogue SL AWD and am totally in love with it!
Nissan did a REALLY good job in this new redesign.
I was a happy owner of a '11 Rogue SL AWD, but once I saw how nice this new baby was, I traded up!
What an upgrade!
This new Rogue not only looks better inside AND out, but it's better in EVERY way compared to the old one.
It's good looking, comfortable, fuel efficient and SO nice to drive.
My favorite feature is the supremely high build quality and luxurious feel of the car, in general.
It feels like I'm driving a $40K car.
And, I'm getting compliments on it EVERY where I drive.
Do yourself a favor and sit in and test drive this car.
You WILL be impressed!

We have had this car only 2 months now and have already had an issue with it. The navigation/entertainment system stopped working for about 24 hours. It happened when I went to move the car off the street and into the garage. I noticed it start and then turn off when I shifted into reverse. Then it would not turn on no matter what buttons were pressed. A day later it started working again. My guess is that I shifted into reverse too quickly as the system appears to need time to boot up or maybe it was because I did not fasten my seat belt. Whatever the cause was, we haven't noticed any issues with it since. I saw a couple of other posts about this before, but now they are gone? Anyone else?

I purchased the 2014 Rogue SL AWD
The interior lay out is quit well I love the soft touch materials around the cabin also the seats are very comfortable both front and rear.
The Infotainment works OK, but
While navigating through the menus I see a lag within the response. The power lift gate is convenient.
The EPA estimate for the Rogue AWD is 25 city/32 highway averaging 28 MPG. My best
MPG is 34.8 Worst MPG 24.3, to attain the 34.8 MPG I have to drive the speed limit, but I think it's worth it.
the O/D button works well when passing 18 wheeler's or zipping through traffic.
Overall I am happy with my investment & advise anybody who is shopping for a SUV to test drive the Rogue.

I love my new Rogue!
It drives so quiet and smooth compared to the Honda I had!
I am hearing a lot of concerns about the Rogue not living up to the MPG.


With any vehicle the MPG are based on a standard way of driving the vehicle.
If you hit the highway and put your gas pedal to the floor and drive 75-80 every where you go, yes, you will be lucky to get 24-25 mpg- its a 4 cyl. engine that you are making work overtime.

I believe the standards used for all vehicles for highway testing is 60-65 mph.
With normal acceleration- no noise! 

I have been averaging about 30 mpg on the highway when doing the speed limit.

Traded 2010 Tucson Limited, what an upgrade!

 RAV 4 too much black plastic on ext. Weird door panel design on interior and felt smaller. Ford Escapeescape looks like a Tucson and Ford Touch not easy to use, I have it in my Mustang. Mazda C5 just too small, lacks refinement. Rogue just has a very classy look and it seems larger.

Rogues Lexus like interior
really well done, tasteful and comfortable. Most Knobs & dials within easy reach. Apps,sound system, blue tooth, touch screen very easy operation. Raised rear seats
nice touch, rear passengers can see where we are headed.

I rated reliability avg. because it is new. Fun to drive? Not a sports car, but a refined, comfy ride.

My lease was about up on my 2011 Mazda CX-9, which I loved. I decided to look at the Rogue since I loved the redesign. After test driving it I decided it was WELL worth getting a car that was a little smaller than the CX-9. The CVT has some noise but, honestly, it is the same as most engines revving up a hill or speeding up. It drive SOO smoothly. I got the Premium Package on the SL and it has EVERYTHING! The interior is beautiful, the touch screen is big and beautiful, the seats are SOO comfortable, and this car handles so amazingly well, as well as or better than my CX-9 did! I am getting about 23 mpg, but I only have about 400 miles on the car and I mainly drive city. Awesome car!
