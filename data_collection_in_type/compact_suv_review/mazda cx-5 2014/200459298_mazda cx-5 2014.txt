Review of our car after 6 months of ownership.


Our 2014 CX5 GS AWD continues to be a good vehicle and everything continues to be pretty much as expected.
The gas mileage continues to be low 20's around town and high 20's on the highway.
The engine performance is still mediocre at best - Mazda really needs to work on this...


Lack of interior lighting in the rear is a real miss.

Bose Audio system is very nice!

Have had an ongoing issue with the tire pressure sensor telling us air is low when it's w/in 1 lb of standard.
Apparently it is very sensitive - too much so!

See likes/dislikes below for various features.

Over-all, still a good choice!

Have own our 2014 AWD GT for 3000 miles.
Very happy with the car.
Wanted to write a review cause it was the many reviews on Edmunds that eventually helped me select
the CX-5 over the Forester.
CX-5 (in my opinion) just handles better.
Tracks real well, very stable.
Soaks up more bumps and noise better than the Forester.
Brakes well, handled very well in snow and rain.

Forester - can't beat the wonderful and huge sunroof, visibility MUCH better - CX-5 needs more attention.
Better heated seats on the Forester.
Bottom line - Mazda offered better trade, finance, car better handling.
Couldn't pass up - just more bang for the buck.

I bought this car because I was looking for a balance of performance and efficiency, as well as decent cargo space. I feel Mazda has delivered for me. I have a 6 year old and a 2 year old--they're both in full size car seats that fit fine. Cargo space appears sufficient after three months of use. The car is really fun to drive, and handled this bad NJ snowy winter very, very well.
That said, I also love a good audio system, and this one in the CX-5 is a colossal disappointment.

I purchased a 2014 GT/AWD 2.5 CX-5 in October 2013. I test drove Audi, Lexus, BMW and Infinity models of compact SUVs (with the intent to buy a luxury SUV), but this vehicle was the best bang for the buck overall. 

This vehicle felt comparable in handling and "fun to drive" with the Audi Q5. The size is great for (downtown) city driving (as about 90% of my driving is). I am getting great gas mileage, around 23-24 mpg city. It handles well in the snow, and feel like I have good traction when the road condition is less than perfect. I feel that it has good power to make it up the CO mountain roads.

The trim level is good with just a few things needing improvement for the GT trim level.

An update to the review written only a few days after buying...
We've now put 2500 miles on our '14 CX5 AWD and it's performing well.
Nothing failing, no problems - performing about as expected.
Gas mileage not quite what we hoped but still reasonable at around 25 mpg combined.
Closer to 30 on the open road but never higher average than that.


Finding a few shortcoming described below, but so far a good choice in a new vehicle.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I ought a 2015 CX-5 Grand Touring AWD with the technology package. It's been a great comfortable car, but the tech package is worthless and there are lots of issues with it. Google "Mazda CX-5petition" for details. The TomTom GPS would have been great about 6-7 years ago. Including it on a 2015 vehicle should be an embarrassment to both TomTom and Mazda. The system doesn't sync properly with iTunes, always playing the first song when starting. Bluetooth has issues.

My wife previously owned a 2010 3 hatchback.
We loved that car.
I loved that car even though I am 5'10", and 220 pounds, I fit comfortably in that car.
But my wife wanted something bigger, and when the CX-5 came out it was the perfect choice for her.
I like the CX-5, but wonder where the memory seats went?
Mazda please explain the silly logic of eliminating memory seats???
The 2013 3 had them.
My wife being 5'4", and me being 5'10", you can understand my dilemma.
My wife's GT has everything, rain-sensing wipers, rear camera, Smart-Assist Braking, Bose, navigation, but no memory seats!!!!
Not an option on the CX-5.
It is her car, but I picked the color: Solar Red.
Gas mileage so-so
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I did my research for a new SUV/CUV purchase, compared all the manufactures out there. Price was important, but so was power and features of the cars. My choice was clear after I test drove the CX-5, had the power I needed for every day traffic, comfort, handling (This thing handles like its on rails) and the tech included. Bose sound is fabulous, I wouldnt go without if considering this car. Gas mileage was best in class for an AWD CUV with the HP offered. Sure, the 260 HP Turbo offerings from other manufactures sure sounded nice, but the MPG suffered drastically and so did the sticker price. In my opinion, you cant get a better car in this class for the price,not with all the CX-5 offers

Traded in a '11 Ford Escape Limited AWD for the '14 Mazda CX-5 GT in Sep, 2013 so this is after 4 mo of use. Overall, a good vehicle. Pickup is good, comparable to the V6in the Escape. Mileage is better, though not as good as some on here indicate. In town averaging 23-24 mpg. However, in winter cold, mileage has dropped to 20-21 mpg. Use of remote start in bitter cold for 10 minutes, mileage drops to 18-19. Sound system is good, but not as good as the system in the '11 Escape. Some on here have complained about the Bluetooth connection. I have been using Pandora and the system works fine. Unlike satellite radio (ie Sirius), Pandora is coming through your cellphone first, then to the onboard

Bought this very recently and thus far, we're very happy.
We'll update this review after a few months with new findings and experience...

Contrary to a few reports, there is little road noise, the Bose system works great, Nav is just fine and the seats are very comfortable.
This is NOT a European luxury vehicle - at the CX5 price point, just add another $25K if you're determined to have true luxury.
Otherwise, after seeing virtually every other C-SUV, this Mazda competes quite well with all of it's competitors and in general, it does it for less!

Well worth looking at !!!
