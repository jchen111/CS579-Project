terrrible mileage  i have 2.0 turbo sportage. i only have 600km on it but the fuel consumption is huge, around 13 Liters per 100 km (around 18mpg). It says on the manual that there is a break in period of 5000 km, but i have big doubts that the fuel economy will improve. not sure if i recommend this car to anyone
