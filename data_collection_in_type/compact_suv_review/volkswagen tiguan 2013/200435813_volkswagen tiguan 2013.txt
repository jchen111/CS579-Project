Lots of power,Drives positive like a sports car,went on a trip using premium fuel 31mpg hiway Chilliwack Volkswagon(keith) gave me a great deal and there are quite a few other Tiguans around now so I assume others have had a great deal also! I talked to someone complaining about lugging but it is supposed to keep it in the highest gear possible to keep the RPM's down to save fuel (it is doing what it is supposed to do lol!)
