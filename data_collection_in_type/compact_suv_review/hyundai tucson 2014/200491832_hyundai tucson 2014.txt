We are in our late 60's and wanted a small suv.  Mileage is nowhere close to what is advertised about 21MPG.  It is underpowered to the point of being dangerous.  If you are driving in any kind of wind, HANG ON TO THE WHEEL!  Maybe after someone is killed in one of these Hyundai might listen.  This is the worst car I have ever owned and I have owned plenty in my lifetime
