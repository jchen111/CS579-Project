With me medically retiring from the military and getting a service dog, it was time to retire our Suzuki SX4 for something bigger, and with us moving to Maine it had to have AWD.
We had looked at Subaru's but the Ford dealer was able to give us a substantial discount to make this less than a Subaru, so we bit.
Wonderful little SUV, love the way that the AWD starts out in AWD and shifts to FWD as you are cruising.
Fuel econ has been great, and the kids are comfortable in the rear, with the dog in the back it fit's us perfectly. Going to have to do a few trips to get her to 1k miles before we move to tow a trailer, but that should not be an issue with how nice she drives. Will do an update.

I bought the Escape new on Black Friday and after 5300 miles and several trips back to the dealer....The dealer agreed to pay me back the entire purchase price on this very challanged vehicle. (1) the heat doesnt work very well, (2) the breaks squeal, (3) the interior rattles. 
I owned a new 2010 and that was a VERY good vehicle 70K miles and only 2 trips to the dealer for recalls/TSBs.

The dash lights are suppose to automatically dim with the ambient amount of light.
Mine don't and I have had it in the shop several times but to no avail.
A Ford Representative said in essense, "that is tough and just live with it".
There is no advisory on it yet and so they do not have a fix.
I was told they don't plan to make one.
Maybe on next year's model they will.
But according to Ford technicians, this one is designed to do just this.
 It is a sad fact that Ford will build such complex cars but are unable or unwilling to correct them.
Other threads I have read on the internet are experiencing this same problem.

Ford never fixed the 1.6L engine problems.
My car is always in the shop.

Just bought this vehicle and so far I Love it, downsized from a 2012 F150 Supercrew with the Eco-Boost engine and was wondering about feeling cramped inside but it doesn't at all. I got the 1.6 Eco-Boost and so far with only 150 miles on it is getting around 23 miles per gallon mostly around town driving. Plenty of power and love all the options. Panorama roof is great in this summer weather all most like having a convertible. Will let you know more after I have put some more miles on it. Also very sharp car gets looks everywhere we go..
