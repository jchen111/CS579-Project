I nicknamed it "The Ugly Duckling" because my first instinct was to NOT buy it.
However, my husband and son fell in love with it and I agreed because it's a Nissan (this is our 5th Nissan) and a manual (I hate automatic cars).
My husband drove it exclusively for the first month until I tried it out.
I refuse to give it back!
I've been driving for more than 40 years and this car is the BEST I've ever driven.
It has incredible power, amazing maneuverability, and is good on gas.
There are NO blind spots.
Really grabs the road.
