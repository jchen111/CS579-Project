Purchased in November 2013 and put almost 2500 miles on it...mileage is improving and last tank was 28.5 with city and freeway miles.
This is my third Honda (1980's Accord and previous was 2006 Pilot).
All have been extremely reliable and good value for the money, if somewhat bland in driving.
The CR-V adds more tech toys with iPod integration, bluetooth connection for my iPhone, and streaming audio which I havent played with yet.
Abundant interior room to hold my bikes and surfboards (similar to Pilot although somewhat smaller).
Highly recommended but wish I would have test-driven the Suburu Forrester turbo to compare the performance.

I finally decided to buy a Honda CR-V, not becaue I liked it any better than any of the others I had seen, but because I had grown tired of looking and it had most of what I wanted and it seemed to be fine when I took it for a test drive.
The navigation system worked with easy commands which was great. After I purchased the vehicle the most annoying was that the sun visor didn't extend so I had the full sun in my face.
The ride was very rough and the seats were very uncomfortable, and I had back issues by the end of the week.
I traded the vehicle in and got a 2014 Nissan Rogue that I now love!

I am elderly.
I have had many, many cars.
This is my first Honda, and I have to say, I am thrilled with this vehicle.
Zero problems, so far, great gas mileage, more performance than I expected from this little 2.4.
