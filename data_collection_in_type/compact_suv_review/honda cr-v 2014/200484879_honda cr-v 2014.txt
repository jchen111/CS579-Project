My biggest complaint is with the navigation system, which isn't user friendly and the Bluetooth has horrible reception. I can hear the caller ok, but they always say I sound like I'm underwater. I've had it into service several times and been unable to get it fixed, so I haven't even used it in over a year. $3000 upgrade is useless! I've since discovered the cars with the best Bluetooth our Cadillac and Toyota, then Kia. The transmission has jerked from day one, and I think it would be nice if the back hatch had an automatic button.

There are a lot of things about this car I love but it has three really poor features that Honda should fix.
First, when driving around 90 to 95 kph there is an intermittent, high-pitched whine that can be loud enough to hear over the radio.
Honda says it's a "characteristic" of the vehicle, although both the salesman and the mechanic admitted to me that it's loud enough to drive you crazy on a long trip. Second, I paid about $800 for the navigation system only to find the GPS to be almost useless.
I finally added a $150 GPS from Costco to help me find my way.
Third, if you're driving a lot in the U.S., take a look at the grayed-out mph markings on the speedometer.

After three Accords, dating back to 1994, my wife and I purchased our 2014 CRV.
My wife is the primary driver, and she loves the higher seating position.
Also, both of us find the vehicle to be very comfortable on long trips.
We've put on 4K miles in the first 2 months we've owned it.


The mileage isn't great as far as what is available in vehicles today, but for a new AWD vehicle, it gets in the high 20's.
Our best mileage was on a trip returning to Phoenix from Show Low, Arizona where we got 32.5 mpg, but it is mostly downhill.

Some reviewers find the 5 speed automatic to be outdated, but we have found that the unit works just fine in this application. 

We love our CRV.

The 2014 Honda CR-V EX-L AWD with navigation is a very nice SUV.
I can see why it is ranking 4 to 5 stars.
I bought this one about a month or so ago and my wife and I both like it very much.
We traded in a 2012 Toyota Rav4
4x4 Limited.
We enjoyed the Rav4 and it served us well.
No complaints.
But the one we had did not have built-in navigation like this Honda and what you get when you get the Honda navigation is voice command capability for many things, like your heat & A/C, phone, and supposedly navigation (but like most guys, I haven't read the manual, so I need to learn how to do that).
Lots technology.
Very smooth ride.
23.1 avg mpg to date.
Hoped for more.
But like the car.

I went to a Honda dealership initially to look at a Crosstour, but to get one with Navigation was just a little beyond my financial reach. So I looked at the CR-V EX-L With Navigation and was pleasantly surprised. I've now owned it for 8 days and just shy of 1000 miles on it and I'm hooked! I Love it! Cargo space is nice and large, fit a huge box for a carpet steam cleaner with ease. And so far I'm getting high 20's low 30's for gas mileage. I admit I was a bit hesitant to buy the vehicle when I saw a couple reviews that people had complained about visibility at night with the 2013 model, but I have no trouble seeing at night what so ever with mine. Stereo, Navi & leather seats are great!

I have been looking for a car for the past 2 months after my Mazda Protege of 15 years died. I wanted something a bit classy, good on gas, but with bells and whistles. I looked at the Lexus, gorgeous car, but the price was too high. I looked at the Acura MDX and the gas mileage was not all that great.
Then I looked at the Honda CR-V, after my first test drive I was hooked. It handles very well, I sit a bit higher so I feel safer and with all the air bags
I know I am safe. It gets 28 mpg, which is awesome!! The navigation system and XM radio make me feel a bit spoiled! I also love the fact that when I alert my car that I am arriving at night the headlights come on, just comforting. Luv it
