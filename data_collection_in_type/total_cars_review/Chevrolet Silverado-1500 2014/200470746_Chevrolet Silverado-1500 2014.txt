I traded my '07 Avalanche for the '14 Silverado thinking the new motor and 6 speed tranny would be a path to better fuel economy. Not so much. The tranny constantly hunts for the proper gear and the AFM system is so cludgy that the whole truck lurches when it goes in and out of V4 mode. Its been to the dealer for the recall to remap the idle which has lowered the already low city MPG from 17 to 16 (sorry performance for a standard cab). I tried installing a Diablo tuner to fix the AFM but they're maps weren't any better. They just turned off the V4 mode, which made the fuel economy even worse. It's a shame because other than the mapping and tranny I enjoy the features of the truck

I drove and considered the Ford
platinum ,the Ram Laramie along with the Silverado LTZ . All were really nice trucks. I chose the Silverado because it clearly drove and rode like a modern sedan,the Ram had a slightly better ride but drove like a truck and used a lot of gas,the Ford looked and drove like an older design..With 700 miles I can report the gas mileage is excellent. Today I drove 70 miles to a boat dealer to pick up a 15' jon boat and trailer. With 2 adults driving 70 or better I averaged 24.8mpg.Return trip with boat and trailer(estimated weight 600 lbs) I averaged 19.8 mpg. Not bad for a 5000 lb truck with 4wd. Fit and finish is excellent interior and exterior.
