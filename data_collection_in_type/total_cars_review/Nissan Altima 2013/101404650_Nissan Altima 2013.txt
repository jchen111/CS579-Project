I purchased a 2013 Nissan Altima 2.5 SL 1 year and 2 months ago and I have 86,000 miles on it as of today. I took it to the dealership and told them what was happening and they said oh your not under warranty and the mechanic said it did not engage for him. So, with that being said I spoke to management to make them aware of the issue and I recorded what the problem was doing.
They offered me a rental and a trade in value which would make my payments higher. They should fix the problem and make the customers happy.

We leased a 2012 for a couple of years. Ran flawlessly, pretty comfortable, fun to drive.
Lease ran out so we leased a 2013. 2013 engine is powerful with great gas mileage; weird high pitch whining, rattling though. I find the driver's seat to be one of the most uncomfortable I've ever sat in. Very difficult to find a comfortable position that doesn't cause back pressure. Passengers in back don't find those too comfy either.
Gearshift console is very instrusive which further compromises comfort. The dashboard is extremely reflective.
Even in low light, you are always looking through a reflection of the dash.
In strong sunlight, it's a safey hazard.
Designed by monkeys!

As previously mentioned, CVT Drivetrain sucks!!
This was my first Nissan Product and most certainly my last. I took my lumps and traded it
on a very nice Hyundai Sonata ( while they had
their rebate offers ). That helped with the loss 
I took on it. I previously had a Hyundai Azera,
a great Car ( for 6 years ). I just found out this
morning that Nissan issued a recall on the 3.5
Engine CVT, but not the 2.5. Technical Bulletin
issued just last week. I would very strongly
suggest this Vehicle with a poorly designed &
engineered drivetrain be avoided !!!

Hello future buyer,
If you are willing to go Nissan service center at least once a month, you can buy this car.

Please go Nissan forum first and check what are problems of this car.
[HTML removed.]

My case is RPM suddenly down to 800 RPM at 20-30 mph range, it feel like loosening power. Not always. 800 RPM means car stopped at the road with engine running. Extremely nervous situation because car bounced with bang sound from power train. 

Nissan have to step up to recall for CVT problem.

I purchased a 2013 pearl white Nissan Altima about a month ago.
When driving the car home from the dealership my husband and I stopped by a restaurant to eat and it was just beginning to get dark outside when my husband noticed a some light and dark stripes on the drivers side door, didn't think much about it until the next when it was light outside and could get a better look and also asked our son to look at the car to make sure he could also see the stripping or like tiger stripes and it's definately visible. We also noticed at local dealerships there were also pearl white altima's with the same discoloration on the doors. So if you are deciding to buy a Pearl White Nissan Altima BE WARE

I have 2k miles on this vehicle and can say the 2013 Altima is what a mid-sized car should be, solid build, great fuel economy, very comfortable seats, solid on-center steering, very stylish, no-problems with quality, very quiet on the hwy. 
I have had no humming or noises, the car just drives very smoothly.

The experience buying this Altima is truly unique - I normally don't test drive much, only trusted my research. Served me well til this time. First new car (28 mile) had a seat belt light malfunction at delivery. Car back to dealer and seat occupancy sensor had to be replaced. Dealer agreed to swap another new car (29 mile). 3 days, front panel showed system error, car had to be towed back to dealer, took 1 week to repair. Nissan needs to improve QC!!!

I have had the car for all of a week new. Previously mostly a Honda/Acura owner. Liked the design and the promise of great fuel economy wanted to try something new.

To date I am seriously doubting my purchase of a new Nissan. The factory in Tennessee as others have mentioned has some serious quality control issues.

For starters both front doors rub against the frame or fender when opening or closing. Also it appears that seat heaters were wired incorrectly from the factory.

In addition, the CVT has a hesitation at about 1500 rpm and vibrates the car.

Guess thats why people buy Hondas.

On July 5, 2012, I drove to the dealership to discuss issues with the 2011 Juke I had purchased the year before.
I didnÂ’t know anything about the new 2013 Altima, but one of them was on the lot and I must say, it was LOVE at first sight. I traded in the Juke and
I thought it would be a romance that lasted forever. Disappointment however set in quickly (as with the Juke). One month later, the BRAKE light came on. Shortly after that I started hearing the brakes squeak and most recently noticed that if I am on the cell phone and get in the car, there is a considerable lag time for the bluetooth to pick up the call.
I have taken the car in 5 times and nothing has been fixed. Lemon.
