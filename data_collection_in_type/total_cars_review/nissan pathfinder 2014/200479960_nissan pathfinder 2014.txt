I have only had it for almost 300 miles now, but it drives very well. It is a great ride, super comfortable and loaded with features. If you spend the extra money and get the Platinum model with all the extra features, you will be happy that you did. Hopefully wont have any of the transmission issues, but looking forward to taking it on a road trip in the near future to see how it does for a long haul drive.

Hello,
 I purchased a 2014 Nissan Pathfinder in october 2013 and the following day it started shuddering at around 20mph and the steering wheel would start vibrate at 50mph.
Then I had a weird feeling when using the brakes and they told me it was normal
I told Nissan, they did not mention the issues the 2013 model had...
I had to find out by myself online...I should have done my homework before...
I also noticed a loss of power when accelerating and the gas mileage is between 15 and 19 after driving it for 3 months.
I received a recall notification a few weeks ago for the barkes and my car is going to the shop again tomorrow.
I had to fight to get a rental car while they work on it...

We just picked up a 2014 Pathfinder on year-end closeout; paid <$35K for the Platinum (no premium)
Other car is a 2008 Infiniti M35, and I can safely say that this Pathfinder is our M35 with a 3rd row!
We looked at the Flex Limited and CX-9 Grand Touring, and the Nissan just flat-out wins.
Yes, we did look at the JX35/QX60, but I cannot see the difference to justify a 12K gap in pricing (wake up Infiniti, and put the 3.7 in there...)

Kudos too to the Nissan buying experience; Ford is still stuck in Anchorman-era.
Mazda offers compelling choices, and I will probably kick myself when the diesel CX-9 comes out next year, but here's to X-MAS bonuses

I have owned my pathfinder a month and still love it. I have put on 1500 miles so far. I purchased the premium platinum package with the rear DVD system and the biggest problem we have is the kids fighting over which DVD to watch. I went from a GMC Yukon and was worried at first about going to a smaller SUV but I was pleasantly surprised how roomy the interior actually is. I have not had any of the transmission problems that I have read about in the other reviews the pathfinder is really a fun car to drive.

I have been very happy w/ my '14 Pathfinder Platinum since taking delivery 3 weeks ago. I felt this vehicle was the best value in this category. I also strongly considered the GMC Acadia and favored the electronics on the GMC, but the drivers seat in Pathfinder and price for the amount of options out weighed the GMC.
