The Nissan pathfinder is the best overall suv you will ever buy, longer lasting less maintenance, less expensive  than most but not just a better value they drive awesome with the cvt transmission, they are quality built and so very comfy if you have kids. Get the sl version it's just below the platinum the top level but you have the option to get the premium package that has the full sky light sunroof I. The back the Bose and the heated seats and super premium leather. Everything about it makes so much more sense than all the crap new do serif SUVs that are more expensive and just break down. There is not one suv that literally beats the pathfinder in looks(sexy mobile) or anything else

This car has everything that we wanted and needed for a family car. The best feature that this car comes with is the sliding rows. When you have children in a car seat is that the middle you are able to completely move it forward without having to take the carseat out. Also the leg room in the front passenger has with a carseat in back is awesome. We traded in my two year old Ford Explorer to the Pathfinder because of the lack of leg room and every time someone needed to sit in the third row we needed to take the carseat out.

I bought a 2014 Pathfinder SL in Nov. 2013.
I have owned a dozen Nissans, all high quality and reliable.
How Nissan could turn out a vehicle with so many complaints about the CVT Transmission is very disappointing.
I feel betrayed and will NEVER buy Nissan again. They remind me of Detroit quality control in the 1980's. I will sell it asap.
I have had it in the shop 5 times in 3 months for acceleration problems, shakiness, poor power range.
I could go on, but why.
I have read the complaints of others and know I am not alone.
So if anyone reads this with Nissan, I hope you are satisfied at how much of your customer base is revolting against the product that endangers our families.

Bought my 2014 SL 4x4 in Aug. 2013. I already have 21k miles on it. We bought this car for the incredible leg room and the towing capacity & we had previously owned a 2007 pathfinder & had no problems with it.
At between 3k - 5k miles we did experience the shudder, took it into the dealer, they fixed it & we haven't had any problems since.
This is a great car. Smooth ride, great features, love the leg room, good gas mileage, fun to drive, reasonably priced & we have had tons of compliments on it.

Just bought a new Pathfinder SL with the tech package.
I only have 400 miles on it so far, but it seems real solid.
Great ride, quiet, and I like the seating position, which is very comfortable.
