As a long time Toyota fan, I was delighted that the Corolla was seriously upgraded for 2014. I have always been impressed with the Corolla's build quality and reliability but it was in danger of being left behind in the compact car segment due to a lack of style and current technology. After trading in my 2010 S model for a new LE Plus, I could not be happier. The styling, ride, technology and interior room are greatly improved. Granted this is no sports car, but this has the quietest ride in the compact class and is as smooth as glass on the interstate at 80 mph. The CVT shifts smoothly and fuel economy is noticeably better. All of this at a better price than either Honda Civic or Mazda 3.

Overall I rate my car a 5. If you read auto magazines they rate the cars on performance mostly. The Corolla is not a sports car , don`t judge it that way. What it is , is a very dependable car. It has very good gas mileage. Since my last odo reset I am at a 38.5 mpg average over 2000 miles . Over the winter I had a 32 mpg average. Cars use more gas running cold. very comfortable ride and seats. If you look at the mpg ratings the Corolla does better than most cars that are smaller than it.Love the look of the dash , all the other cars basically look the same dash . It is very similar to the Avalon dash.

I chose the Corolla over the 2014 Mazda 3. I have about 600 miles on mine now. In most ways, the Mazda is the better car - better handling, more power, better fuel economy, better build quality. But I don't regret my choice. The Corolla has more interior space, better visibility, and better features for less money, comparably equipped. Noise levels are on-par with the Mazda, but could be better (sadly, not close to the Chevy Cruze).The handling is well improved over previous Toyotas I've driven, and the seats are supportive and comfortable. Overall this is an easy, economical car to live with and I quite enjoy it.

I was looking to trade in my Honda Fit which I loved, for a larger, quieter, smoother riding car for my 65 mile round trip commute to work. Yet I still wanted the efficiency and reliability of the Fit. I cross shopped between the 2013 Civic and the newly designed 2014 Corolla. I initially liked the Civic better, but after driving each car again I realized how good of a job Toyota did. Advantages of the Corolla are: many more premium features for less money, better looking exterior, CVT transmission, nicer interior design with better gauges, automatic climate control, touch screen display screen, much nicer looking wheel choices, unique interior color choices, and a very quiet planted ride.
