Nice car! Love the redesign (Inside & out)! Not as peppy as my 2006 S. Planned on driving my 06 for 5 more years as was so dependable, but totaled it so needed a new car. I chose the S Plus due to the disc brakes all the way around. Purchased with the convenience package. Love the XM and blue tooth which I didn't have before. With that said, I am so DISAPPOINTED with the gas mileage. My 06 got 33 MPG consistently. This car barely gets 29 MPG. They advertise as 35 MPG which is NOT true. But it's still a nice car. As far as reliability, that remains to be seen. Oh yea, I put 5,000 miles on it so far, and still can't get rid of the epoxy smells when I accelerate. Seems to come thru the vents.

I needed a commuter car to drive almost 100 miles a day back and forth to work. I also own a 2014 Corvette Stingray and a 2013 BMW M3 Coupe and wanted to keep the miles off them. I have driven the Corolla about 1,500 miles and really like it. The rear leg room is great and I have been averaging 34 MPG. I really like the exterior styling of the car and the interior looks like it belongs in a much more expensive car. I opted for the S Plus as it adds a lot of features for very little money. This is a great commuter car but do not expect great performance or an exciting ride. If you want something that is comfortable, looks nice, drives nice and gets great MPG then this is the car for you.

This cars is awesome! I'm getting 31 m.p.g. in town and it is not broke in yet! I can tell you that you will be wasting your time on a Honda, Mazda, or Nissan in this group. This Corolla looks sharper and is thousands less with a back up camera. The CVT trans. is really a great invention. I have 6 speeds and you can't feel it shift. In the Sport Mode I can move the shifter over to M and Paddle shift through 6 speeds. I am so impressed with the performance and engineering of this car Im tickled to own it. The interior is well laid out and again is nicer than the other brands. The car feels very solid, go test drive one and you will be signing your name on a contract.

I test drove the Mazda 3, liked it but getting the features I wanted drove the price into the stratosphere.
Decided on the Camry SE and went to purchase it.
It was just so....blah.
Ended up test driving the Corolla S Plus.
Did not feel like a compact.
Feels roomy inside, big backseat, and fun to drive too.
Ended up getting a deal too good to pass up on a fully loaded little red Corolla S Plus w/driver's convenience package.
My husband wanted the Camry, but he has come around after driving the Corolla a few times.
It is far more fun to drive and has plenty of room for my teenagers who exceed 6 ft tall in the back!

Bought this 2014 Corolla S Plus in Dec 2013., I Traded in a 2010 Corolla S.
I have noticed Many improvements over the 2010 Model, I really like the CVT Trans. over the Manual.
I had a Manual in the 2010 and I did test the Manual in the 2014.
I am very surprised at the superb acceleration of the CVT over the Manual, The Engine revs. high and stays high in the power band through all gears up to 70+ mph.
It is quite impressive & fun! Don't waste your time on a Manual, get a manual trans. in a sports car with a V-8 & feel the power there. Do yourself a big favor & Test drive all the Corolla models, you will see a significant difference in Handling and performance when you get to the S & S+

Before purchasing my Corolla I test drove a Hyundai Elantra and the Mazda 3 at the same price point $21,500 . 
To me the 2014 Corolla has the best quality,features and styling.
The dash reminds me of a 1972 Chevelle.... in a good way. I really like the Blue tooth, back up camera Sport seats are really comfortable with lots of adjustments. large sunroof. The S model wheels are awesome!
The CVT trans is great on the highway. To me it accelerates strange in the city on hills. The sport mode is fun with shift points. makes it feel pretty fast. Paddle shifters? really? I probably wont use them much.

I
was
going
to
buy
a
Honda
Civic but
then I
changed
my
mind
because the red
color is only available with a
disgusting beige interior, the seats reminded me
of
my
grandfathers
TV couch.
 So
I
bought
a
Corolla S-Plus with the convenience
package. I just
returned
from a
700 mile test drive
to Los Angeles.
What
I
can say
is
that
I
am less
tired
now
compared
to the
same
trip in
other
vehicles.
Driving at
speeds of
up
to 80 mp/h feels
like
driving
60
in
other
vehicles.
 The noise
level is
 low,
the
suspension
and
steering
are
excellent,
the
climate
control
is
very
user
friendly.
