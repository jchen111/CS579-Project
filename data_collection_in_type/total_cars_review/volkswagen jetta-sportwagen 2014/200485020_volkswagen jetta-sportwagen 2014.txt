Bought this car because we needed something reasonably priced, great mileage, that can haul things around.
First VW we have owned, we have owned BMW, Acura, Honda.
Very happy so far with the purchase.
Excellent driving, very good mileage (over 40 mpg....), plenty big, love the manual, and the turbo diesel.
