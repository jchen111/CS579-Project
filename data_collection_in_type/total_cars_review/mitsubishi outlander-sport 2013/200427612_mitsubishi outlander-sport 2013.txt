I bought my 2013 pearl white Outlander Sport in November, 2013.
I have over 32,000 miles on it so far, not a bit of trouble. I usually read professional reviews before I buy anything but this time I didn't. My Ford Taurus was costing a fortune in repairs. I wanted good mileage and all the bells and whistles. I looked at Honda and various other cars, despite the higher prices, could not find the extras I wanted. The Outlander Sport fits the bill and more. After reading professional reviews, I was embarrassed for buying a so-called "loser". However, talking with other owners and my own experience, I'm so glad I didn't read before I bought. Mitsubishi needs to put out the word. Real bargain!

I want to let you know that I and my wife own an outlander sport. mine is a 2013 pearl white, and my wifes car is a 2012 and neither of us will trade them we love them that much

Wishing for better mileage - Got about 25 on my first all highway road trip. Not much better than I get in town. Maybe it will get better when the engine loosens up a little.
Wishing for more performance - Not terrible but far from a "Sporty" experience
Wishing for nicer finishes - nothing objectionable, but it seems it could be better with just a little effort

Could not be happier with the deal, though. I would have had to pay several thousand more to get a Crossover I liked better. Warranty is great, too. I'm glad because my previous Monterro cost me a ton and was worth nothing when I traded it in.

I purchased the vehicle about 3 months ago and I have logged just over 3,300 miles on it. It has a galore of technology features, comparable to any of the luxury vehicles out there, at a much affordable price. It looks great from the exterior and drives very smooth. The mpg rating for this vehicle is 24/31/27 but I am now averaging a combined mpg of 32, better than the official rating of 27. I calculate my mpg by dividing the total mileage travelled for a fill up by the amount of gas needed to bring the gas tank back to another fill up and I have done this 3 times. Of course, my city driving is only 20%, back-roads is 60% and highways is 20%.

Very pleased with this SUV after having it a couple of months now.
I hear people complain about how their Bluetooth or other features do not work right on their cars, but mine does and everything else works well too.
No problems at all.
In 80%highway at 70 mph/20%city driving, I was averaging about 28 mpg, but once I passed the 2,000 mile break in period it has jumped to about 31 mpg (could also be the switch over from the winter gas at the stations too).
This is actual mileage, where I do the math after filling up at the gas station.
The trip meter seems to understate mileage a little bit. This SUV also has sharp looks and is well built.
It's my first Mitsubishi and I am impressed.

Mitsubishi does not do a good enough job marketing this vehicle.
They are either pricing it
to regain market share or the other brands are way overpriced. That being said, I had checked out most other small SUVs, focusing on the American & Japanese models.
They are all in the 25-30K range to get the features this one has. With rebates and negotiations with the dealer I got this great quality SUV for about $19,200.
For this price, who else gives 18" alloys, keyless ignition, fog lights, auto & adjustable HID headlights, tinted windows, auto heat/air, rain sensing wipers, super crisp LED multi-color info. display, wireless Bluetooth, 6 speaker satellite radio and much more??? No one!!!
