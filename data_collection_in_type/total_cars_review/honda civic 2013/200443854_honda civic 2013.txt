This is our third Civic LX in a row, which kind of says it right there.
I only bought this one because I promised our '07 to my college-age son. Not as zippy as the '07 with Econ button pressed, but I did get 41.7 mpg on the first road trip. Ride is also quieter and smoother than before.
And one annoyance fixed: The driver's side floor mat has EZ-twist buttons for removal instead of those frustrating hooks!
I've rented just about every other small car, including a Corolla in '10, but the Civic remains the gold standard of its class.

This sedan has enough hi-tech features to wow.
Interior is comfortable but feels confined (I replaced a 2008 Camry hybrid) but reasonably comfortable for medium distance trips. I only have the car for two weeks and filled the tanks twice. In town I was averaging 23-24 mpg. I took a 10-hour round trip mostly at 55-60 mph
I was getting close to 39-40 mpg.
On acceleration the car has a tendency to be jerky if the gas pedal is released. After driving the round trip for close to 9 hrs my back started to get stiff.
A lower back support may be the next item I should try. 
The trunk is small but acceptable; it could accommodate 2 sets of golf clubs with room for overnight luggage.
