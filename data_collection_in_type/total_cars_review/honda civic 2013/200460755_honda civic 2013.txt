After driving a 2002 WRX, 2009 Forester XT (turbo), a tuned 1990's Altima (w/ slip diff), I'm happy to say the new Si is the best of them all!

Road & wind noise are minimized, hearing only the rough & grumble growl of the engine.
A
buttery smooth clutch with short throws is easy & fun.

Front slip diff performs remarkably, & even makes driving on all season 17" / 45s in snow & slush tolerable (I normally have snow tires).
Ergos are nice, especially the back split fold down seats, center arm rest, matched int colors, & standard back-up camera.

Of course there could be more space & luxury, like an Acura TSX or Audi A4.
But then again, you won't pay $30k++ for the Si!
Grade: A+
