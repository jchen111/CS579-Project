Overall the car has performed its purpose and I am satisfied.
There are a few things I am disappointed with, first being the paint.
The car is black on black, and have had it almost 10 months and put on over 20,000 miles.
The car looks like it has been through a sandblaster.
My old car, a 1998 Honda civic, is in about the same condition but it took 14yrs of wear to get in that condition.
Its pretty disappointing to have a car less than a year old look this bad.
Second, the mileage is mediocre.
Average 31 mpg highway, although I don't ever drive city so I don't know if it would stay the same or get worse.
In Hondas defense, the highway speed is usually 75-80mph so that doesn't help.
