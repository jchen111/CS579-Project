I just purchased the vehicle and love it!
The car is extremely fun to drive.
One of the main reasons was the TDI option providing over 42+ MPG which is just phenom.
I was used to getting about 17Mpg-23Mpg at best in a previous vehicle.
Time to go more economical and practical.
The car is 4 doors and White.
Looks just sweet and awesome.
 Really a fun car and there are so many pluses about this model.

I did my homework to get my wife an economical car that would be an upgrade to her horrid corolla. Went with the TDI due to its track history. Fuel economy is better than EPA estimates. Driving it is smooth, fun and flawless. My wife loves to push its acceleration abilities. Handles brilliantly. Brakes are solid. The displays are great and intuitive. Bluetooth audio is pretty sweet as well -they don't advertise that feature. I like driving it more than my Saab 9-3 2.0T except for the fact that it is red. This car beats many Audi's in price and comfort (same maker, I know).
Overall, the best car I have owned and one of the few I would buy new due to its high resale value.
