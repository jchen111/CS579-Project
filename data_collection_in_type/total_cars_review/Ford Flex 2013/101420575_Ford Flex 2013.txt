We got rid of an Odyssey after 12 years and bought the Edge.
Had it for two years and found it too small for 4 and a dog.
Checked out the Flex one day and it was really a pleasant surprise.
Big seats that heat and cool, powerful engine for passing.
AWD for the snow and ice we have.
It rides like a heavy car use to ride, but handles like a dream.
Drove in two mountain passes with 4-5 inches of unplowed snow at 28 degrees.
No slush and it handled well.
I did notice some slipping in corners, but I was going fast for the conditions.
It corrected itself well.
Kids are almost 6' and have super leg room in the rear.

My First Flex was a 2010 Limited with EcoBoost.
It was one of the first production models with Ecoboost and I had some growing pains with turbos brakes, calipers, and fuel injection.
Ford covered it all with no complaints. I just bought a 2013 Flex with Ecoboost and this car is a total upgrade to the 2010. Ride, power, comfort, quietness, amenities are totally transformed.
Ford totally believes in this car with the engineering upgrades they have done.
I put a lot of windshield time behind the wheel being a salesman.
This car rocks for someone needing carrying capacity, comfort, yet entertaining to drive, its quick.
Its a Mini Cooper on steroids.

I was looking or a larger car yet didn't want a sit up high SUV. I liked these when they first came out yet was hessitant so waited a few years and I am glad I did. It glides real smooth when driving it has great handling and turning radius. Not hard to park. The eco boost is awesome. It gets up and goes when you hit the peddle. Great for long hauls and short hauls. Highway and back roads with all the curves. I have over 3,000 miles on it and can't complain. Teenagers and friends fit in fine. can carry 4 dogs 4 adults and some with no problem. If you want a minivan look at this first. Has all wheel drive too.
