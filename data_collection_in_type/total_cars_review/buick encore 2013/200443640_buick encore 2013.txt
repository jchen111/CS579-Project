After purchasing the vehicle new June 29, 2013 and logging approximately 3000 miles, I am very satisfied.
After a recent trip of 2850 miles in 10 days through highways, interstates, and the back roads and mountain roads of West Virginia, I am very satisfied.
From Indiana to Florida and back, the car averaged 33.2 miles per gallon running the air conditioning all of the time.
I was originally concerned that it might lack power in the mountains but I was pleasantly surprised.
I was able to pass on hills and the Encore was responsive to quick acceleration.
The car was very comfortable.
The convex blind spot mirrors take some time to get used to but I am very pleased with the vehicle.

Bought this after driving the other small suv choices. This had the best options and the best ride for the money. This is a small vehicle, but has plenty of front legroom for my wife and I. Those that complain about the lack of power, this is not and not meant to be an enclave. I find adequate power, just push down a little farther on the gas pedal. As an empty-nester this car does what we bought it for, comfort, quiet, room to carry cargo and pets with rear seats folded and good gas mileage.

After two months of car shopping, I ended up right where I started & that's gotta say something about my new ride! After GM agreed to buy back my 2011 Chevy Equinox because it was a lemon, I suddenly found myself test driving everything from the Toyota prius to the Chevy cruze.

In the end I went with the Encore because it's a snappy little SUV with great MPG & even though my Chevy was a lemon, GM did right by me & took care of it with little effort on my behalf.

Picked up this emergency upgrade from a 2006 Scion xB on 2/7/13. As I heard, xB upgrade was some of Buick's engineer's purpose for Encore design.
This review is my first impressions. 

So far, I hate one and only thing: bling. All Leather Group Encores that were available right now had chrome wheels and you can't change it. This is an addition of $1,000 to the total car price that was forced down my throat by some schlub on Buick's payroll who decided that's what the first batch of Leather Group Encores should have. There are other decorative, non functional "design" elements that I am learning to tolerate.
Fake plastic hood vents are not cool, despite what the hoodlums are saying.

Enjoying this vehicle very much.
My wife will be driving it and she loves the size and design. Great mpg, very quiet and fun to drive.
Looks small on the outside but seems big on the inside.
Engine is not overpowering but very peppy.
Is a small turbo that uses regular gas.... with mid to high 20's mpg for in-town driving. Fit and finish is very good.
