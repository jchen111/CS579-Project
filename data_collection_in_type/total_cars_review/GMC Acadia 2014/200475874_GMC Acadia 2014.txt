First off I like everything about this car.
Ok, well not everything.
I have owned it for 10 days and
on day 3 it was back to the dealer to get a massive oil leak fixed.
Cheap Chinese oil filter housing cracked and allowed oil to leak past the filter seal.


The remote start works maybe 50% of the time.
The gas gauge wanders from 1/8 tank to just under 1/2 full which causes the distance to empty to wander from 50 to 120 miles.
The driver's seat moves back for easy exit even though I turned that feature off.
Now, my main gripe is I am only getting 13.8 mpg in town.
I have been driving this car like an old lady and I can not improve on that number after two tanks of gas.

Only have had my new Acadia for less than a month but have thoroughly enjoyed the ride! Smooth ride but wish it would come in rear wheel drive instead of front wheel drive. The jury is still out on the mileage however I only have less that 1,000 miles on it but for city driving I am averaging about 16-17 mpg. Exterior design is better than the ugly Terrain.
Why can't whitewall tires be an option? It really adds some style. Black wall tires tend to make vehicle look bland and cheap.
The same is true about pin striping. I added pin striping and WOW what a difference. I remember when cars came with pin striping and whitewalls.
