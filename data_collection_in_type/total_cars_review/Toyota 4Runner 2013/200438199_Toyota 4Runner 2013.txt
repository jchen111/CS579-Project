I have had 4Runners in the past,
so I knew I would be getting a quality product.
I was right.
I enjoy everything about the 4Runner. It is equally at home in "high society" or pulling a boat down a gravel road.
I will say that I'm shocked at how harsh the media has been on this new model.
IMO, that is due to the fact that most review agencies are centered in urban areas.
They would prefer everyone drive compact cars,
so they naturally prefer car based SUV's and have trouble understanding people that actually plan to use an SUV outside of grocery and soccer duty.
Do not let subjective reviews get to you.
They are comparing it to a car in every respect.
It is not a "car".
