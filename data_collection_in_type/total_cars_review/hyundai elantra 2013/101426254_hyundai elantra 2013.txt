I purchased the Elantra limited in 2012 after having done a bit of research on the vehicle for mpg, value, and etc. And after driving nearly 78k miles I can say that there are better vehicles for the money. I am on my second set of tires and both sets have horrible road noise that is amplified when stopping on wet pavement. I have had the car looked at by the dealer and they can't find anything. Also the steering wheel would pull to the left since the day I drove the car off the lot to which again the dealer said nothing wrong.

I do not understand negative reviews about gas mileage! The LOWEST we have gotten is 32.5. We live in an extremely hilly area.....rural, lots of stops, starts, slow down for curves and accelerating on steep hills. On the hwy., we get over 38 mpg. We previously owned a Ford Focus and a Chevy Impala (which I hated!) and the Hyundai Elantra Limited is way above and beyond both vehicles. The ride is so much quieter and smoother. The features in the Limited surpass the Ford Focus by miles!

1.
It's rated well by Consumer Reports.
2.
Looking good inside and out doesn't make for a quality car.
3.
I feel ripped off and I did my research.
I'm currently looking to trade it in with @1100 mi.
4.
I shouldn't have purchased the vehicle...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When researching which new car to purchase, the deciding factors in the end were that I had an Elantra for 12 years and it was very reliable, and I wanted a car with decent gas mileage.

So far it's been reliable, though a few small things have failed already.
But the gas mileage is just plain terrible.
If I had known, I would have gotten the car I really wanted that had weaker gas mileage instead!

Recently purchased a 2013 Elantra Limited under the premise that I would be getting a fuel efficient vehicle for a decent price.
I traded a 2012 Camaro to make this deal as I travel 65 miles a day to work and back in hybrid traffic.
I drive pretty conservatively and live in Florida which is predominately flat.
With the first 1,000 miles down, I am getting 25.4 MPG which is a far cry from the 28C-38H-32Hybrid they are so fond of telling you about.
My Camaro was getting 20.6 hybrid, so I gained far less car with no real savings.
The Elantra is a great car for what it is, but if you are seeking this vehicle solely for gas mileage, don't make the mistake.
You won't see the stated mileage.

2013 Hyundai Elantra unsafe to drive, accelertion malfunction.
I have purchased a brand new 2013 Hyundai Elantra which has accelerated unexpectedly 2 times and the last time, the car was not able to be stopped before it crashed into a concrete wall.
We have had the car checked by Hyundai through their 6 week process and they have come back to us with a letter stating nothing was wrong. When we asked for a copy of the testing they said they were proprietary and they could not give me a copy.
Where do you go from here?

Purchased 05.14.2013 had it in the shop for bluetooth not downloading contacts, delivered with scratch on glove box door and window tint not done properly on 05.24.2013, windows retinted, glove box door replaced bluetooth problem not fixed.
The way vehicle drove seemed odd took a few weeks to get use to it, noticed it was pulling to the right and the steering wheel was not centered and extensive wear on left front tire.
Bluetooth still will not download contacts have tried several different phones.
Dealership told me that steering wheel and pulling to right would not be covered by warranty, even though it has driven that way since i got it with 65 miles on it.
Making another appointment.

I bought the limited 2013 brand new and it has had problems from day.
Not to mention they lied about the MPG, and now there is a recall for the car.
Also when you step on the brakes hard the whole car sounds like its about to fall apart.
Stay away from Hyundai's they are not what they used to be.
THey are having problems with all of their cars now.
You will see massive recalls and their business will go down.
THey are pushing leases now so people dont realize what junk they bought.

Its not the car its HOW it is driven.
Great car all around ..

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not buy this car if gas mileage is important to you. I have had this car for 4 months. I get only 20 miles to the gallon on city, flat road driving. Disaster.
