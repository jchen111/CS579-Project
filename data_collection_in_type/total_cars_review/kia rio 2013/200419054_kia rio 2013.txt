BUYER BEWARE !!! The six speed has transmission issues. Vibration at highway speeds in sixth gear. I bought one. And Im not only disapointed....Im mad!!! Customer service is horrendous. Car still isnt fixed. Would never buy another KIA based on how Ive been treated. NEVER !!!!

Looked for a car to replace 2000 Toyota Echo. Shopping for price, dependability and fuel mileage. Drove Yaris, Prius C, Nissan Sentra but settled on Rio hatchback. Sold on styling both inside and out, price and warranty. Fuel mileage is okay, not special. 38 to 40 mpg is tough to swallow coming from 42 to 45 mpg. Didn't see the Yaris being any better. Prius C was too pricey for what I wanted. 6 speed manual transmission is good, though the gears are quite close together. Normal driving is easy to skip gears. Bought manual because paying for an automatic is a rip off.
