Going from Toyota Yaris 38 mpg to this 16 mpg is quite a shock but I'm learning to just deal with it. I feel powerful and guarded when I drive myself and my baby around in this vehicle. We got the V8 Hemi (which is not an option on this review) and we are both very pleased with what it has to offer. It has a tow package and though we've only towed an empty flatbed trailer it towed with ease. I like the fact that it has an "ECO" function and can detect when I don't need the full 8 cylinders and drops 4 for my city driving. Cons: can feel when it shifts, a minor shudder & hubcaps? I just dropped almost $50K and I get hubcaps?

I have put about 1200 miles on this vehicle. About 400 of those miles were used to to tow a 17' bass boat through the Ozark moutains.I can find nothing to complain about. Plenty of power when I needed it.
