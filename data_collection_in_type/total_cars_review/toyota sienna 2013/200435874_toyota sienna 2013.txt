As a mom I like this kid wagon pretty well, but have one major gripe with the design.
It's obviously meant to haul children, and almost all children are in some sort of safety restraint/seat these days.
Problem is, the 2nd and 3rd row seats have this ridiculous incline, about a 45 degree incline toward the back.
What they really need to start at is about ground level for proper installation of car seats.
I've had to roll a towel to stick under a car seat before, but this is insane.
Who thought this was a good idea??
You really have to rig it to get the child seat at the proper angle, especially for the youngest children (newborns and babies) who are rear-facing and need to be reclined.
