Main selling point was slight reliability edge as reported by Consumer reports over other minivans. However in safety, airbag counts are not a good measure. The airbags help if the structure fails and in this aspect the Honda's are many years ahead. Check out the side pole gov crash testing at safecar.gov or the small overlap front test conducted by the Insurance Inst. Hondas consistantly outscore all other models except volvos. We had a bad experience at our local dealer in Dover, DE. The price and terms were verbally agreed to but on the day of delivery they were changed in favor of the dealer. Do not deal with this dealership. Get everything in writing and signed by the owner.
