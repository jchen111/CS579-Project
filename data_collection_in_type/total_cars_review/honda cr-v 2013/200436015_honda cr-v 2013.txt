I have had my EX-L with nav for two weeks and am very happy with my purchase.
It is very comfortable and a pleasure to drive.
Much has been said about sluggish acceleration but I find the acceleration to be great for this type of vehicle and I think Honda got it right balancing responsiveness and fuel economy.
It's great having the Econ option for greater fuel economy too.
I don't find road noise to be a problem at all and think the car is well insulated.
As to the complaints about the sound system, it could be better but I am pleased with it.
Again, I didn't buy this car expecting a luxury sound.
I highly recommend this CR-V.

My senior parents are the actual owners of this vehicle, but I have driven it enough and helped them weed through numerous other vehicles (months and months of research and test driving) to feel confident in making a review. My mother's strong pull to the CR-V was the actual deciding factor in the final purchase. I feel she made a great decision!
This vehicle offers a lot for the money. We test drove countless vehicles and my parents kept coming back to this one. I was not as crazy about it as them, but see that it has many desirable features and feel it is definitely worth the money. Overall, it is a great little SUV!
