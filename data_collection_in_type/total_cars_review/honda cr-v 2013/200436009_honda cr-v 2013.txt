I love the car just took a trip from Chicago to Virginia in it and averaged 41mpg according to the onboard computer. When I did the math manually using gallons and miles from the odometer it came out to 40.2mpg.

For an SUV that is amazing! Now, I used to drive a Prius for work so I'm always watching my driving patterns and am fairly gentle on the gas. On this trip I drove about 60-65mph most of the drive and set cruise control on several occasions.

I absolutely love the car and it's big upgrade from my Honda Fit.
