I am a student that has to travel 425 miles round trip per week from home to school.
I previously had a full size pick up truck and I can not be happier with the switch to the Subaru.
I live in Northern NH and the outback is great in the snow/ice and handles well on the highway.
I have been averaging 25-27mpg highway but I suspect it mostly has to do with the terrain.
I am 6'3" and am not skinny by any means.
17,000 miles in 5 months and have been very happy so far

Had my Outback for 3 days now and really nice to drive, well laid out on the interior, handles fantastic on wet roads.

Now, for the take to heart before you buy issues. Steering not as tight as it should be, mushy brakes, noisy tranny, seriously over rated gas milage, and extremely fussy blue tooth. 

I bought this with my wife in mind as she loves Subaru. Had I to do it all over again, would have bought the Hyundai Sonata 2.0 turbo, now thats a car!


If you are considering the Outback, test drive it twice, even three times before you commit. Make sure it is exactly what you are looking for.

I purchased a 2013 Subaru Outback 2.5i Premium after extensive research.This is my first Subaru and first AWD vehicle.

After 2,700 miles of driving I have been very pleased with the performance, drivability, and features.
The car handles extremely well on all roads.


Acceleration is acceptable, with plenty of torque and power with the 4 cyl. Boxer engine. The CVT transmission takes a bit of "getting used to" as it does not shift through gears as a typical automatic transmission.

The interior is quiet and comfortable, plenty of space for 4 adults and storage in the rear cargo area.
The Outback is an exceptional value IMHO.

Got a bug one day and decided to buy an Outback!
Picked it up yesterday and am absolutely loving it!
Traded in my Mazda CX 7 for better gas mileage, regular 87 octane and Standard AWD.
A really practical, rugged, comfortable car. I really cannot say enough good thing and am totally happy with my choice!

My first OB, coming from a '04 Galant. I'm glad I did the research and waited to get the '13. We have two younger children, 10 and 7. I have 4000 mi. on it. We've taken a 1,000 mi. trip and several shorter ones ranging from 200-300 per trip. I'm looking forward to testing out the tried and true AWD in our midwest winters (WI). Cabin is spacious, especially backseats. While I'm not tall at 5'7", there is an incredible amount of legroom in the backseat.

While I never test drove the '12, the re-tuned suspension in the '13 seems to be spot on. There's virtually no body roll in corners (i.e. on and off-ramps). 

I chose it for the re-tuned engine, MPG, re-tuned suspension, and AWD combination. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As this was my first car and I'm a highly practical person who wants to make sure I make the absolute best decision for me, I drove, drumroll please... 30 cars. I even drove the 2012 and 2013 outbacks back to back to see if I could notice significant differences in the way it drove. I did. Much less body roll and more pep with slightly better gas mileage did me in. So far I've driven 1500 miles, mostly city. City, I've been averaging 23 MPG and on the highway I did about 28 with two large adults and all our junk for a vacation. I haven't done much off-roading, but I can tell this car would handle it no problemo.

Forget all you knew or read about the 2012 Subaru Outback, apart from the exterior/interior looks of the car, the 2013 had undergone a major update, new engine, new/updated CVT auto transmission and updated suspension. The new 2013 Outback handles more like a sedan than even the 2010-2012 Legacy. I've had the 2013 Outback for a week now, the pull from the new 2.5 engine is great, fells almost like a diesel engine. The CVT is much more response than earlier, before, the RPM would hit 4k and sound like a motorboat. On the new Outback, the engine RPM goes to 2k and you feel a great push forward, without any extra noise.
