Recommended.I did my research and compared to Hybrid rivals, C-Max outshines them all. It fit my tight parameters of price, style, features and performance in every comparison.
 
After test drive, Was impressed by performance, ergonomics, luxurious interior, room and comfort of a well thought out crossover vehicle.The little design touches show how well thought out it is,
The MPG debate showed realistic mileage,and after 1500 miles, now lifetime average is 37.2 and climbing.  Varies between 30's -50's (61 highest) on different trips. That's twice my 2007 Santa Fe 18.2 mpg lifetime average, so I'm happy.  I'd rather have the better performance and extra features than quibble over a few mpg

If I lived in a warm climate I would give this car rave reviews. In a cold climate, not so much. It has been reliable but the mileage and electric range in the winter are so much worse than in the summer,
about half as good.
Also, one of the big selling points to me was that I could set a departure time using my cell phone, and it would have the cabin up to a comfy temperature using wall current by the time I left.
Maybe that works on 220 volts, but on 110 it starts warming about 45 minutes before departure and never does get the cabin and it does drain the battery somewhat.
Also, the turning radius is absurdly bad.
In hybrid mode I get about 36 mpg.
After driving a Prius, that stinks.

I bought the C-Max under the pretense of getting 47 Hwy / 47 city.
I soon discovered that the EPA doesn't require testing in cold weather
The C-Max relies on EV mode to get mileage.
Living in Minnesota during the winter the engine needs to run almost constantly to keep the car warm.
Hense overall I'm averaging 41 MPG per year.
This summer I've been averaging 50+ MPG for commutes to work.

This is our first hybrid and I'm so glad we went with the C-max. It has gitty-up when you need it, plenty of space for two adults and one baby (and everything that comes with a baby). driveability is very good and comfortable. This is our second summer with the car, and we are achieving the 45-47 mark. Winter is a different story, more like 42. All in all a very good car and I'm truly surprised there are not more on the road.

I have had my Cmax for 15 days today! My best trip so far has netted 52.8 mpg, with an average of 42.7 mpg.
I bought this car for the looks and how much fun it is driving!

I can and have followed all of the hints and tips regarding driving a hybrid, and reaped those benefits, 52.8 mpg!
I have also enjoyed zipping around town, and still am getting fantastic gas mileage.

Will follow up in a few months!

I would probably be slightly disappointed if I'd paid full price for my C-Max. We bought ours used with 7k miles on it. It now has 12k. When I bought the car, the lifetime mileage was 32 mpg. Now it's 37. Hybrids are still cars. The person who previously owned this vehicle had a very short drive cycle. If you drive a short distance- less than 5 miles, you can't expect anything to get the EPA rating. My wife drives 5 miles per day. Important- be aware of the tire inflation sticker. I thought my Cmax handled like a badly, but the dealer only put 32 psi in the tires- the sticker says 42! Make sure your tires are properly inflated, the sticker is in the driver's door jamb.

This car has been to dealership 3 times to fix the poor performance on gas mileage. Advertised 47/47/47 and lately I am getting 32.5. Gas engine turns on as I am stopping! The second visit to dealership didn't even test drive. Radio doesn't turn on and off with dashboard button. Service bulletin still hasn't fixed that. I don't think they want to do more than throw the $550 check at us. 
With the sleek design and ability to put some great pzazz into this vehicle, they cut it off at the knees. Hybrid without good gas mileage is not worth anything.

The only reason I'm rating it low on comfort is the seats. Hard seats, even with leather. But all the cars I test drove had hard seats - Subarus, Toyotas, Hondas.

C-Max Hybrid is a great little zipper. Overtakes other traffic easily. Ease of entry and exit - no banging head or knees. Good storage space (but no, this is not an SUV).

I hope the C-Max will prove to be a great decision, as I spent the better part of 5 months reading articles, driving cars, comparing all aspects. My last car - Nissan Murano-2004 traded it in, before that Nissan Pathfinder 1996 and still running.

My first ever Ford, so
there is a lot at stake here - the Ford reputation. Ford, don't let me down now.

After dealing with numerous recalls and technological glitches, I am finally throwing in the towel on my 2013 C-Max (I've had it for a year). As others have pointed out, the MPG was grossly exaggerated by Ford.
At the moment, I'm dealing with relatively minor issues (i.e. entertainment system sporadically stops working, center console won't close, trunk lift gate doesn't work, warning lights randomly go on and off).
It is both inconvenient and frustrating to take the car in for repairs all of the time.
My last straw - last time I took it in, I returned to find the dealership showing my car to prospective customers (literally sitting in my car with my personal belongings on display).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our lease came due on our Prius and Toyota did not have product so we went looking and were surprised by the options we had.

We drove the C-MAX and were quite surprised by it's features and performance.
 Overall it is 5 stars.

On the test drive we put it thru its paces, rather harshly [I think to the salespersons surprise] but there was not a thing we could find fault with.

If I had to list a deficiency, I'd have to list the SYNC system.
 Like all Microsoft products, it is better on the drawing board.

A proper manual [digital would be good] of all the commands and how they fit together would be good.
