I really enjoyed driving my 2013 Passat diesel but the turbo charger failed on it with 32K miles on it.
We live in a rural area (sparsely populated/closest dealer is 1-1/2 hours away) and I have been talking to owners in the area and two others have had the same problem.
This is my first VW and I am getting very concerned.
I have had three Honda's and have not had any problems.
Am thinking of trading off.

Unlike the majority of females, I like to "drive" a car. I haven't owned anything that doesn't have a stick in 25 years, with the exception of a brief mind lapse with a Honda Pilot. We special ordered my Passat TDI with a 6 speed manual transmission.I've driven it 85k miles in 2 years. The only two things I like about this car is the cabin room, and the excellent mileage. The back seat space comfortable suits my 6'1" and 5'11" teenagers, and my 8 year old. The turbo lags, there aren't ample charging ports, no memory seats, HATE the stereo touch screen, cheap mirror control, needs a sensor light for re-gen. and on and on. Inside is cheaply made. Exterior is frumpy.

I was skeptical at first when
I test drove the Passat TDI. BMW/Audi/Mercedes all offer diesels, but not one of them will mate it to a manual transmission (at least here in the colonies). That is a key selling point to me, so VW won my bid. I do get people telling me to check on my engine, because it sounds a little rough, then I tell them its a diesel, its supposed to sound like that, then they go in for a closer inspection and see the stick and generally get surprised. The cabin does tend to get a little loud on the freeway, the bluetooth is iffy, at best and I can't have a sunroof with a manual trans. Small price to pay for that gas milage, so I don't really complain much

This car made me a believer in diesel. All that torque makes it feel like a much beefier motor than the 140HP rating would have you believe.
When I purchased it I was driving nearly 80 mpd 80/20 hwy/city and averaging over 46 (set my cruise on 67 on the highway, but can't keep my foot out of the boost city).
My job now has me driving 80-90% city and am averaging about 37-40 or around 700 miles per tank.
27K on it now.
I have personally gotten 1039 miles on a tank in this car.
I drove it from LaPlace, LA (just N or New Orleans) to the shore of Lake Michigan in Chicago then another 150 or so miles into N. Indiana.
Filled up and still had almost a gallon left, 59.2MPG (hand calculated).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I picked up my Passat TDI 6-speed manual a couple days ago from a dealer in Phoenix.
Drove it home to Los Angeles.
That's 390 miles.
When I got home, the "Remaining Range" on the tank showed 510 miles!
Normally you associate 45-50 mpg with an econobox, or a hybrid.
Not so here.
This is a large, comfortable car.
Yeah, there is a bit more noise at idle, which disappears when you rev it a bit.
On the road, almost impossible to tell from gasoline power.
Engine has plenty of torque, and cruises effortlessly at speed.
If you remember the noise, vibration and smokey diesels of the 1970s and 1980s, they've come a long way since then.

This is absolutely the best car you can get for your money! I'm a car nut having had a Car and Driver subscription since I was 15. I've owned several high end cars such as Porsche BMW Lexus and Audi
I took a new job with a commute averaging 100 miles per day.
I researched green cars for months and nothing compares to this vehicle, especially with the manual transmission, which transforms it into a true sport sedan. The manual transmission is smooth, effortless and precise. Gives you immediate power without the delay of the awkward automated manual (test drove both and there is no comparison). It's a must if you like having a little fun behind the wheel. The interior quality is outstanding.

Purchased the car about 2 months ago. Continue to enjoy this very efficient VW. With 80% highway driving, mpg is consistently in the range of 47-52mpg. Interior has loads of room.

This is a spacious, perhaps bit too large, wonderful to drive cruising car.
The mpg is remarkable given it size, and the 6 speed is smooth and fun, fuel efficient and serves to keep me alert and paying attention to driving.
I owned a 2011 TDi sport wagon and loved it but thought because i often drive long distances I would enjoy a bit bigger car.
This 111 wheelbase is maybe a touch more that I wanted but I get out of it after 500 miles and feel great and not cramped like i would at the end of a long ride in a smaller car. I am 6' and 70+ years old
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I purchased this car to be my daily drive on my 100 mile daily commute. Running at 70 mph, I can get over 50 MPG in this car all day long! 

The car is amazingly quiet, comfortable, and nimble. I am enjoying the 6 speed manual immensley. The low end power provided by the diesel is amazing and really fun to drive (which was not expected in a diesel) 

The car feels like a much more expensive car on the road and you could litteraly hear a pin drop at 70 mph. The build quality is wonderful and best of all the car is built right here in the USA! 

Way to go VW, I hope many more people put this one on thier list!
