I have a 2014 EX-L Accord that 15 years ago would have been pure fantasy (esp,, the gas mileage, engine technology, etc). I just don't see where you can nit-pick too much an a car that was built with the minds of a likely very anal retentive group of designers. Here are a few sill examples: 1) On the shift handle, the button you depress initially felt kinda chintzy; however, over time you realize the lightness of design makes it just a little bit easier to depress - it almost floats. I think this design esthetic pervades the car. It seems like everything works very well.
