Purchased new 2014 Escape 2 months ago (3100 miles now).  Have had to take for service several times.  A clear lemon with numerous issues: poor gas mileage (best 21 MPG Â advertised 22mpg city, 30mpg highway), Continual AC problems freezing up and now intermittent (dealer says Ford knows of problem with no fix yet), intermittent chemical smell, grinding steering column (dealer says others do same), Slipping transmission bang (dealer can't duplicate), wiper squeaks and jumps (4 service visits no fix), sticking seat belt replaced, radio screen won't reset (dealer says same on others).  We've requested a buyback and are waiting.

This is a fun vehicle to drive and nice to look at plus we get lots of compliments. Then there is the MPG which is not as good as rated and the fuel range also seems less than the 15.1 gallon tank should indicate.
I am hoping more owners will bring these concern up to Ford and have them addressed........
