We bought this brand new after loving our test drive.
After a year, the handling is excellent.
It is fun to drive...tight steering and great visibility.
Road noise is fair but a bit loud.
Cons include the front seat arm rests, they are very small and rather uncomfortable.
Anyone over 5' 10" will be kind of cramped.
Also the stereo knob is very slippery to grip...silly I know but annoying. The temperature and fan knob settings are all on a very small display on the dash...hard to read.
So my minor gripes may be picky but my humble opinion.
Still very happy with the overall ride and versatility of this small minivan!!
