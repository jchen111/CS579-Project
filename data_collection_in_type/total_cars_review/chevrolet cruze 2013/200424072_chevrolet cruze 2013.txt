Overall, the Cruze is a awesome commuter vehicle. I wish it had a little more torque on the freeway but I guess I can't expect much with a 4 cylinder vehicle. Minor issues with rear brake noise. Sun-visor coming apart where mirror folds. Satisfied with performance and look of vehicle.

My car is a 2013 chevy cruze lt. I bought it 8/14/13 and it has been in the shop 7 times since I bought it. I had a water leak on the drivers side, the heater makes a weird grinding noise and the transmission surges, it also make a weird scraping noise when I put my foot on the gas. I finally had enough and called GM my car has 3,000 miles on it and has spent more time at the shop than my driveway. It has now been 8 days since I have had my car they have me in a rental until the paperwork is finalized on my new 2014 replacement cruze. I am so glad that they pulled me from my car it has cost me time from work and so frustrating.....

Don't know if i got a bad one but bought my Chevy Cruze in May 2013 a month later had to have a new bumper put on noticed the other one popped apart from the frame, speaker had to be replaced, car started leaking under the dash onto the carpet when it would rain had to have a header put on, break light in rear window is very dirty and claim this is normal, rear bow tie popped off at the top had to be replaced and yes when i come to a stop my car jerks too. I don't like that the windshield wiper dispenser won't work when it is very cold outside but i guess that is expected. No light in the glove compartment. And sometimes there is a odor when you have the heat on.

The Cruze is a nice, solid car for a great price. I like the exterior styling, and also the simplicity and layout of the interior.
The driver has excellent visibility.
The key selling feature for me was the top safety ratings, as my daughters would be spending a lot of time driving this car too.

The car (1LT, 1.4Turbo) handles competently, and the engine has surprising strength given the fantastic gas mileage.
We've had it for 4 months & 4K miles, and so far no issues.
The transmission and controls all work perfectly.
I was initially looking for a good used car, and also looked at new Civics & Corollas, but I liked the Cruze the best and am happy to buy an American brand.

We developed spots on the hood where the paint peeled away.
We've been to the Chevy dealer and spoke to Chevy corporate.
They concluded it was bird poop that caused the paint chips but refused to fix the problem, informing us it will cost $500 to fix.
Our actual 25 MPG is also very disappointing and not what we expected.
In the year we've had the car, there have been 2 recalls on safety issues.
If I had known about these issues, I would not have purchased the car and I warn others to be careful.
It's extremely disappointing that Chevy won't stand behind the quality of its cars.
Will never purchase another Chevy.

I have had the 2013 Cruze LT for month now, have driven over 2,000 mi. Some things that I have to nitpic are. The seats are hard and uncomfortable. I get lower back pain. I have tried all kinds of adjustments to no avail. I had to add a cushion
to help in comfort. I have a problem that service can not find cause. The dash lights and 7" screen will go out for about 30 to 40 seconds and then come back on. It does this once in awhile.
The door locks are on the console and not door which is weird. No inside trunk release, cup holders seem to low and very hard to find in the dark due to no lighting in that area. Armrest is to short.
Back seating is a joke.
Other than that car runs well.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numerous problems as others have mentioned.
 Hesitant, jerky transmission that never shifts when you need it, like merging, lane changing, or accelerating after a turn.
Transmission bucks while cruising at constant speeds.
Car occasionally lurches forward, or hops with the brake pedal fully pressed.
 Steering wheel is off-center and car pulls to one side.
Thinly padded seats offer no thigh or back support. Rear seats are even more uncomfortable and very cramped.
MyLink randomly restarts and drops Bluetooth connections frequently, and radio reception is spotty. Sub-par 25 MPG in city driving.
Steering wheel obstructs view of gauges. Bad blind spots.
This will be my last GM vehicle.

Bought the car about 2 weeks ago and couldn't be happier. I am a big gear head and based aspects other than price and reliability. The cruze ranks among the best when it comes to handling and the feel of the drive. Only the focus and mazda3 rank higher. I chose the cruze due to is executive good looks, upscale interior, german like build quality, and peppy turbo engine.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to downsize to a car that could let me cope with $4.00+ per gallon gas, yet could take me on extended trips in comfort.
The Cruze has so far fit my requirements.
I have been reading reviews from car magazines and web sites that complain of shift points on the automatic and the overall lack of power.
I disagree.
I find that the automatic shifts/downshifts as it should and am beginning to believe that the 1.4L turbo horsepower numbers are under-reported by GM.
This engine loves to race to the redline, and I have never been concerned when merging into freeway trafic.
The suspension is on the taught side, but handling is great.

I have the same issues, car lunges forward, motor shakes badly, My Link radio system freezes, sometimes tranny wont shift properly, Now my car wont come out of or go into park like it did, it took me 15 minutes to put it into park at work. I have only 860 miles on it.... still smells new, so upsetting, not what you want from a new car, I bought a new car so i didnt have to deal with used car problems..
