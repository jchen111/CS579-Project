This car is built very well and has a long list of features.
Chevy has done a great job of creating a diverse lineup for the Cruze.
The MyLink features link Pandora, navigation, XM, etc... are easy to use and the screen position, size, and clarity are excellent!
Driving the Cruze is fun and for a change, I am looking forward to my next road trip.
The trunk is huge for a small car, but the back seat room is a bit tight for 6' adults.
If you are 5'10" or shorter it would be fine!
