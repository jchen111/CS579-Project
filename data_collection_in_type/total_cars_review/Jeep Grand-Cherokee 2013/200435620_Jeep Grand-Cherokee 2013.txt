Picked up a JGC Overland Summit edition just last week.
This is probably one of the best SUVs for the price in it's class.
The Overland Summit trim level is fully loaded with all kinds of technology and features and competes with the likes of the BMW X5, Merc M class, and the Audi Q7 all for several thousands less.


The fit and finish both inside and out is perfect, the ride quality is great especially with the quadra lift air suspension,
the tech inside competes with the luxury foreign brands although the UConnect interface does look a bit date but very easy to use.

The 5.7L V8 engine has plenty of power for this beast but is very thirsty and I'm only averaging about 13.8 MPG.

Well, I have owned my Jepp Overland for 5 days now and the dealer has had it for 4 of the 5 days.
The Jeep was delivered from the factory without a transmission line attached so it blew out the trans.
I love the Jeep, I love the design and the look, but reliability is an issue.
This all happened in the first 250 miles. Working with Jeep to resolve the issue.
It will require a new trans. so I now appear to have a used Cherokee with 250 mile and a replacement trans. Anyone want to buy it for what I just paid?
