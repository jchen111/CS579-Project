I have always loved the Jeep and when I got the car it was really great. I am so disappointed at how fast the decline has been from really really good to a very worrying point. At this moment it takes an average of 2 minutes to start the car, once it has gone to more than 6 minutes. It just cranks and dies. It also has strange vacuum and knocking noises from the engine bay. This is from a pampered car, never maxed my Jeep. Yet this happens, why? So very sad.
