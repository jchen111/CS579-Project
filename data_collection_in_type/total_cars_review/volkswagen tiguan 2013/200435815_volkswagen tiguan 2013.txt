I live in 4 seasons country and I have now converted to 4motion as a way of life.
Driving to work everyday on poorly plowed roads allows me to do circles around other SUVs and I pushed my car hard to get to work on time and have yet to spin out.
I am not a professional driver but I have driven a lot across the country many times and my car has yet to fail, sputter, or slight in any form of performance.
She takes what gets thrown at her with a determined grin.

The turbo-charged engine makes easy work of green lights and passing cars on the freeway.
Mileage has been about 24/25mpg steadily and I have yet to have a major repair going on 1.5 years/ 11000+ miles.
Miles are too easy.

My fiance wanted an SUV via a lease, I wanted a CC.
Knowing we couldn't afford both, the Tiguan was the perfect domestic compromise.

I've seen in many reviews how the Tiguan is a poor value and I absolutely disagree.
We wanted AWD, Sunroof, Bluetooth, a peppy engine, fuel efficiency, and a reasonable payment.
The Tiguan S delivered on all these save fuel efficiency (20/26 awd is passable and not a deal-breaker).
The SEL may have a bloated price, but the base S is definitely a good value.

The Tiguan's 2.0 TSI is a great engine.
The car feels sporty but also compliant over rough roads.

The cargo room leaves much to be desired, but living in the city the maneuverability is quite welcome
