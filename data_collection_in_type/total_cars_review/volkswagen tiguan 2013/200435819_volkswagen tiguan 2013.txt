The interior is very comfortable with great features.
Performance lags -- down right awful on hot summer day w/AC on.
Not only does it guzzle down a lot more gas - expensive premium gas I may add but it becomes erratic when idling or in traffic.
Try taking your foot off the brake when in traffic with the ac on and watch your car lurch forward without giving it gas.
Not to mention the sound it makes while your foot is on the brake while the engine sounds like a helicopter hovering overhead.
