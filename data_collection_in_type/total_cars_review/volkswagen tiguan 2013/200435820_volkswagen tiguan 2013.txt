This is my third and favorite Volkswagen.
My first was a '95 Jetta, then a '07 4Motion Passat Wagon, and now this 2013 Tiguan. The interior is well laid out and comfy. The giant sunroof is just cool. 
This small crossover SUV has some trade-offs with my previous wagon.
It's tallness makes it easier to maneuver in the city, but it's smallness means it doesn't feel as solid and smooth over the studded tire ruts on the freeway. 
After two longer highway trips I'm used to it and wouldn't go back. 
The transmission holds a low gear when you crest steep hills.
It's a little noisy and strange at first, but works well to keep the car from accelerating rapidly at the crest of the hill.
