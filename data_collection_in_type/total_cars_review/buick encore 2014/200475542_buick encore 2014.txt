We purchased our Encore brand new. After an initial "honeymoon period", we started having reliability issues. The car has now been repaired three times for suspension noise. 
It has gotten so bad that the Dealer & GM proposed a "Trade Assist" as they suggested we get rid of the car. Unfortunately the assistance wasn't much. 
We are very dissatisfied - we have spend endless time on the phone with GM and at the Dealer.
I would highly recommend you consider another manufacturer!

We have had our encore for a bit over a month.
We are pleased with everything except the navigation.
Worst GPS routing I have ever used.
On a five hour trip -- using side by side with our portable TomTom the buick system routed us 30 miles farther and 1 hour longer.
We do not trust the navigation at all.
It can not find addresses our TomTom has and it routinely routes a longer distance or time.
We will not use it for anything other than finding an address in town -- if it even can find the address.
Do not waste your money on the navigation system.
Spend $100 on a portable instead of $800 for the car system.
