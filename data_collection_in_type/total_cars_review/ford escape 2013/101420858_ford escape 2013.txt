I recently bought a 2013 Escape SEL with 13,900 miles on it. We have only had it for a week, so I don't have a lot of experience with it yet. But, the time I have had driving it has been rewarding. Compared to the archaic, Jeep Cherokee Limited which it replaced, it is a little larger, yet drives like a sports car.


The 1.6 liter EcoBoost is powerful and responsive. The handling of this little SUV is really nice, the steering is quick and extremely responsive while the suspension provides a firm, nimble ride. The brakes are very good, although touchy - requiring a light, controlled foot. Our average gas mileage, for mixed city-highway is 26MPG, but includes 2 70 mile trips.

First thing i would like to say is I'm a Nissan car salesman. I have no bias with domestic vehicles. The escape rides beautifully. I drove a rental from Atlanta, Ga to Green Bay, Wi through a major storm. No problems at all. The seats are the problem. Nissan has the zero gravity seats which are 100% more comfortable than the Ford seat. The engine and transmission work together just fine. Great visibility

I have a 2.0 SEL AWD Escape bought last May. I've put on 5000 miles so far and I'm really pleased with it for many reasons.

First of all, it's is really well made. The interior is high quality and really comfortable (I'm 6'2"... not all cars work for me). I liked the build quality much more than the CX-5.

It's a blast to drive, it puts a grin on my face every day. It tracks true and is very sure on all sorts of conditions.
I hardly can wait to try it in the snow!

My gas milage averages around high 26mpg in mixed driving and 29 highway.
With 2 kayaks this drops way down to 23-24mpg.

Just purchased my Escape 2 weeks ago, and very happy with it. I bought it with 110 miles on it, and currently already have over 600. I am currently getting about 23.4 miles to the gallon, and hope to see it get higher, but already an improvement over what I traded in.

We bought our 2013 Escape last July, loved the the look of it, loved the interior and was hoping for great gas mileage with the EcoBoost engine...
Well after two weeks it was recalled for engine fires. Ford had it for a week... Then at Thanksgiving it was recalled again...this time Ford had it for a month... Same issue..
In addition I think the engine, 1.6, is too small for the vehicle, the stated 22 mpg city is way way off... I am lucky if I get 16-17 locally. All I drive is local, we commute 13 miles each way through NYC, I was hoping the EcoBoost engine would be ideal... Boy was/am I surprised..
We have applied for Lemon Law and Ford will repurchase it soon.

After having 4 Honda CRVs in a row I got very bored and decided it was time for a change.
I had seen newspaper articles and tv ads about how Ford was really coming around and producing a better product so I decided to give Ford a chance and go American!
Wow was I wrong.
The car was in the shop less than a week after I bought it and then back in again 3 days later.
I have had issues with the sunroof rattling annoyingly.
The door lock not functioning properly and the Sync system has major flaws including not recognizing major Roads!!!
Never in my life have I ever had an issue with any Honda ever. Ford is not ready I really made a mistake I feel like I bought a used car

Just bought this car, has under 200 miles on it. Opted for the tow package with the 2.0 liter engine. Smaller than the mid-size SUV that I traded in but I love the handling and extra horsepower of the 2 liter engine. If you have a big family this car may NOT be for you. Skip the pricy options such as Nav, Park Assist, Back Up sensors, BLIS, Cross Traffic, and Power Lift Gate. Dealer included installation of the roof rack in the price. This car has many of the luxury items that my wife's new Volvo S80 has. I guess Ford learned something when they owned Volvo way back when. Highly recommend this car.

I have owned a 2013 Ford Escape SEL AWD with the 2.0L engine for nearly three months and have driven it for about 4,300 miles.
I have had multiple issues with the vehicle since the day of delivery. 

We chose this vehicle over several others based on reviews, the perception that Ford has turned the corner on quality and seeing at an auto show. We ordered it before any were available for a test drive. Sadly, a potentially great vehicle has been one bad experience after another.
