I drive a Ford Fusion Energi as a commuter car.
I drive 16 miles each way in stop and go traffic on surface streets and freeway.
I live in a hilly area.
Going to work I drive all electric with brake regen down hills.
It is very quiet. I don't charge up at work.
About half way home it switches over to hybrid mode.
After a month of driving 865 miles the dashboard says my avg is 90.4 mpge (less if climate on)
I charge it up nightly in my garage using a 110 volt charger. The Adaptive Cruise Control reduces commuter stress. The Sony stereo sounds good using Sirrus or streaming music via bluetooth phone using Spotify.
I am enjoying my new tech car. My commute costs are much less.

It's rare to come across a plugin hybrid vehicle that has the three main components to making a great car; looks, fuel efficiency and fun to drive. This car has it all. I've owned the car for just over a month now, have driven 900 miles and have yet to put in my first tank of gas since the dealership filled it for me at sale. How can you argue with that? I plug it in every night using a standard household outlet and that charge alone gets me to work in the morning and almost all the way home at night. The touch screen display is vibrant and easy to use. The dashboard can be configured to several different looks depending on what information you want to display.
