I usually by new Toyota, this time i decided to try the Honda CRV. I am very disappointed with the quality.  the car has only 3000 miles and the ceiling is falling apart, coming off, the dealer won't replace the car, promised repair and Honda customer service were not helpful, did not care , said they will document it?? I asked for a manager but to my surprise no one was available? Yes that was Honda customer service in USA??? ManI should not go to Honda , I should have stayed with Toyota, never had issues and their customer service are much better.The quality and price were very good too.

I was originally looking for a small truck to replace my 2000 Xterra. But the gas mileage was not to my liking. I them started looking at some of the smaller SUV' s I settled on the Honda CRV for my needs. I pull a small utility trailer for my business and never pull more than 1000 lbs. The 2.4 liter engine is powerful enough for my needs, I still can get over 30 mpg pulling my small
trailer. I just finished taking a 1200 mile road trip.
And using the ecomode got 34.9 mpg. Ride quality, handling and comfort were great.

I bought the Honda CRV 2014 model. It gives a good gas mileage. After driving for 6 months here are my griefs about it.
1) The driver seat loses its height on its own. I have to pump it up every week. I consulted the dealership and they said that the mechanism is not broken - as the seat does go up & down on the push of the lever. And there is nothing they can do.
2) I get a low frequency humming sound some where from the rear of the vehile. It happened every time during the winter when I cold start the engine & am driving in the parking lot. After 5
minutes of driving it never happens again. Not noticing it in anymore as the weather has become warm now.

I was excited on purchasing a brand new CRV, but the short test drive did not reveal this crossovers shortcomings. After a month and 2K miles, below are my observations:
1)	Harsh/bumpy ride - you feel each and every road crack, unless the road is not freshly laid, the ride is tiresome
2)	Too much windnoise - went to the dealer twice, but they mentioned that it is the characteristic of the vehicle. The door seals/insulation is not very good
3)	Too much road noise on certain road surfaces
4)	The stereo is a joke, my 15 year old second car has better sounding stereo and speakers
5)	Seats are not comfortable - lack of thigh support on rear bench and front seat headrests tilt way too forward

I leased my vehicle on October 11, 2013.
My vehicle has almost 2000 miles. I have been leasing Honda vehicles for over 10 years and this is my first SUV.
The ride is smooth and the road noise is low.
When you need that extra pick up when entering a highway it responds well.
The fabric seats are comfortable and my family say the back seats are comfortable too.
The interior menu display screen is small.
The trunk space is good.
Overall I am very happy with my Honda CR-V.
