Went from an 08 Odyssey LX to the CRV EX. This is my 3rd Honda. I've always loved how Honda engines rev up so smoothly. This one is great, and shifts quickly.
 It's ride is firm, but normal for an SUV. Lots of storage in back, and plenty of leg room for all.

Had a lease-up on a Rav4, which had the rare 3rd row that I found useful.
I was reluctant to give that up but
excited to try the Honda with many friends loving their Odysseys, CRVs, etc. I absolutely LOVED the car (had it 3 wks), but I was shocked(and terrified) last night when I was heading home on somewhat rural drive in a pretty bad storm. The headlights are inadequate at best in that sitch. Rain was heavy and roads were dark but it was far from the worst storm I have driven in.
Low beam illum. was poor and the brights did nothing but point straight
at the rain and reflect back.
Never a problem in the Toyota.Researched when I got home and see it's widely reported.Much loved otherwise

After driving an Integra for 12 years, it's quite an adjustment switching to an SUV. 

The back up camera in en excellent tool, but should not be used exclusively when in reverse - there's still no substitute for looking out that back. 

The city gas mileage is way lower than I expected: 16 mpg is the highest I've gotten and this is driving with conserving gas in mind.
Highway is more acceptable at 26 mpg.

I got this in the winter time and it is colder than usual. The heater in the CR-V takes several minutes to get going and provide heat. Just as I start to feel comfortable, I have arrived at my destination (work commute is less than 15 minutes.)

Purchased this late November 2013 and have put a little less than 1,000 miles on it so far.
Very happy with it so far, except for the gas mileage is below 20 mpg even with the eco button turned on, although almost all my driving so far have been on distances of less than 5 miles... mostly 2-3 miles.
Features I enjoy the most is the USB and Bluetooth connectivity.
When you hook your I phone to the USB port, Pandora can be fully controlled with the car's audio system controls, including channel.
The backup camera is convenient too!

Ive had my new '14CR-V for a couple of weeks now and put just over a thousand miles on it, a mix of in city and highway.
Driving a Camry Hybrid for more than 7 years, I loved the gas mileage, but there was a lack of cargo space in the small truck. 
So rather than get a somewhat more spacious sedan I thought Id try out an economical SUV with tons more cargo space for my stuff, and trips to the beach, while not sacrificing people space when my family comes visiting.
Cargo space is abundant in this airy, fun to drive car. It's easy to fold the 40/60 rear seats down with a simple pull of a lever. 
Mileage range is 22 to 34.8, avg 28.7 MPG. This is an all round great Compact Useful Vehicle!
