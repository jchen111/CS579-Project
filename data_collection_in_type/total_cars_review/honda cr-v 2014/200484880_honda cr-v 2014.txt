I traded my 2008 CRV in for a 2014 CRV.
I had looked at the Ford Escape, Hyundai Santa Fe, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Subaru Forester, but felt that the CRV was the best overall SUV for me.
Another big factor in my decision was the excellent service that I have experienced at the local Honda dealer.
I was disappointed in the choice of exterior colors (mostly dark shades) and very limited choice of interior colors.
On our first long trip we averaged 28-29 mpg.
I'm hoping that will improve to 30-31 mpg which I got on my 2008 CRV. One minor annoying issue was the same weak, whimpy horns that I had on my 2008.
For $100, I had Honda upgrade my horns to the louder, stronger Honda Accord horns.

We've had this for over 6 months and 5000+ miles,
It replaced an older Honda Crosstour - glad we did.
The CRV is comfortable, highly maneuverable and very economical for an AWD.
The controls are easy to use.
We would consider buying this car again if we were in the market.

I just bought the car a little over a week ago.
Before purchasing I had narrowed down my search to Toyota, Mazda and Honda. I chose the Honda because I really liked the roomy interior and it was fun to drive. The gas mileage was also a deciding factor, although all three car makers were very close in that category. I also chose the Honda for its reliability and resale value.

My first CRV was a 2005 with 120,000 miles and other than routine maintenance the only extra cost involved was a single rear caliper repair. LOVED it! Totally reliable vehicle that never let me down. Test drove a 2014 EX-L and was amazed with the comfort and handling. The interior is open and comfortable. Love shifter location, more room up front than the Rogue and Rav4. Headlights are def not as bright as my 2005 but that's a positive for me...was tired of drivers flashing their lights at me assuming I had my high beams on when I didn't. The fog lights do help to illuminate the road well when using low beams though. VERY pleased with my newest CRV :)

Our 2014 CRV is a very nice, reliable and economical car. We have had a number of Hondas and find them to be a good value.
The CRV has excellent seat comfort and seating position, great visibility, good ride and handles well ... as long as you don't drive aggressively.
The sills are low - a good thing for over 60's getting in and out.
It has a real key - not a fob and starter button, a good thing.
We just did a 1400 mile trip and got great highway mileage (33+). As with all Hondas, there are minor annoyances that mar an otherwise great car. We considered similar Toyota, Mazda and Subaru models and liked the CRV best overall. There are issues (see below), but all cars have issues.
