Bought one early, August 2012. LS Manual hatchback. Installed window rain guards, colored side moldings (factory), after market mudflaps, and a light duty trailer hitch to tow a small three rail motorcycle trailer to rides and races. Driving gently and hauling the trailer approx 7,000 miles of the 28,000 that the car had when totaled, was averaging 38.9mpg. Car was cheap to buy, cheap to operate, handled well. Hit a deer at approx 35mph. Locked seat belts, drove radiator back into the exhaust manifold, broke a headlight, kinked hood, kinked right fender. Didn't set air bags off. Some concern for safety, but had the deer contacted the bumper, wouldn't have been as bad. Looking at another one.

It's a mini car with 84 hpw...I lOVE my SPARK. I don't expect to get there fast- but my brand new car get's me there. No more worrying about my old Hyundai breaking down on me.

I can be really happy and satisfied with this car if General Motors fixes the A/C issues that some of them are having.
The A/C works while driving, but blows warm air at idle.
I do not enjoy driving this car in the city at this time.
I love the styling and charm of the design of the car.
It is fun to drive and handles longer trips really well, in my opinion.
The colors that are available gives this car its unique place in my day to day travels.
I will update this review and mark this car with higher scores once General Motors finds a resolution for the A/C problems.
I have the LS model with the 5-speed transmission.
It is Jalapeno Green.

After looking at used car and new cars in the small car segment, I pick the Spark after the test drive. The interior room in the quality of build at this price was impressive. I have 2800 miles on my Spark and am really happy with my purchase.
