I switched from '13 to '14 model for several reasons below: added blind spot monitoring, heated seats, remote starter in harsh winters.

This car absolutely rocks. First thing I noticed the steering is now more precise and firm. A rearview camera has obviously been improved as images look much crispier.

For me, the biggest complaint for the '13 model was a late shift from 3rd to 4th gear and back while in stop and go traffic which felt like a delayed acceleration. I drove several of these having the same issue. This is no longer the case, so obviously the engineers have made software adjustments and it now drives perfect.

Drove the Odyssey, Sienna and Quest.
The Chrysler T&C is the best of the bunch and the best value available. 

We had been looking for a while and finally narrowed it down to the Nissan Quest and Chrysler T&C.
Took two test drives in both.

Chrysler was so much
better looking than the Quest is the ugliest minivan out there.
I really could not get past that. 

Finally rented a T&C for a 150 mile day trip.
The van averaged over 30 MPG.
Although the rental was a 2014, it had over 30,000 miles and it still felt, drove and sounded like brand new.
That did it for me.

We bought a Chrysler Town & Country the next day and paid $3,000 less than a comparably equipped Nissan.
