Doing as much research as possible on the current market led me to the CX-5.
A long term RAV4 owner with friends who drive Subarus provided some first hand insight on my most likely competitor candidates.
 Yet a test drive--along with some nudging from style--made the decision an easy one.
I settled on a Touring AWD with Sunroof and Bose.
So far I'm pleased with the driving experience, style, value and comfort.
Any negatives?
Yes, for a dozen reasons, I wish I did NOT purchase the Bose audio system.
 What a waste of $ not to mention effort I'll expend to replace it with something less annoying.

Overall car is good, BUT, tire pressure light keeps coming on. Dealer has reset it, comes back on in less than 10 miles, dealer resets again and stays off for a month, back on again. I have done this dance 4+ times and is on again! No the tires are not low, no I have not pushed the reset button. I think this is a defect.

I own a CX5 AWD with a hitch. I have reviewed this car when it was new and I am now reviewing it after one years worth of driving.
The most impressive feature for me is the outstanding gas mileage in this car. I recently hyper- tested my mileage for about 100 miles over flat and/or gently rolling country roads with a fair amount of traffic and squeezed about 40 MPG from the car. I average 35mpg normally. The info gauge seemed slightly generous with a reading of about 45mpg. I set the info gauge to averaging mode which is a little confusing as to how it calculates it's figure but I'm not complaining too much. The handling is outstanding although over bumpy road conditions it is a bit harsh.

I purchased my zeal red 2013 Mazda CX-5 in AWD touring package in January 2013. I absolutely love this vehicle! This is my 3rd Mazda. My first was a 2004 3 touring (GS), and the second was a 2007 3 GT Sport hatch. I purchased the CX-5 because I wanted an awd vehicle with good fuel economy. The exterior is beautiful, interior is simple, yet clean and easy to look at. Fuel economy is wonderful (actually better than my Mazda 3GT was!) I have no complaints about this purchase. Yes it is slightly underpowered, but I only notice that while merging onto the highway. I almost bought a CX-7 I test drove a few months prior to this and WOW am I ever glad I didn't.

I bought my CX-5 in july, I have over 7,000 miles on it already and it has not made one peep. I drive it like a maniac in a mountainous area and still get average of 26 mpg, which is more than the computer calculated mpg. 
I just put it through a dangerous off-road test and it performed admirably. Two and a half inches of snow over grass and frozen mud, it drove through it like on asphalt on a hot summer day. I have done 125 miles per hour on the highway. I have not seen any reason to miss my V-6 turbocharged car, sure it does not take off on the line but it is not a race car, it still beats most vehicles. The transmission is the best I have seen outside of a Porsche.

Just purchased a CX-5 Touring 2 weeks ago. So far so good. It rides well. I'm getting over 26MPG with city and freeway driving. The blue tooth/touch screen stereo system is great. Very intuitive. All the controls in the interior are intuitive. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.
Some things to consider:
1. The headrests are very far forward and can be and uncomfortable neck position for some.
2. Blind Side Monitoring can take some getting used to.
3. Very new vehicle so there aren't many accessories available yet.

We have had our pearl white CX-5 now for 7 weeks and could not be happier with the purchase. Mazda build quality is everywhere along with great handling. No..it's not a power house but not under powered and @ $4.00 a gal for fuel that's ok with us. It is just fine the way it is and do not understand some of the talk of lack of power..it zips right along! The rear back-up camera is great to have..Bose sound system rocks and so far fuel economy with very little highway is 29.5 Mpg...grab one..not the Chevy or the Ford!

Purchased this shortly after they arrived in US.
Decided on Mazda over CRV to be different.
Also like BSM and that the better radio/speakers can be added to the mid level Touring model.
Wife is primary driver and she is getting about 26.5 MPG w/ 30 mile city daily commute.
Also very comfortable on highway.
Noise level is very acceptable.
Now that my wife has driven this a lot she likes it more and more compared to 2001 Town & Country which was actually a very quiet and competant driving vehicle.

Last year I bought my wife a Mazda 3 and she and I both love it. So, while gettting an oil change I saw the advertisement for the CX-5. I had a Nissan truck that I really liked but I was getting 14MPG. I traded the truck in and immediately took the CX-5 to San Antonio from Denver. I had 3 passengers and lots of luggage. It was the most comfortable ride of any car/suv that I have owned. I calculated that I got 31 MPG with the weight of my passengers and baggage. The vehicle handles very well. I find that it has, what feels like low torque on the low end but, I drive by gas pumps all day long.

We just picked up the skyblue CX-5 i Touring with the Bose/moonroof package and I must say, it's an impressive car. Very roomy, drives very well for a crossover (not mushy around the corners) and while it could have more ooomph, it's fast enough for most day to day driving. Very comfortable and roomy, in fact the first thing we did with it was buy a new dresser from Ikea.

Car is too new to speak towards MPG yet, but the wife is happy, so I'm happy.
