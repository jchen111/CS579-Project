We got this car on a whim, and have not looked back since.
It is as perfect a car as we have ever owned.
There is nothing about this car that we don't like.
Visibility and ground clearance, with seating height and ability to see top the list.
Headlights and standard fog lights only make it better.
Add in all wheel drive, and standard features like a back up camera, HD radio, plenty of people space, leather seats, etc. and you will fall in love with this car.
It is big enough and not too big.
The MPG after only 500 miles is running 25MPG.
I'm sure this will improve as time goes on.
But even at 25, it is more than our smaller suv we traded in for this car.
You will love this car.

For the last 10 years, I've had various turbocharged vehicles, some of which were modded.
I grew tired of temperamental turbos, having too much power in slow traffic, and spending ungodly sums of cash fueling them up.
 

I just needed a reliable AWD vehicle that can get me around in the mountains throughout the winter months, ground clearance,
get good fuel economy, and can stand up to my outdoorsy lifestyle.

So far, I have 1000 miles and have been very impressed with this vehicle.
I find it very peppy, and find the 145 hp rating deceiving.
This climbs up mountain roads feeling sprightly, and never gives even a hint of losing steam.
At 75 mph, I get about 30-32 mpg.
 Love it.

Lots of "compact" SUVs out there, and almost all of them are boring and bland.
While no drag racer, this car is fun to drive, has exciting styling, and is just the right size.
Also, it has a unique look and size that isn't quite an SUV, more like a sports wagon/SUV cross.

You get a lot for the money - heated leather seats, Navigation, moonroof, backup camera - compared to other cars.
Plus, the raised clearance, cool wheels, and great gas mileage (at at 27 MPG mostly on short trips and city driving).
The drive feels very secure, and the shift paddles are fun to use.
The engine does rev high and won't get you 0 - 60 in a record time, but the car feels punchy, spry, and turns on a dime.
