I bought my Subaru CrossTrek about a month ago. I fell in love with this car at first glance as I was already looking to buy a Subaru (possibly an Impreza). So when I saw an "Impreza on steroids", it was kind of a no-brainer. So far I like almost everything about the car. I'm not too impressed with the gas mileage. I average 25 MPG but I figure that's not too bad for an AWD. My major complaint
is that the radio seems to be outdated in this car as it is not compatible with any of the I-Phones (even my already outdated 4S). I've rented 2012 and 2013 cars and have always been able to control my I-Phone through the USB port but it's not gonna' happen in this car. Very disappointed.
