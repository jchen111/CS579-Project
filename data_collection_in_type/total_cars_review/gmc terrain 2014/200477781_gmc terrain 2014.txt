We choose the Terrain as an alternative to another family sedan to seat 5 comfortably. It achieves that goal. It also appealed to our need for more utility in terms of rear space for kid activities (soccer) and the towing package to handle a bike rack and other rack like extensions (basket). The vehicle is quiet, comfortable, powerful (we have the V6 - don't get sucked into the 4 cyl), and packed with features.

I have a 2014 GMC Terrain Denali, V6, AWD.
Thought I'd give the American built a try again after years of foreign quality.
This new vehicle has 443 miles on it and the AWD system has failed and I have to wait 2 days to get it to the dealership.
Unbelievable.
Plus the American Car arrogance when I expressed my disappointment at the dealership of a new vehicle having this type of failure (during a winter snow storm) said "That's why we offer a warranty so we can fix things".


Wow, what arrogance and audacity about your product.

Although it said I should get 16 MPG city, I'm lucky to pull 12 on Premium fuel.

Never Buy American Again!
