I have owed the 2013 RAV4 since June 2013. I love, love, love this car!!! Get good gas milage; 26 city; 31 hwy. The Toyota Care is outstanding. The only complaint I have is the upholstery. I bought what I thought was leather but it turns out to be Soft Tech which is a vinyl. The color is beige and stains very easily. Seats have blue jean staining and it will not come off! The dealership is no help on this issue. They "kinda" change the subject when I bring it up. I would buy the RAV4 again but would just go with the cloth seats unless genuine leather is offered.

This car is really nice. Easy to drive. I got the XLE model from Mark Jacobson Toyota in Raleigh/NC.
They were nice to deal with.
I like the drivers seat, it is very comfortable. The electronic gear shift, is also very handy. I got 32 miles on HWY. I had the front windows tinted and that helped out from the heat.
I think Toyota builds the best car for the money.
The one thing I would change is when you open the hood, you have to use the rod to hold it up.
Not a good idea.

We traded our 08Rav4 in for the 2013 Rav4 
We live in Upper Michigan where we get a lot of snow AND under the doors (including the back door)the snow & ice
collects
and then it melts
off in our garage creating a huge mess!
When you open the doors you can see the accumulation!
This is a real problem and had we knew this before ... we would have gotten a different brand vehicle.
Our old Rav did not do this. Perhaps Toyota should re design the doors and eliminate this problem

Great car and customer service. I am having trouble with the Bluetooth connection to my phone. It worked for the first 3 weeks and abruptly stopped. Took car back and no one seems to figure out what happened or fix it.

I bought my RAV 4 XLE two weeks ago. I drive more than 100 miles on most days and thought I could save on gas. It runs very well and gets good mileage. However, the seats and maybe the shocks are hard so that after seating for more than half an hour, it is no longer comfortable. I don't look forward to driving it long distance because the seats are just too hard.

Also, the rear passenger section should have cup holders on the side doors instead of just cupholders located in the center seat. If you have 3 people sitting in the back, you won't have any cup holders.

Bought XLE June 26 2013 and I love it!!! Have 2000 miles and get about 27 miles per gallon in city. Have not made any road trips yet. I am 5'11" and my husband is 6'2" and we both are quite comfortable. Vehicle has good pick up so no worries about merging onto interstate. Test drove Mazda CX5 and Honda CRV. RAV4 offered more options in the base price
and the cabin was not as noisy. Black carpet shows every speck of sand. Floor mats are a flimsy for the extra cost (nearly $300.00). Ordered an extra set online (must more cost friendly) to have on hand. "RAVen" (I have named her) is a real looker. Removal of "barn" rear door was the best thing ever!!!!

The good:
Technically, mechanically, this car is fantastic. It has the smoothest transmission, very nice pick up, and very quiet. 

The not-so-good:
The XLE version does not have power seats. Weird.

Detail review:
I have been researching crossovers since almost a month. I thought about getting a CRV, and I test drove 3 different ones, but all of them were noisy. The engine noise is high, combined that with the road noise was the deal breaker for me. The RAV4 is noiseless. Mechanically, this is a fantastic vehicle. The pick up is great, and it has three modes: eco, regular, sport. Loved the power steering on it too (better than CX-5, IMO).

Nice looking, more car like, great driving SUV.
The new 6-speed transmission is great.
Handling is very good.
There are three modes to choose from, Eco, Sport, and the default.
Seems to effect how the transmission is used.
In heavy traffic I prefer Sport mode because the car stays in the proper gear so you don't have to brake all the time.
Reasonably comfortable (I used to own a Buick).


I upgraded to the 2013 model primarily for the top-hinged hatch.
I make frequent trips with an inflatable kayak to the river and got tired of having to deal with the side opening door.
Much easier to work with now.
The back seat folds down nearly flat.
A big plus.

This is my first SUV, I've had it for 1 month and driving 600 miles. Initially, no matter how fun it was to drive, I questioned my decision to get the Rav4. The dash display told me my MPG and I was less than thrilled. However, I decided to track my own stats and I have no remaining doubt that I made the right choice. I just gassed up and calculated 29.8 mpg.
I traded in a 2001 Mazda 626 that got 23, and this ride is so much more comfortable and fun! The rear-view isn't too limited and it has loads of power and spunk. Extremely comfortable and well-designed cockpit. Classy-looking, too. Quiet, smooth cabin and fantastic sound clarity in stereo & Bluetooth. Recommended!

I just got my new Rav4 yesterday but have completely fallen in love with it.
I researched all the small SUV's and decided the Rav4 was the best value.
I wish the blind spot monitor was an option for the XLE.
Everyone that has seen it has commented on how it looks much more expensive than the $23,600 that we paid for it.
