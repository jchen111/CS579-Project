I traded my 2011 Dodge (Lemon) Journey with 7 months remaining on that lease for this SUV. Leased this RAV4 for 36 months and so far I couldn't be happier. I was concerned this SUV might be under powered with the 4 cyl especially after having 6 cyl for my last few vehicles. That concern was removed as my wife and I have just returned from driving 4750 mile vacation and the 4cyl was unbelievably great. Not only did I have enough power for cruising the interstates I was able to pass vehicles on two lane roads with no problem at all. Gas mileage was always between 28 & 32 MPG depending on conditions.

I got the front wheel drive Limited.
This was a replacement for my 2008 Honda CR-V.
I've always been a Honda customer.
I thought I'd try the Toyota after seeing a brand new exterior and the spare tire is no longer visible in the back.
I've had it only for a little over a month.
Although it is nice to look at (exterior and interior), you can tell it is the cheaper version of the CR-V.
The handling feels like a toy car. The ride is also bumpier.
The "leatherette" I am sure will wear off much faster than a leather.
It also stains very easily especially if oil based.
Even pens stain and is very hard to remove.
Also not as good visibility.
 Women will find the CR-V much easier to drive

bought new on 4/22...with only 500 miles on the odometer,car quit running while i was driving down the highway...felt like engine was revving up but car was not shifting into higher gear properly..freaked me out! had it towed to dealership and am waiting on a diagnosis...i am bitterly disappointed and wish i had bought a ford escape....NOTHING should go wrong with a vehicle that has only been driven 500 miles! now im stuck with a car that i will NEVER feel secure in.

I just purchased a new Rav4 last month and so far I am very happy with this purchase. It is very comfortable and has many great features.
