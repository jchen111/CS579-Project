 I have only 500 miles so far on the car, and I intend to update this over time.  So far I am getting 42.5 MPG in mixed driving. I have rented 2014 Nissan Altima's, several Prius's, and lots of Camry's.The Fusion Hybrid (2015 model) is better built, quieter, more refined, far more comfortable, and more sure-handling on corners than any of those cars-and it is not even close. But where the Fusion falls down, and perhaps all hybrids do, is in driving fun. My comparison in test driving, and for making the Fusion decision, was the VW Passat TDI (Diesel). I have heard that car gets a legitimate 38-40 MPG. And the Passat is a lot more fun to drive. But I picked the Fusion for higher reliability.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I love this car.  I have to admit something though.  The styling is directly out of a James Bond movie.  The front design, which looked exactly like the Astin - Martin sports car.  How is this possible for Ford to do this?  Easy one, they own part of the company so no lawsuits.  As a 70 year old man who still has a serious love affair with the James Bond myth what could I do but buy one.  Now I have to say it's doubtful that ever Bond were real he probably wouldn't have been driving a 4 door sedan but I can deal with that:o).  As every adult knows when you 'fall in love' with something you lose all negotiating ability.  I don't think I got a great deal but I love the car.

We got this car for my wife. Coming from rattling Toyota Sienna this was a heaven. We tried Camry but quality was not there. Great car, fun to drive, great mileage - not 47 but 44.5 will do. Have drive 5500 and no problems so far. For all those people who hate MFT>> Please explain what is wrong? The design is great with 4 quadrants. Everything is easily available. I find it way more intutive than my Lexus ES. I love the shockabsorbers and the ride. Just Drive. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is one of if not the best car I have ever owned. I and everyone I know think the cars looks are outstanding. My car has the appearance package with the five spoke wheels and the non low- rolling resistance tires, I expected to take a noticeable hit on the gas mileage because of this, but it just hasn't seemed to be the case. This cars handling and driving dynamics are just top notch, it's unusually quite, the seats are very comfortable and the gas mileage in fantastic. Now for the bad part; My Ford Touch is horrible, it's every bit as bad as the reviews say it is. it's a huge black eye on a otherwise great car experience. I hope Ford cures this problem in haste.

There is a learning curve on how to drive a hybrid and Ford gives you several coaching tools to help you maximize your mpg.
There are a few things you can do up front.
One is to make sure there is 35 lbs of pressure in each tire (check tire pressure when tires are cold or haven't be driven on in 8 hrs or more.)
Wax your car, slow down and ease on the accelerator and brakes.
Use the cruise control in the eco mode whenever possible.
Remember, by driving conservatively you also create less wear and tear on your vehicle and for the most part drive safer.
As compared to my 08 Accord EXL V6 the combined epa increases from 22 to 47 mpg, hence the $1.50 per gallon of gas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I bought my Fusion SE Hybrid on 2-26-14 and am averaging 40.5 mpg so far.
My trip odometer states that I traveled 415 miles on this tank and I still have more than 1/4 tank left or about 160 miles to empty.
Keep in mind, this is only a 13.5 gallon tank, NOT a 17 or 18 gallon tank, like many of it's non-hybrid competitors.
Basically, the tank holds 40-50% less gas than,
say a Nissan Altima's 18.5 gallon tank.
The Fusion rides very smoothly and quietly, much more so than my
2008 Honda Accord EXL V6. I
paid $24,178 (including the $150 document fee) plus taxes and title.
This is $3,913 off the MSRP of $28,100.
I financed the car at 1.65% thru RBFCU in San Antonio for 48 months.

I've had this car for 2 months now and I think I'm now a decent hybrid driver. However, I don't think this car can deliver 47 MPG. Theres an instrument on the dashboard called Fuel Economy that shows your average MPG. I ALWAYS reset it when I fill the tank and I ALWAYS get 51/52 MPG when I need to refuel. I was excited I was getting "52 MPG". However, I also ALWAYS reset the dashboard TRIP 1 mileage counter when I fill the tank. I started noticing that I consistently get approx 560 miles per gas tank when I end with 52 MPG. Unless I'm missing something, 560 miles divided by 13.5 gallons is only 41 MPG. I don't understand why the dashboard shows 52 MPG when I only get 560 miles per tank. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have had my fusion hybrid for about a month --and MPG is a learned behavior. First about my driving --right now I am commuting out of state 250 miles from home and then 40 miles round trip from the hotel to work. I drive with the traffic in 55&65 zone. The first week I got 39-41 MPG --which is what I expected and was totally ok with. The second week, I got 43.5 and the third week 45.3 and the 4th 47.1 -- You have to change the way you drive. Easy on the accelerator, to keep it in EV mode.I wait to speed up when the gas engine kicks in. Yes, 47 MPG (for 500+ miles) is possible -- and if you are getting mid-thirties, your driving style doesn't fit ANY hybrid. Use eco-cruise for better mpg.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Picked up my car about five days back.
I researched and was skeptical of gas consumption claims.
Some consumers had rated it rather bad.
However, I wanted and needed a low gas consumption vehicle.
I looked at and test drove many hybrids including Lexus, VW, Lincoln, Toyota.
This appealed to me after several test drives.

I have not regretted a moment since buying it.
It is very comfortable.
Quality of build is excellent and consumption is more than what Ford promised.
I am averaging around 45mpg on a very long daily commute of 110 miles round trip on a rather flat highway.
In city and shorter trips, I have achieved over 55mpg.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have read other reviews on the 2013 and 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid and saw the many complaints about the gas mileage. However, I am happy to report that with my 2014 I am currently averaging 47 mpg. There are 2 things to keep in mind: 1. If you are looking at purchasing this car it is because you want to save money on gas and increase your mpg. To do that, you must learn how to drive the car in all conditions and learn how the hybrid motor works to maximize your mpg. 2. It is not meant to be driven like a regular gas motor car. If you can adapt to this and want to maximize your fuel economy, this is the perfect car for it. The interior is absolutely amazing and comfortable too! Go look and se
