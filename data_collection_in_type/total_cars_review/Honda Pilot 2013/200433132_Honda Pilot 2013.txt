I love this vehicle so much!
It's a dream to drive.
I went from a luxury SUV to the Pilot & am pretty satisfied with it.
I love the way the Pilot drives & parks.
I've owned cars that don't handle as nicely as this truck does.
The only thing I would improve is the ride.
It's much rougher/tougher that my previous SUV, but other than that I'm in love.
If they keep this vehicle like this or improve it further I will be a Pilot owner for life.
