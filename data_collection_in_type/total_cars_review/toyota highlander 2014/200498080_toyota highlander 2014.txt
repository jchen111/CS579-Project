Bought a Limited Platinum 2014 highlander which now has a bit over 4,000 miles on it. It started making a "bump bump" sound when braking...sounds like something is rolling around in a truck, except there is no trunk! And, nothing at all 2nd and 3rd row seating except seats! 

Took it into to Toyota to get the noise fixed...and they heard it, checked it out for a couple of day. The final response we received from Toyota Corporate was keep driving it until they had enough complaints to recall or more thoroughly investigate it. That is not the espouse you want when you pay almost 50k on a new vehicle! If your vehicle has the same issue, please respond...
