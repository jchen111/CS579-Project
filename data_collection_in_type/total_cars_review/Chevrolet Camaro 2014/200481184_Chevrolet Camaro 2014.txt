I've had the car for a little over six months now and it still excites me every time i start it up.
The handling is incredible and ride quality was well above what I expected.
With a sports car you would expect a rough ride, this car feels comparable to a high comfort car.

I bought my 2014 2SS/RS as an early birthday gift to myself in October 2013.
I was a bit hesitant at first but I've wanted a Camaro for a very long time and figured it was time to splurge.
I spotted my Camaro on the lot and drove home the first one I test drove.
Of course, it was the model that had every bell and whistle imaginable....which was completely fine with me.
The dual exhaust gives my Camaro an amazing growl and, truth be told, I get excited EVERY time I start my ride.
I went from a 4 door, 4 cylinder Chevy Cobalt to 6.2L of pure muscle.
It's been quite a change and, admittedly, it's taken me awhile to get used to driving this Beast!
:)
But, I wouldn't change a thing!!!

I'm 42, married with two kids. I needed a midlife crisis fix. I test drove the 2014 Mustang GT 5.0 Challenger 5.7 Hemi and finally the Camaro 2SS 6.2 . Out of those three above mentioned choices, the Camaro impressed me by far. It doesn't have throttle lag like the Mustang. Handles surprisingly nicely around turns and doesn't float at high speeds like the Challenger. The only downfalls of my particular model is I hate the "skip shift" feature; making you shift from 1st to 4th under light throttle. The owner's manual stated this is designed to improve fuel economy. I have found that revving the engine above 2,000 rpms will allow you to shift normally. A true adrenaline rush, a blast to drive!

I'm 28, single. I wanted something fun to drive. I state this because there is no qualms about what this is- a fun vehicle to go Ricky Bobby fast on the weekends. 

The features that bother people- visibility, trunk opening, etc. are not really a consideration when I purchased this vehicle. 

My concerns, if any, would be the fuel economy. I understood it wouldn't be great upon purchase but it may stab your wallet to death. 

I just hit 400 mi. this morning and have used 2 tanks on a 19 gallon engine. Purchased with 50mi. on it. Tight budgets beware.

Red SS2, loaded w/ sunroof, nav, RS: $37,800 + TTL paid.

Also, I'm 6'2 and it's kind of a tight fit but you get used to it.
