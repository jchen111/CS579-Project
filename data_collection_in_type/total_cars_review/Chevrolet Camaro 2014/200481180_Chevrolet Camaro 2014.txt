Don't buy this car unless you can tolerate the unnerving sound and motion of gasoline sloshing back and forth at ever start and stop!  It is like a swimming pool is in your trunk.  The dealership solution is to sell you a different model car.  GM refusing to recognize the problem documented on many blogs and chat sites. The Gas Tank needs better internal baffling and or sound deadening.  Suggestions have been turn the radio up but when I have a Sport car want to listen to the engine not explosive liquid bouncing around in my gas tank. 

We saved since 2010 to buy our new 2014 Camaro RS and it was a great day .

At the time of this review I have 1500 miles on my Camaro.
So far so good.
I've been driving a Celica GTS TRD for a long time and had zero issues with that car so I am hoping for the same with this
GM product.


I am happy with all aspects of the Camaro.
The exterior looks and the performance are both tip top.
The interior took some getting used to.
The controls are not completely intuitive. I am not impressed with the steering wheel radio controls.
I also would have like to customize the in-dash menu selections for performance and mileage/trip readings.
The HUD is pretty cool and I like the choices of that display.
The manual tran is smooth shifting and solid.
