2014 Tundra 1794 edition. The more I drive it the more disappointment in what is missing from Toyota's highest line truck.
Since
new design for 2014 I expected
more than what you get.
No push button start as on most
toyotas, keyfob not linked to memory seats, no lane change
turn signals, no trailer brake controller, you can add aftermarket, just looks like an add on, only two door switches are lit, not even memory switches lit, no power lock on tailgate, no default for in call volume on bluetooth phone and even when on MAX setting not great, no rain sensing wipers, slow GPS nav. LED lights front not back,Good truck but could use some updated equipment.

Bought the new 1794, the truck is a masterpiece, I have a 2013 work truck Tundra and the interior of this truck was dated, the improvement is needed and has been thought out well, the voice activation is good although it takes some getting used to, but saves having to take your eye of the road to press buttons on a screen. The sat nav works well and a nice touch is that when you get close to a turn, you get a display on your drivers screen console. The engine is the same, it is a lovely powerful motor, but it likes a drink!
The build quality seems top class, although the carpet is a bit thin and not the quality it should be. The ride is the most comfortable i've driven.
