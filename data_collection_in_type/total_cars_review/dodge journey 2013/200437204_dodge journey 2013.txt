On June 1, 2014, was getting off a highway onto a ramp, stepped on brakes to slow down to ramp speed limit and then the brakes locked suddenly, and the vehicle came to an abrupt halt with the ignition still running. As expected everyone in the vehicle lurched forward. What a major scare! Have not had another incident since then. Have limited confidence in the vehicle now and am not willing to take it on long distance trips.

I decided to get down to 1 vehicle.
Got rid of a 2012 Malibu fully loaded and a 2006 Honda Element AWD.
I wanted all the comforts of the Malibu and the space and AWD of the Honda.
I narrowed down between Edge and Journey.
For the price (and I get supplier discount for either), the Journey gave me more bang for the buck.
dealer gave me a heck of a deal on a new Black version.
Not a fan until I had them paint the calipers red.
Only issue was the brake switch went out on a rear taillight.
It stayed on or came on for no reason.

It has done well this winter.
I have been very satisfied as a driver.
Passengers are not as comfortable in the front passenger seat.
