My 2.5 doesn't have Bluetooth/phone capability nor a touch screen.
But it has what matters most to me; a huge fun to drive personality.
I put sticky 225/45/17/wheels on the car shortly after buying it.
Highly recommended as it handles insane now and looks way better.
The stock rubber/wheels need to go straight to Craigslist.
Driven 2500 miles since new. My impressions so far:
-Prefer to now drive it all the time in manual mode except on the freeway. I find manual shifting the automatic to be a lot of fun and the shifts are responsive. I also like downshifting when coming to a stop. All this with while getting to rest my left leg.
-While it's not blazing "fast", it's far from slow eith
