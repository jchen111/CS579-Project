I do not own this car, however, I am frequently asked to drive it as favors.
First off, this car replaces a 2000 Odyssey which has cloth seats and gets better gas mileage with the same size engine. The cloth seats in the 2000 are more comfortable for long trips.
The car drives and handles well and the backup camera works great.
My main complaint are the leather seats. Up to approximately 100 miles, the seats are comfortable enough. After that, you may start experiencing numbness and sharp pains in your butt and legs. My passengers were also complaining about the seats during a trip back from NYC to the Poconos.

Long time Honda owner. Finally traded in my '04 EXL-RES that I bought new on a Wht/Truf '13 EXL-RES.
Many improvements in features and ride.
Love the interior and vehicle is excellent for long trips.
However after 5 months of ownership, quality issues are surfacing.
One wheel replaced for poor finish and now noticed others that should never have passed inspection.
Paint match on bumpers & painted trim is poor. Rough & thin paint (see through to dark plastic) where rear bumper meets quarter panel and base coat runs where rear quarter panel meets side door.
At just over 7K, began experiencing heavy vibration under moderate braking.
Not the quality expected on a $37K+ HONDA vehicle!!

I like most everything about this van, except the rear entertainment center.
Traded in a 2002 Ody with 176k for this one.
I have 3 kids and want to be able to play movies and music for them.
I pop a DVD in on the first road trip and the kids in the third row cannot hear the dialog unless the volume is turned all the way up.
I take it back to dealer to make sure all settings are correct and they tell me it is working as it should.
I call Honda and they tell me passengers should wear the headphones?!
The old Ody's RES worked great in all rows.
Pretty angry that RES will not "entertain".
