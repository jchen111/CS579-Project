I have owned my Forte for two years now. It has 17000 miles on it and we have driven it in all weather, all terrains, over much if the country without a problem. Ride is comfortable for class.
I recently got 42.6 mpg on a trip from the northeast to Georgia and back , and The car usually averages about 36-38 highway, 28 local.
Love the exterior staying for its classic, clean look.interior is bland, yes, but not junky, either.
This is my second Kia, the first,a Sportage was a great car which I traded in at 80K to get better more economy, never gave me a problem. I trust this car will of as well.

I recently purchased a 2012 Kia Forte EX.
I absolutely love my car.
It has plenty of pick-up, very quiet, great features and great gas mileage.
Recently took it on a little road trip and was very impressed with how well it ran.
It has more than enough room for my family of 4 and the trunk is large enough for our luggage plus my guitar.
