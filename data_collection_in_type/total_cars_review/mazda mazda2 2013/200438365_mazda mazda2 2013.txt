This car is very fun!When I totaled my Mazda3, I started looking at other cars but nothing came up to snuff like the Mazda.


At 100hp per 6k rpm's, it seems like not a lot, and it's not. With a 5M, you can push it a little more and have more control over the car. The interior is excellent in the touring model and does not feel like a tiny car. Road noise is not nearly as loud as I expected. It does well on long trips, getting about 36mi/gallon. I know this is weird to throw in, but this little car handles potholes really well.
And unlike one or two reviews I read, it does not "bounce" all over the road. It's very sturdy and handles pretty similarly to my Mazda3 (RIP).

I have two types of cars: The sports car I love and the work car I need.
It was time for me to replace my need car. so I wanted, cheep, easy to maintain, great mpg, and it had to be A STICK!
I looked at the Mazda2, Ford Fiesta, Hyundai accent, Chevy Sonic, and the Honda fit. Let make it REAL easy for you since I drove them all.

If you need cargo hauling-- go with the Honda fit.

If you want to be under the radar and the best warranty-- go with the Hyundai Accent.

If you need bells and whistles- Go with the Ford Fiesta.

If you need a compromise of the previous three --- Go with the Chevy Sonic.

But if you like a car that acts & feels like a sports car--- Mazda2 hands down!

I had concerns about the Mazda 2 based on other reviewers reports.
So far my experience has been very positive.
I almost bought a Honda Fit base.
But for less money I bought the Mazda2 Touring MT.
My feeling is that the Mazda is sportier and more fun to drive.
Also I am finding that with careful use of the stick you can get much better economy than reported by EPA.
On stop and go commute my mpg is mid to high thirties.
I have yet to spend much time on the highway but I won't be surprised to see over 40.
I like the interior and the exterior.
The build quality is evident.
Everything inside and on the dash is intuitive.
 More later...
