Loved my 2011 i Touring sedan so much that I recently traded in for a 2013 Grand i Touring hatch. Didn't think it could get any better, but it did!
Really love having the extra room in the hatch and the Skyactiv engine, which is going to save me about $600 bucks this year on gas.
I largely agree with other consumer reviews. It is definitely a firmer ride, but handles amazingly and very is responsive (the catch phrase is zoom zoom zoom for a reason!).
I actually like the construction of the cockpit-style dash, but it does take up some room leaving the overall interior on the small side.
This car is one of the sportier small compacts on the market, and it is a real pleasure to drive.

I have owned my car for one week and have enjoyed every minute of it. The only thing that I am having trouble with is setting up the SMS messaging with my iPhone.
