I was born in the 60's and grew up in the 70's when Chrysler didn't exactly have the best reputation among auto makers. 

I discovered the 2014 Durango because I use one very frequently for the company I work for.
I couldn't believe how quiet and smooth the ride is.
I used to joke around about the Durango being as smooth as a Mercedes.
Then, I found out it shares the same platform as the Mercedes GL series.


So, when my wife needed another vehicle I decided to get her a Durango.
She picked out a 2014 Rallye package and loves it. The kids love it.
The car is so quiet and smooth. The gas mileage is great.
After 8000 miles we average about 22mpg.
No maintenance issues.
