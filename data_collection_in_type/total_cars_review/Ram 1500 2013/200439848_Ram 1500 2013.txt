I purchased this model in 9/13.
This truck has the 3.7 6 cylinder mated to to Rams 8 speed automatic with active grill shutters which automatically close at highway speeds for economy.
Its rated at 17 city, and 25 hwy.
I have never gotten less than 20mpg in the city!
The ride is smooth and comfortable, the design beats the domestic rivals hands down in looks and driveability.
I got my Tradesman with power windows, locks, satellite radio, cruise, remote tail gate locking, tow package, bedliner etc for under 23,000.
Guys you wont find a nicer better looking, and driving truck for this amount. I give it 5 stars. Plus free 5yr roadside assistance and 100k power train warranty
