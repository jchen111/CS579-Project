I've had the Avalon hybrid for 5 months.  So far, the gas mileage has been decent, but with the a//c on, the mileage is less than advertised.  The navigation system is ok but not as feature driven as some.  For example, if I want to know the nearest Walgreens, it does not allow me to enter that as search criteria.  However, it does work well with a normal address.  The volume of the voice is changeable with nav setup.  The ride is comfortable with lots of legroom in the back.  The Entune system is good, except it uses a lot of battery power from my phone, so I don't use it.  In ECO mode, the car provides enough power for normal use, and with it off, it is quite fast.

Over all we love this car. Roomy sedan front and back with lux finishes. The trunk is smaller than non- hybrid big sedans but very respectable.
Actual mileage /per gallon is truly impressive. Our friends with Lexus are envious. 
The chrome bezel on the dash is a negative when the sunlight hits it just right. Toyota could easily fix that. This car does not offer the softest ride on a bad road, as has been noted. However, we are city drivers with fairly frequent extended long distance freeway trips. Not an issue.

I've had the 2014 Avalon XLE Touring Hybrid for about three weeks now.
I'm really enjoying the vehicle so far.
The fuel efficiency has been as advertised for the first 1000 miles.
I've done a mixture of highway and city driving and have been averaging just below 39 mpg according to infotainment system.
This vehicle fit my needs perfectly.
I needed a daily driver that was really fuel efficient but had the space I needed to haul kids and sports equipment on the weekends.
Check and check for this Avalon.
It's pretty impressive to have a large sedan get this fuel efficiency and provide a large trunk and rear passenger space.
The hybrid option was a no brainer for me.
