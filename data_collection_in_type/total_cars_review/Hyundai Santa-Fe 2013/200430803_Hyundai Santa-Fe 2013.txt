My Santa Fe Sport is my first crossover vehicle and is a blast to drive. For the first time, I'm sitting up higher and I have greater road visibility. I test drove several other small SUVs, but the Sport had the smoothest ride and was the most comfortable.

Only 5000 miles since the Dec. 15th 2013 purchase and so far so good. I have had no steering issues at all that I keep reading about. I gave up my 2006 4runner 4.7l V8 with 95000 miles that I loved, to get better gas mileage and 22 city and 30 hwy is great out of this 2.4l . The only issue , so far is the loss of power for a split second or 2 that only happens at an idle when Im getting read to pull out in traffic or say make a left turn. You start to depress the throttle only to have nothing happen for that second or two,quite disturbing for that short
moment.This has happened 4 times and the pattern seems to be only on 95+ degree days

For me this vehicle has one major shortcoming. The front passenger seat does not flip forward to provide added length for carrying
extra long items, such as 8ft. lumber. I previously owned a 2006 Hyundai Tucson and the back rest of the front passenger's seat inclined forward all the way into a flat position which allowed me to conveniently carry 8 ft. lengths of stock with the rear door closed. Not having the ability to do it on my Sante Fe is a major oversight by the Hyundai developmental Engineering group. I'm confident that there are many owners out there who share my displeasure over this incapability.
After all, The Sante Fe sport is a cross between a car and a truck.

Just bought my first new car in 28 years!
I had been looking at the Santa Fe SUV for 2 years.
Matt was great and very informative and I was able to secure a very good deal.

I really enjoy my New Santa Fe, this is my 3rd Hyundai. I owned a GT Elantra (manual) and I still have my 2005 Santa Fe GLS, at 126,000 plus miles it still runs great.
I tested BMW,Subaru, Audi, Explorer, Toyota, and after testing the new Santa Fe, I opted for another one.
I chose Pearl white, first time with a bright color, my 2005 is black. Love to drive it, everyone loves the interior and exterior.
My only concern had been the reviews on steering, so I tested roads, city and highway driving.
People need to understand its a new technology, electronic, and all modes are sensitive to roads and conditions, and each wheel is sensitive to dry, wet, rocky pavement.
Love it, I feel secure!

I bought our Santa Fe 2013 in Canada mid Sept 2012. We have experienced many issues after 6 months and 14,000 km (8,700 miles):

1) warning of fuel cap open (fixed after 2 visits) 2) noise on steering column could hear it when stopping the car, part ordered and changed problem solved
3) leather steering wheel cracked, changed warranty, 2 complaints)
4) driver seat was loose, it seems to be a widespread problem (fixed 3 months)
5) Recall of rear camera:risk of fire, fixed 
6) Mix mileage is poor, best achieved was 8-10 km/l, not solved (Hyundai Fuel program: card with CAD$42/6,000km a big joke)
7) Found today water leak on driver side below the dashboard. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR!

I only have 500 miles on the car but I did have a scary steering problem with an easy fix.
Driving on the freeway I was also experiencing wandering and went to the dealership to return the car.
While at the dealership I by chance checked the tire pressure, all tires were at 45psi, we let the air out of each tire to 35psi and she's been driving like a dream.
I filled up yesterday and parked at home with a 22.3 mpg computer reading.
I went skiing this morning 1st going for coffee and then up a Canyon to a ski resort.
After a most excellent day of skiing returned home with a computer reading of 23.9mpg!

I bought this vehicle a week ago and have to advise you to not purchase until Hyundai has a solution to the steering problem.


The car doesn't track straight at all, darting left and then right requiring constant and exhausting corrections to the wheel.
The wheel doesn't center itself.


To explain what I mean, while going around a curve if you remove your hands from the wheel, the car continues to go around the curve.
It never makes any movement to center the wheel and track straight.
 

At highway speeds I have never felt less in control.
Even with two hands on the wheel driving for more than 15 minutes is a frightening and tiring experience.
