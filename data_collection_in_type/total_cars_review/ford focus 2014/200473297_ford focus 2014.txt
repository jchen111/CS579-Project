I'm so happy that I decided to buy this car.  It is very smooth, nimble, agile, and sporty. The titanium hatchback model could compare to most of  expensive luxury sub compact European cars.  You feel very stable when driving this car specially on tight turns.  With only 2.0 engine, it feels very strong and the car can accelerate much quicker compare to other sub compact cars with the same engine size.

So I finally made up my mind. I was considering a Mazda 3 but in the end I bought the Ford Focus Titanium w/handling PKG. I could not get over the UGLY pod on the Mazda's dash. This is my first Ford and I hope I don't regret it. Although I read countless reviews and words of wisdom from critics I decided that the issue with the transmissions was one of understanding instead of criticizing. Once you understand the way it works then it is easier to overcome it's quirks when you compare to a fully auto tranny. I like it! Overall the car has exceeded my expectations. Considering the car's heritage and Ford's intentions when they design this car I feel it is a great European flavor Ford.

We have about 1300 miles on my new Focus Titanium Hatchback, black. We purchased the special handling package. I love how the car drives, suspension is solid but comfortable, steering is tight and responsive. It's not a race car or the ST for that matter, but it has a sporty, peppy performance and gets incredible gas mileage. We have a van and use this car to commute to work, run errands, etc.. did I mention - gas mileage is amazing! The car is quiet, comfortable and has all the bells and whistles. I would not hesitate to take it on a long trip. As a rule I am not a fan of compact cars but this one has me sold - It's a fun car and my wife and I both look forward to driving it!

This is "my" first brand new car and I have to say, it is wonderful. My wife bought a brand new Mitsubishi in 2011 and my Focus has been a better experience all around.

I've owned mostly imports for the past 10 yrs and I just decided to move on from my 07 Mazda3 with 160k on it, so I took advantage of Black Friday and got a very good deal on a Focus Hatch Titanium. 
It came down to the Mazda3, Cruze Diesel, Golf Diesel or Focus. I was seeking MPGs, sportiness and comfort. All were great cars w/ their own pros/cons, something about the Focus grabbed me. Ford has caught my eye w/ their recent designs and I'd had a great experience w/ a Sport Trac so I decided to give Ford a try. 
So far the car has been awesome (~2k miles). I drive a ton for work, so I'll keep you posted on progress. If you're considering the Focus, I highly recommend it.

Very sporty and good looking car,1100 miles driven and loving every minute of it.
