My last six cars included four Acuras and one Mercedes.  And I am VERY pleased with how the Fusion feels when I drive it.  I have the SE with the 1.5 ecoboost engine.  Options include black 18" rims, MyFordTouch with GPS, sunroof, luxury package, and remote start.  I really wanted a 2015 with the Terracotta package (love the color, and the package throws in the sports seats from the Titanium) but the deals on the 2014s were too good to ignore.  Plus I loved the silver SE with black rims on the dealer lot.  VERY sporty yet the ride with the 18" rims is fine (don't get the 19's as the ride gets jittery!).

The plastic rear end has horrible quality.  There are 3 or more defects in the surface around the rear license plate on all of these.  The rear doors, the front and rear bumpers and the rear tail lights do not line up well.  The front door interior arm rest extends into the A-frame and thus sticks you in  the rear end every time you enter the car.  Mine has < 1500 miles and has left me stranded TWICE, with a dead battery.  When the battery is dead you cannot unlock your car or get into the trunk without breaking the front driver's door handle to expose the keylock. Even then you cannot open any other doors or the trunk.  You cannot move it because it will not come out of park....thanks Ford.

Just purchased a 2014 Fusion SE with the 1.5 Ecoboost, 201A PKG, Navigation and Technology PKG. In searching for a sedan for work, to replace an Impala, I was looking for something stylish, good performance, fun & comfortable to drive while maintaining some economy. Sounds like a lot to ask for, and all of that for under $30,000. 

The Fusion with the all of the options fit the bill. I only have 250 miles, and so I really cant tell you much yet, but the first 250 miles have been awesome. I will follow up at around 15,000 miles, and that should not take long, as I average about 20,000-30,000 per year.

We are very excited about our purchase of the 2014 Ford Fusion.
I had thought that our next vehicle would be a compact SUV, but seeing the Fusion out on the road and then at the dealership I knew that this was going to be our next car.
Wonderful price for what you are getting!

I have noticed over the past couple of months that I am having a problem with a waxy material running down over my headlights. I had the service manager from the local Ford dealer take some pictures and send them to Ford Canada. I did not hear of any results until a number of other new Ford owners started coming in with the same problem. It is a problem that is not unique to the Fusion, but is apparently happening to several 2014 models. After a few weeks and several phone calls to the dealer they informed me that Ford is using this waxy material as a form of rustproofing on the inside of the front fenders. When the temperature goes up this stuff is melting and running down over the lights.

I have driven Fusion's before and they never fail to impress me.
I would choose this vehicle over several in the model comparision. Althought I find the new seat design an issue.
I just could not get comfortable in the car for the first several miles.
Luckily this was not a road trip vehicle for me.

I absolutely love my 2014 Ford Fusion SE 1.5L Ecoboost! I just happened to be at a Ford Dealership with a friend picking up her car that was serviced when I first saw the 2014 Ford Fusion. It's sportiness caught my eye amongst all the other cars on the show room floor. I was shocked when I found out it was a Ford Fusion. This dealership also sell Lincoln etc. I test drove the Infiniti G37, Mercedes C300, BMW 328I, Acura TSX and TL and others. The 2014 Ford Fusion was the first car that I immediately fell in love with! I was amazed at all the features I was able to get for my budget of under $35k. leather, sunroof, mytouch with nav,rear camera, heated seats, parking assist, etc.

I have the 1.6 with the manual transmission.
I love the Sync, the voice commands work so well, you can say the complete address all at once and it understands 95% of the time.
Very comfortable ride and very quite.
The only thing I don't like is the MPG, I do a lot of highway driving and I can't average more than 28, and I'm not driving hard.
The car only has 3,000 miles, hopefully the MPGs will improve over time.
Overall I'm very impressed, it's a lot of car for $30K.

Just got a brand new 2014 fusion.
This weekend we took her on her first trip, 200 miles down to Vriginia Beach.
An hour in, the transmission slipped and sent the tachomenter racing.
Took my foot off the gas to let it catch again.
It kept doing this, especially on inclines. I was very scared.
Then a wrench icon popped up.
Great, in I95 traffic with a brand new yet screwed up car.
Well, didnt do much on my vacation in fear of breaking down.
Driving back I only allowed myself to go 60mph, even in a 65mph zone, because I didn't want to break down.
It worked. Also when I am at a red light,
 the car shudders and wants to stall.
This started a month ago.

To steal a line form Buick, this isn't your grandmother's Ford! Wow, my new Ford Fusion SE with 1.5 L Ecoboost is awesome!
My previous car was a 2009 Honda Accord EX-L V6, so naturally I test drove a new Accord, then tested a Fusion. I was amazed, the Fusion out-classed the Accord in every regard. The Accord's V6 was a bit quicker, but the Ecoboost's tiny 1.5 liter turbo is close, and the 7 to 10 extra mpg at interstate speeds (70+ mph) more than makes up for the small difference. The Fusion is quieter, rides and handles better and is way better looking than an Accord which has changed little since 2008. Ford Sync is easy to learn despite some reviews to the contrary and the stereo rocks!
