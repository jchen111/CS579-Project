Had my 2013 Explorer Base - AWD - for a little over a year. The car has performed perfectly for me. Plenty of pick up & power between 3-4RPM but your MPG will hurt. I can average 19-20MPG Compbined City & HWY. The interior blows away the Chevy competition, can't speak towards dodge and other direct competitors. So far the only issue i've had has been with the gas tank. Car infront of me lost its muffler and i couldn't avoid. it struck my gas tank causing the sending unit to fail. a $25 part cost me almost $500 because of the time to take down the sattle style gas tank.
