I bought my Ford Explorer 2013 with about 10,000 miles on it from a car dealer in MA. Besides the manufacturer warranty, that car was a Ford Certified vehicle, which an additional 12,000 miles and 12 months warranty. All was worth less from the first problem with the car. The car started leaking water through the seat belts of the back seat, and here was the moment of truth. Dealers were reluctant to accept the car for service, and when I tried to lure them by including oil change and break service, they gave me two appointments, now for oil change and break job but weeks for the water leak. This experience involved about four dealers one of them is about an hour and a half from my home.

Why did I wait so long to trade in my 2003 Ford explorer for the new 2014 ford explorer limited!
I test drove the limited, awd & 4 cyl. ecoboost; plus th xlt & sport.
Of all of them, the limited offers the most comfort & advanced options I was looking for.
This truck rides so much more car like than my last explorer.
Additionally, I like the pickup from the regular 3.5L 6 cylinder engine on the limited vs. the ecoboost 2.0L 4 cylinder.
I think a 4 cyl. is good for a car, but not an suv.
I recently took a carload of teenagers in my limited and it handled beautifully with the "extra weight" in the car.
I don't think the 4 cyl. could have handled that.
