Admittedly, I'm kind of a "car nut". I traded my 2011 Sonata Limited after 4 years, it's a good car with lots of features but the ride was a little hard on bumpy roads.
So I bought the 2014 Altima SL (4 cyc).
Very Nice looking car with a well thought out interior, spacious and super comfortable.
The ride is smooth and quiet and takes bumpy surfaces really well (as well as my wife's Lexus 350).
The car handles well and does get impressive gas milage.
The 4 cyc is peppy and provides all the power a driver really needs.
This is a beautiful car.

I wanted to like this car.
The electrical system has been very shoddy.
The key fob malfunctions frequently and the remote doesn't work if it is below freezing.
The car squeaks when going over bumps and the dash vibrates at 45 mph.
The seats in the car have worn very poorly and look like they have been in the car for over 100k miles.
Great looking car, very poor quality.
I would buy another 
Nissan but would steer clear of the Altima

After my Passat with 200k miles stranded me last week, I decided to bite the bullet and replace it. Looked at the new Avalon but I didn't like the touch controls for the heating/AC. Bought a 2014 Altima 2.5 SL instead. Very impressive car. I really like the interior and it drives like a dream. No issues with engine noise as others are suggesting. The 4 cylinder / CVT combination feels just as lively as the Passat's V6 with Tiptronic. I just hope it lasts as long!
