I bought this car new, and love every second of it. I have topped out @ 42MPG's on the hwy. and for a 6-cyl that is not hybrid. It took some getting used to since it is a new car. There have been a great many biased reviewers that have never even bought the car. I feel that it is better that someone who owns the car should say what issues I am having. I have no idea what these people are talking about! I have had the car for 3 months and have had none of the issues people are claiming, it has been perfect! Beautiful car, and get lots of compliments. Don't believe what others are saying, go test it out yourself, I warn you, you may end up driving it home!

Too many bells and whistles that don't work.
This is my 4th Accord in 20+ years, and by far the worst, most annoying experience.
Delivered with an inoperable CD player so the entire audio unit had to be replaced from the factory.
Then the audio had to
be repaired under a recall because the sound would fade in and out and be drowned in buzzing static.
Virtually no bass/subwoofer - my 1999 and 2006 Accord had better sound.
Will be going back to dealer for the third time in less than 6 months I've owned it to find out why all speed dial settiings are sporadically erased but the voice tags remain.
Also speed dial numbers aren't always accessible even when they're displayed/

Applies to the Touring Model, FULLY loaded:

The bottom line is this:
 The value is nearly impossible to beat.
Although the car ain't no Audi, if it had hydraulic steering, it could pass as an Acura TL hands-down and be priced as a $42,000 car--no joke.
 In fact, technologically, its interior is far superior to the Acura.

If you are looking for a near-luxury, sporty family sedan under $35,000 that uses regular gasoline, then this is likely your car.
You just have to make sure you can compromise with the very un-Honda-like electric steering.

It's worth noting that the Altima is a serious competitor here, but the lack of rear-headroom and the lame sound system ruined it for me.

The midcar sedan segment is hyper competitive but there is a huge difference between styling vs. substance.
I
looked at several cool looking, swoopy cars with fascinating digital dashboards, but nothing compared to the Honda's driving experience, and I drove them back to back.


Interior materials and fit and finish are now a 10 out of 10 (prior model's was really unacceptable).
I slightly miss the double wishbone suspension but it's hard to really notice due to the virtually flawless execution of the package as a whole.
If you value the driving experience more than just styling and appearance, this is the sedan to own - especially given its reliability.
A masterpiece of engineering
