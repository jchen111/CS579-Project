I have a super commute that makes fuel mileage a priority which the Civic does a great job however comfort and convenience suffered 

Now with the new Accord EXL coupe I have good mileage combined with a quiet comfortable ride wrapped in more technology then seems possible

It does not match my wife's A5 in luxury but it is not all that far away
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like the car, think it is very comfortable, agree with other issues, center console lid should slide so can use as arm rest, but get use it and I am short.
Anyways, having issues with the radio with static and have had all the presets disappear one time now (they did come back after a while).
The issue acts like a short, went to the dealer and they said have another similar complaint, they said Honda says it is a software problem, wish they told me when I called an made and showed up for the service appt.
The problem is not fixed, googled the issue.
I didn't see anything about it. This is irritating.
Asked if Honda would call me or if I had to call them again and told didn't know.

EX-L-4
Wish I'd looked closer & at other cars first to compare. Seat is hard & seat seam hits you wrong. Lttle open space for glasses & badges. Arm rests are next to useless & Very little CD storage. No garage door button on EX-L-4?
Rough & hard ride.
Can't find comfort spot while seated. Test drive on saleman's route didn't show hard ride, wife drove, her car. Loved previous 3 Accords, kick myself hard for not looking harder at 2013. Already has vibration rattle.

Love design, looks, cameras, power, rear seat room, plus other stuff, don't like sitting & driving the car. We will adapt & adjust, have to, but have real remorse about buying it. Loved previous Accords, Not this one.
