Purchased this R spec 3/22/13. Coming up on first 1000 miles, Love this car so far! This is our 2nd Hyundai in 2 yrs, My wife drive a 2011 Sonata 2.0T and we love that car as well. The 2.0 direct injected variable valve timing turbo engine is very stout and with 30k on the Sonata, trouble free. I hoped Hyundai would put that engine in the Genesis coupe, so when they did it was a done deal for me. That engine mated to a 6 spd manual is really fun to drive and I love the new look of the coupe. I also appreciate the simplicity of a rear wheel drive 4 cylinder. I am a experienced auto tech (30+ yrs) and find this car to be well thought out. Looking forward to a long term relationship.
