I bought my 2013 Jetta 2.5 SE with 4,000 miles on it four months ago and it now has 15,000 miles.
I work as an outside salesperson and was looking for a car that would get great gas mileage and still have some style.
I did not have a Jetta in mind, but the mileage and price were both right, so I test drove it and to my surprise liked it a lot despite it being fairly vanilla on the style front.
After four months, this car represents who I am very well, a business man.
The looks are nice and clean.
Not too boring, but not extroverted.
The ride is generally compliant, quite nice on the interstate but very firm on rough pavement.
Impressed with the highway mileage which has been 37 mpg.
