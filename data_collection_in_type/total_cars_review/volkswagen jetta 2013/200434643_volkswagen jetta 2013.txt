We purchased our Toffee Brown 2013 Jetta TDI last summer, and have thoroughly enjoyed it.
My folks have a 2011 Jetta TDI Sportwagen, so I had the pleasure of driving their car on occasion, and was immediately hooked on its performance and power, with such incredible fuel economy.
We have 2 sons, and it transports the 4 of us around very comfortably.
I love that the actual MPG is even BETTER than what is advertised. We get about 38 around town, and have gotten 51 on freeway trips.
Love the V-tex Leatherette interior--so easy to clean. Just a great all-around vehicle.

Bought this car in November of 2012 and optioned it with Bluetooth, RCD-510 Touch Screen radio and a sunroof.
I love it!
Its a great city car, however it needs to have lots of highway miles due to its DPF(Diesel Particulate Filter) not burning the soot properly in city conditions,so it clogs up.
That was when my mom had it for a week when I was gone and when I stepped into it a warning light came on that it was clogged.
I phoned VW and they said drive
it on the highway for a few miles and the light will go out. And so it did.
I get 46 mpg combined, its a blast to drive, but it needs a bout 20 more hp when merging at freeway speeds.
But going slower, there is gobs of torque! I love it!
