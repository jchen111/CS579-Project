Like other reviewers I had a bit of buyers remorse upon driving this car home from the dealer.
No auto headlamps, compass, auto dimming review mirror or back up cam left me a little disappointed.
The car grew on me once I got used to it.
It is fun to drive and I enjoy getting 50mpg on the highway.
At 8k the paint on the front bumper started to chip off very easily.
After three different attempts to have VW repaint the bumper they refused to do so.
This was my first VW and will be my last.
I will not buy cars from a manufacturer that doesn't stand behind it's product.
