Kia and Hyundai are the same company, and both build great, value packed vehicles. The KIAs are more targeted towards people who like sporty and stand out styling in their daily drivers.

I love my 2013 KIA Soul Exclaim..and after more than a year after purchase has proven to be reliable, extremely well made and overall a fun car.

The standard level of equipment is astonishing for what you pay. The powerful 8 speaker Infinity sound system for example is the best I've heard in ANY car. It even includes a separate powered sub-woofer! 8 speakers in total!  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm glad I finally found a car brand that doesn't build junk! KIA! Not only did I buy a new 2013 Soul Exclaim for myself...but also my wife got a new Sorento (made at KIA's West Point USA Factory!), my daughter bought a Sportage, my son got a new Forte AND a Soul also! 

Several great reasons to buy from KIA...
1) Quality. 2nd to none.

2) Perfect paint, well made, all the body panels line up.

3) Crazy level of standard equipment for the price. Bluetooth, steering wheel controls for sound system, backup camera! 

4) Even the Dealerships for KIA are professional, clean, friendly and helpful. I'm not used to that...I used to have all Fords! 

5) The KIA styling is world class...

Reliability would be a 6 or higher if the Edmunds ratings went that high! Build quality also.

I've owned brand new Hondas, Toyotas, Fords, a FIAT, Prius, Chevrolets, a 308 GTS Frerrari, a Mercedes....etc. All my family started trading in their cars for brand new KIA's in 2011. Including mine (2013 Soul), my wifes (2013 Sorento), my Daughters 2013 Sportage, my son and daughter-in-laws 2 Fortes, and the list goes on.

No lemons, no issues, perfect build quality, great mileage, awsum paint jobs, a crazy amount of standard equipment that is unexpected in cars at this price...and a 100,000 mile drive train warranty is icing on the KIA cake!

I bought my Kia Soul ! in March 2013 and absolutely love it.
I think it fits my personality and lifestyle perfectly. I have a yellow lab and can easily throw her in the back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ironically I had a kia soul plus, one that I got in 2010 and I had no complaints with it. I had a wreck in December of 2012 and had to get another car. I
chose to upgrade and get another soul exclaim, premium package. BIG MISTAKE!! It is an extremely bumpy ride and my kia plus wasn't like that so I was confused by this!!! The leather seats are so hard I had to get a cushion to place on the seats. Whenever I clean my seats or sit on them, lent is always left on them. No matter what I do, lent is always left!!!! Plus i have nothing but problems with the Bluetooth!! The mpg is acceptable I guess and the wheel turns nicely. Those are the redeeming qualities. ALL in all i'm disappointed.

If you haven't bought one of these yet when on your test drive make sure you take it out on the interstate then roll the back windows down about halfway. The noise and vibration you will have is un bearable. You can't even talk to anyone not even the passenger. In addition roll down the drivers window about two inches while the back windows are down. It will shake so violently you will think it will shatter. I have spoken to many KIA dealers and they say this is a definite design flaw on several of their vehicles and cannot be resolved. They have contacted KIA engineering and they suggest keeping the windows rolled up at high speeds. Yeah right. Had I know this I would have NEVER bought one

I absolutely love, love my Kia!
I went with the Exclaim as I wanted all upgrades possible and am glad I did.
There is not a feature I could imagine that is not in this vehicle.
They thought of everything.
I love the way it handles and the roll back feature also.
The car is very solid and lots and lots of room.
Nice and peppy and handles well in the rainy conditions we have been having.
So very glad I traded and feel a joy just driving my car!! Now, if I can get it from being dinged in parking lots life would be perfect!!!!

I have always owned large 4X4 quad-cab trucks but got sick of dumping money in gas. I wanted a vehicle that was easy on gas, fun to drive, fit in my garage, and loaded with options. I researched for a few months and narrowed it down to about six finalists. I test drove them and narrowed it to two, the Hyundai Elantra and the Soul Exclaim. I love both vehicles but the Soul won me over because of the cargo capacity and ease of access. The Soul is fun to drive and I like the high seating position. It doesn't feel like I'm down in a go cart. Visibility is outstanding and the interior is perfect. My gas mileage is very good. I average 24 city, 31 highway and 35 on long country drives.

Aparently the reviewer below mine hasn't heard about the problems the EPA found with the sticker listed on the KIA car models with wrong fuel mileage...caused by an error in the testing done by KIA in Korea on the KIA Soul and a few other KIA models. 

To make a long story short...the base Soul actual fuel mileage for example was LISTED on the window sticker as 27/35 mpg but new figures are 25/30 for the smaller 1.6 base engine...and for the bigger 2.0 engine it WAS 26/29 mpg listed and actual new figures are less mpg to.

I signed up with KIA and now get a KIA debit card to use for gasoline based on how far I drive and they add 15% more for your trouble. Simply register with KIA.

I have had many new cars and trucks over the years, and by far I was the most impressed by the 2013 KIA Soul Exclaim I bought recently.
The Exclaim is the top of the line Soul, but even the Base Soul is well loaded and an excellant value. But the Soul is more about value than "just" being inexpensive. I love the standard moon roof on a warn sunny day!

 It has remarkable quality...perfect paint, very well assembled, top crash test scores, all the safety equipment available, great looking vehicle that stands out compared to the common vanilla Corolla/Civics that you see everywhere. And the 100,000 mile
10 year warranty is just icing on the cake!
