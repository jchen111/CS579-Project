Ever since I purchased this truck I have dealt with a transmission that constantly up and down shifts especially at slow speeds.  It's as if the computer can't decide what gear the tranny should be in so it keeps switching back and forth between gears.   The result is hesitation then clanking as the car accelerates or reduces speed.   I have been back to the dealership on multiple occassions and as expected they can't replicate the problem???Ironically anyone I let drive the truck always comes back and says what's up with your transmission.   I can't believe I was the only "lucky" guy that purchased a lemon.   I wish GMC would at least acknowledge there is an issue!!!!!!

Strange to read all the horror stories about vibration, clunks, trans slipping.
I have a 2014 Sierra V6 WT with the only options of a locking rear differential and a hitch.
I crank my windows.
Have about 2000 miles on it now.
It is quiet, shifts smoothly, rides firm but it is a truck.
It is quite powerful if you lay into it, most of the time I don't and it gets 18-19 city.
Not sure about hwy yet but indications are it will get the advertised 24 hwy.
No rattles or strange noises, actually it is very quiet.
I wish it had a better exhaust note.
You have to turn down the radio and concentrate to feel it go from V6 to V4 and back.
The reg cab lighting could be better.
