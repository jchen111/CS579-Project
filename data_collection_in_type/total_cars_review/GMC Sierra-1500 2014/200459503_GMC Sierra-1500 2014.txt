6 month update. Gm has not fixed any thing since new. Radio GPS headlights are still awfull. 5 Recalls so far. New problems leather coming off seats,look like 50 year old bomber jacket. Dash settings constantly reset, rattles every where,seems dealer can not hear it. Was getting 16 mpg,after fire flash recall dropped to 13-14,dealer says that was expected. (not when I bought it), Tried to trade it in on new Toyota,they would not take it. $50k pos. Advertised as professional grade, the only thing I am getting professional at is taking it to the dealer

I bought mine about one month ago.
Nice sexy black truck all the toys.
Mile mark 480 noise coming from the rear end.
GM tried to say it was the displacement on demand.
Turned out to be a bad ring gear.
Truck ended up needing a whole new rear end.
Mile mark 680 transmission is clinging and clanging under normal driving conditions with decelerating only to be followed by not knowing what gear to select with I put my foot back on the gas.
Today it was stuck in 2nd gear for about 8 seconds.
Also new today, the truck stalled with a huge bang in the transmission when shifting from R to D.
I like the truck a lot when it is parked.
Not so much when driving. Buyer beware...
