I have just purchased a Chrysler 200 Touring with the V-6 engine.
The ride is excellent, very comfortable to sit in.
The pick-up, when you step on the gas, is great.
I choose the deep cherry red and it really stands out.
I have just over 300 miles on the vehicle and am averaging 27 mpg.
This is a lot better than my old 2004 Dodge Durango with the Hemi engine.
All in all I am very satisfied with my trade.
