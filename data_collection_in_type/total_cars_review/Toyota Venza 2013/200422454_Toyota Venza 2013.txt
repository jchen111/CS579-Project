We purchased approx 4 mths ago and still believe this is one of the great value cars in the market today/ We just came back from a 2500 mile trip with our venza
This car has performed like a dream, no problems on anything since purchase.
Electronics are great, satellite radio -wow this made time much easier with time.
Mileage varied from 26-30 MPG (depending on road condition etc., so happy we can burn regular fuel.
You will not be dissatisfied with this vehicle. We purchased the limited model. My wife and I love this vechilce!

A quick update on my 2013 Limited FWD.
Am averaging 25 mpg (actual, not computer). Overall a nice vehicle.
However, if you live in a rural location beware, rodents LOVE the wires & hoses in this car.
I've spent $350 replacing various under hood bits after a large rat took up residence (later dying in the cabin AC filter box).
The dealer acknowledges this is a problem due to eco friendly material being used that attract rodents. They suggest taking countermeasures like mothballs, hot pepper spray on wires/hoses and fox urine spray in wheel wells.
 My Buick was never touched for 2.5 years but within 6 weeks the Venza was a buffet.
My cat stays busy but can't kill them all.

Had 2010 Mercedes GLK350.
Traded for Venza and so glad we did!
This suv and I call suv as it is closer to suv than wagon by a big margin. Is a great automobile.
Smooth ride, great construction and space that exceeded our expectations. The v-6 performs wonderfully, shifts smooth and ride meets all expectations.
We had now for about 3 months with no problems, mileage on road about 26-29 mpg, not bad.
(note at least this auto has a spare tire the Glk 350 had just a air pump-no spare tire.
We got the LIMITED version of Venza and so glad we did, many many improvements with top notch equipment.
We did not want to spend extra money on Limited, but after using features would not do with out.

Just took delivery of a 2013 Venza FWD Limited.
Cross shopped this vehicle with the Honda Crosstour and considered the Ford Edge.
I liked the exterior stying and relative quiet and performance.
Reliability remains to be seen but hope it's better than my previous GM product.
I'm hoping gas mileage is 23 mpg or better as most of my driving is on the highway at cruising speeds.
