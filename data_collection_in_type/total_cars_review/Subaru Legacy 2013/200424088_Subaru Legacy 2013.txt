We got a 2013 Subaru Legacy Limited... The interior toys are not as modern but functional and reliable. But it definitely out performs then the Nissan Altima we lease. Handling is great, power is smooth,, MPG consistent 28 mixed up to 33 - 34 hwy, depends on how you drive. The AWD is incredible and the car feels solid... In NJ 2014 winter it was flawless blast through snow and take the potholes great... Subaru give you a great road feel and confidence you cant get from other i4 FWD cars. Rain, mud, dirt, curbs. The Legacy eats it all up People who drive my car say wow.

I've been driving the 2013 Limited PZEV model for almost a week now, after my 2000 Impreza was totaled in a hit & run. One word - awesome! I test drove a 2.5 2012 Limited before trying the 2013 2.5 Limited - and they are worlds apart. The DOHC CVT changes in the 2013 model make a huge difference to the pick up and make the 2.5i engine feel much more capable. The interior space is great, the hands free works well and voice activation is very handy. Bluetooth audio streaming works well. Commuting on the peninsula <-> San Francisco I am currently seeing about 24MPG with fairly hard driving. I think EPA numbers are fair. AWD with the options on the Limited model make for value hard to beat!
