Other than the very annoying legal disclaimer that comes on every time you start the car, no matter what mode, the Nav is improved over 2013. Sound deadening is improved, but the tires are still too hard and noisy with the 2.0T (most people ditch them as soon as possible). Kind of odd that the Kia Optima has more features similarly equipped...
