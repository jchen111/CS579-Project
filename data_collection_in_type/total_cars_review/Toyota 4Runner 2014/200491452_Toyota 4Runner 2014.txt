I love my new Limited 4-runner. drives awesome, so glad we decided to go with this vehicle. Everything is amazing about the SUV, the comfort, the room, the leather, the sound system! I can't say enough good things about it!!!

Bought the 4 Runner LTD 4x4 after considering the Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Read so many many bad things about the jeep I got scared and decided not to purchase it.  The Runner is the BEST.  Reliable, rugged, 2 year service, excellent off round/snow and very good on highway.  The only thing I can say is "oh what a feeling".  I love the interior with the black leather.  I went to a wedding with it and everyone raved about the SUV.

Purchased a new 2014 4Runner and absolutely love it. Toyota did a fantastic job with the interior upgrades on the 2014 Limited. Exterior still has that bold yet classy look. Super comfortable interior, seats are the best I've sat in and ventalation/heat in them is great. 2nd row space is generous and storage area in the back is much larger than our old 4Runner. Power is adequate, however a 6th gear would be nice. Other than that love everything about this vehicle. Highly recommend.
