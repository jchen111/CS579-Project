Our family of 3 needed to get out of our Saab for mileage and reliability reasons, so we leased a Tiguan as VW has some really good lease deals and I wasn't ready to be married to a VW.
We've been pleasantly surprised at how much we really like the car, even though it barely meets what we said we wanted - a SUV that gets at least 20 mpg in the city.
It has much smaller cargo capacity than the others we looked at, but feels much larger in the rest of the car, especially in the back seat when extra cargo room isn't needed (most of the time) and the seats can go all the way back.
Its got a nice, compliant ride and feels nimble.
Has a much more premium feel than anything else in its range.
