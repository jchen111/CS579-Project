This is my first truck.
Previously had a Cadillac SRX and other crossover type vehicles.
 Decided most of what we did was hauling stuff.
We were surprised to end up with truck.
It is just as described in the reviews.
Comfortable, quiet, solid and gets better mileage than the SRX.
Solid 23 MPG from Washington, DC to CT.
Averages 20+MPG in daily driving, incredible for a full size truck.
Being my first truck, the Fun To Drive category isn't really there.
While good for a truck, it isn't up to the handling of the SRX.
Still I knew that going in.
The V6 does a great job, hauls my camper and boats.
I tested the Hemi, but it didn't seem to need it.
Very happy so far.
