I've had my 2013 Subaru Forester since February 2013 after my 1999 Subaru Legacy quit running.
 I use non ethanol gasoline and I'm averaging between 27-29.2 MPG since I purchased the car.
It has plenty of room and enough acceleration for normal & daily driving.
I am still disappointed Subaru does not offer a limited / leather model with a 5 speed transmission.
I decided to buy a 2013 over a 2014 because I do not trust the long term drive ability of the new CVT transmission yet!

I've owned other subarus
 and thought I'd try an SUV. Forresters were generally highly rated. I can't speak for prior year models, but I feel like Subaru really cheaped-out on this one. Pro-large cabin, good all around view, no blind spot, huge moon roof. Cons-cheaply appointed interior, leather seat wrinkled first week. the plastic is incredibly cheap, there is even just a piece of black "paper" behind the steering wheel as a dust protectant, not even vinyl. The body is thin guage steel, and you hear every "ping" from road debris. .The radio quality sounds like an old transistor.I am so disappointed, I am actually looking to trade it in, and take a loss....

I recently purchased a Subaru Forester Limited 2013 and it has been really tough on my back since I bought it. Of course, it felt great on the test drive, but now that I am driving it 84 miles per day, it is really causing aches. I try to stretch as much as possible, but this only seems to provide temporary relief. Getting back in to the car starts the cycle all over again. I splurged (out of budget btw) for the 2013 limited because Consumer reports said it was more comfortable to have power leather seats. So far, I have been disappointed. I previously owned a 2000 Lexus ES 300 and the seats were extremely comfortable.
