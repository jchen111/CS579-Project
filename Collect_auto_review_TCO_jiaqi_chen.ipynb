They've apparently solved the issue recently. We're getting better than EPA estimates, which is quite good for this size vehicle. The Outback has grown a lot since being a station wagon Legacy. It's now a full-fledged SUV, although, unlike most SUV's, it is sporty and utilitarian. Handles much better than expected (despite reviews I've read). Corners flat unless driven excessively hard.

As far as the mileage concerns I feel it is the way a person drives. The car is not meant for spirited driving. If you want that, buy something else. It drives tight and very predictable, although the gas pedal is a little touchy when accelerating from a stop. The ride quality is very good, a little firm but I wanted that over a soft ride.

The new 2013 Outback handles more like a sedan than even the 2010-2012 Legacy. I've had the 2013 Outback for a week now, the pull from the new 2.5 engine is great, fells almost like a diesel engine. The CVT is much more response than earlier, before, the RPM would hit 4k and sound like a motorboat. On the new Outback, the engine RPM goes to 2k and you feel a great push forward, without any extra noise.\n",

The first extended highway drive I encountered I found that the car wandered and I had to do constant corrections to keep it in the lane. It felt like driving on an extremely windy day but it was dead calm. I contacted the dealer and they advised to bring it in as it probably needed an alignment.

The crossbars do not work with many older Thule products (bike carriers, ski racks, kayak carriers), and they do not extend beyond the width of the roof line. For those outdoor enthusiasts who need to carry multiple items, we need to attach standard Thule crossbars. However, the design of the roof limits the front to back bar distance to 25 inches. This makes for a less stable kayak carrier or rooftop box. I am told that Subaru and Yakima have an agreed upon specific adapter for Yakima crossbars. Subaru needs to do the same with Thule, given the large number of Thule enthusiasts.\n",

But the car often feels as if it is fighting headwinds, even on gradual descents. I attribute this to the CVT, or perhaps a lack of power. There is also a noticeable vibration which travels up the seatback at idle. But the biggest disappointment by far: I am averaging 21-22 MPG with this car (60/40 city/hwy, non-aggressive driver). EPA combined is listed at 26, so I am not happy.\n",

I was aware that Subaru changed the engine and added a timing chain instead of a timing belt but, didnt know that the CVT was also revised. Reading old reviews I can tell you that the 2013 is \"torquier\" and responsive when you take off from a dead stop. Also I am averaging 28.5 MPG combined highway/city. Over 32 MPG on long trips. I have 3500 miles on the car already. The navigation IS a bit clumsy as I have seen other people comment on BUT, it is very accurate and believe me I am no Louis or, Clark :).\n",

If you drive a short distance- less than 5 miles, you can't expect anything to get the EPA rating. My wife drives 5 miles per day. Important- be aware of the tire inflation sticker. I thought my Cmax handled like a badly, but the dealer only put 32 psi in the tires- the sticker says 42! Make sure your tires are properly inflated, the sticker is in the driver's door jamb. \n",

If you drive with a bit of finesse and use the little cruise guide on the display on the left in city and cruise control on the highway you'll get very close or better to the advertised MPG. It does take a little practice to get comfy with the infotainment but practice makes perfect and only a bit more complex than my GM Saturn vue. If you do lead foot it you'll be surprised.

Not what you'd call nimble for around-town driving, but fantastic seats and big-car driving dynamics make it an awesome road-trip car. Excellent stereo.\n",

We recently bought a 2014 Highlander for 7-seater carpool purposes, and while it's nice enough it's not as all-around great as the Volvo. Toyota's only advantage: 2 more seats.\n",

In part this is due to use of heater/seat warmers. But as temperatures have increase in Maryland, EV mode has not returned and is still zero. The car goes automatically into hybrid mode. Gas mileage hovers around 35 mpg. Taking it to Ford dealer tomorrow...\n",

        "First Ford ever- had a 2007 Prius, and while loved the mileage didn't like the low-rent interior. Got this car, loved the interior, the solid-feeling doors, the high-quality plastics, leather seats - and the price w/Costco's auto program. First problem - a rattle developed. Dealer kept the car overnight (gave me a Lincoln MKZ as a free rental - nice!); turned out the antenna was loose. With 10k miles now, a few interior squeaks have developed. Mileage is great - averaging about 49 mpg so far. Electric range can vary from 18- 25 miles (okay, but....). regens nicely coming down from Big Bear to a full \"tank\"! MyFord Mobile app doesn't work well. Value charge feature - fantastic. Love the car!\n",
