I purchased the 2013 Toyota Prius 3 from Aaron M. salesman at Rusty Wallace Toyota in Morristown Tn...This dealership is highly recommend by me great people that really takes the time to make sure you get the exact car you have you heart set on...The Toyota Prius far exceeded my expectations....I love the way it drives and handles, plenty of room inside.. BEAUTIFUL exterior ... every where I go people go on about what a beautiful car I have purchased.. The fuel mileage is AWESOME...averaging 54.8 mpg ... If you HATE buying gas like I do I highly suggest you buy a Toyota Prius ...

I had decided to buy the Ford Cmax over the Prius without having tried the Prius.
I did so because I bought into the hype and I really did like the way the Cmax drove.
I also wanted to do the buy American thing. 

After 10 months and nearly 15K miles, never going over 37mpg, dealing with the many build quality issues (lots of them) I stumbled upon the NHTSA recall for the safety crash thing and said it was the last straw.


So I traded in the Cmax for the Prius.
And I haven't looked back.


The first 3 fill ups were 49, 47, and 45.
Already I got the MPG that the CMAX could not.
So it wasn't just me.
The Prius works great, is comfortable, and is an amazing build quality!

I purchased my first Prius in 2010 and have recently traded it in on a new 2013 Prius. This car is actually fun to drive and comfortable. my wife and I took 2 extended vacations to the mid-west traveling a total of over 15,000 miles. A lot of people refer to the Prius as a compact car. I assure you that this car is a midsize. I have nothing but praise for the auto. A 5 star rating should be a 6 or 7. We see the hybrids out there have really not caught on, Why, because on the charging of the hybrid has to be done with an additional exterior 240 volt power receptacle. The difference between the charging receptacle needed is that the Pruis uses kenetick energy to charge itself, no plugging in.

I've now driven this Prius 4000+ miles in two months. It gives better gas mileage than the other five Priuses I've owned!
And is as comfortable for long drives as any car I ever owned. My first Prius was the 2003 model, and I've driven all of them 100,000+ miles, around home and on long trips. Perhaps I'm small enough to be comfortable, but I really cannot understand the complaints about the seats for long trips. All Priuses have been excellent for driving in mountains, but the 2013 model is the best. No other car I ever owned climbed interstate grades easier in cruise control, and because of the transmission, no car descends steep grades better!
