I purchased my 2013 new in October 2013 and
just made in through the toughest winter in over 100 years with flying colors. MPG slips in cold weather but once the car heats up 42mpg+ is HWY average at about 70mph, sometimes more. To get optimum mileage a break in period is needed and then use cruise control whenever possible. I expect this car to last 500,000+ miles but not with 10,000 miles per oil change. I do that every 5000 miles now and may drop that to every 4000 miles which with the battery often pulling the car drops that even more. If you want it to last that long, you must change the oil more frequently. Absolutely the best engineered car in the industry today.

Well I have to confess that after driving BMW and Audi for the last 16 years and I still love bimmers. I have taken a real shine to my Toyota Avalon Hybrid. I purchased mine in June 2013 and funny things is I went to the dealership to test drive a Toyota Highlander Hybrid. I had been researching Hybrid vehicles and SUV's for a couple months and was convinced that Toyota had the most robust and reliable Hybrid technology on the market. (True Statement). 
I have receivied several compliments on my my avalon and so far, its been quite, efficient, reliable, and pleasant to drive. Very Impressive Toyota!
Buy one and you'll think twice on BMW, Audi, & Lexus. 42.9 so far ! Fantastic !

Purchased my Avalon Hybrid 2 weeks ago and cannot believe how Toyota developed a "near perfect car". During the first week, after being completely blown away at the overall quality, inside and out, the gas mileage was a shocker!!
The first tank of gas delivered 47.7 MPG. Now on the second fill-up and am averaging 44.6 MPG. Driving has been mixture of highway and city/town. WOW. What a surprise. Great value!!

For the last 9 years I've been driving my Sweet BMW 5 series and what a joy it was to drive on a daily basis. The power and road feel was superb but the maintenance was starting to get excessive. I have never owned a Toyota anything... The technology that is engineered in this vehicle is utterly amazing. I
love the Hybrid engine and transmission, its really quite astounding. The car handles well, it has excellent low end electric torque.
When driving in econ mode the entire hybrid system takes control and superbly enhances the Avalon's fuel consumption. The car is quite and has good rad feel.

This car is phenomenal  simply put it is the smoothest, quietest ride Ive tested in the last year, including Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lincoln and yes, Lexus. If you're in the market for any of these, stop and test drive the Avalon before making your final decision. Our test drive so impressed we immediately eliminated Audi, BMW, Mercedes from consideration. Even the base model oozes comfort and confidence. So, to us, the final decision was between Lexus, Lincoln (we waited for the new MKZ's release) and Avalon.
After the MKZ came out, we made our decision, and it was really pretty easy. So, forget about your preconceptions about Toyota! This begs my opening question, why buy a Lexus anymore?
