I am always surprised to see so few (I should say rarely) Insights on the road.
Toyota Prius seem to be the only hybrid people think of.
Not only the Prius is expensive, I am not so sure it's a better car: Insight
dashboard is better and the possibility of disabling the automatic traction(not available in the Prius) in case of getting stuck in the snow is a plus in the Northeast.
