I've owned this car for a year without any problems and it's been a fun to drive.
I wish it had keyless start and the upgraded infotainment system they put in the new Jeep Grand Cherokees.
Otherwise, I love the off road capabilities and the after market modifications that can be done.
I plan to own this vehicle for many, many years and so far no major problems at all!

I purchased my 2 door rubicon 2 months ago and have put 2500 miles on since. First time wrangler owner and I absolutely love this vehicle. I am used to driving German luxury cars with precise handling and power but I have a permanent grin when driving my ruff and tumble rubicon. My 4 year old daughter has little trouble working her way into the back seat. Do not buy one if you want fuel economy, excess room, or a smooth ride....do buy one if you seek adventure, your not afraid to get off the pavement sometimes, and you like to smile alot.

We drove a 2003 Honda Pilot for the last 10 years.
It was the darling of the automotive press when we bought it.
So that is the yardstick.
When going to test drive the Rubi, I expected it to be loud on the highway.
It isn't.
In fact it's pleasantly quiet, much quieter than the Pilot.
Huh? Yes.
Every review about Wranglers goes on and on about how crude they are.
We did not find this to be true.
The UConnect features work perfectly and intuitively.
We're happy with the Wrangler and enjoy the fun it brings on our local trails and off road parks.
