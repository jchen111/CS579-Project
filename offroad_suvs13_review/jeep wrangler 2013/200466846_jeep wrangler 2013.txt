Always thought a Jeep would be a cool - but
was concerned about reliability. With the new V6 and other improvements I decided now was the time. 

Best decision ever! I love driving this Jeep and off roading
in the mountains and desert of So Cal is great.

I get 17-18 city and as much as 23 mpg highway if I keep it at 65.
No problems or concerns to date. Currently at 6K miles.
