Purchased new, currently at 16 months and 13,000 miles.  The size of the KC truck is ideal for my purposes; roomy enough to accommodate two people (good sized) with luggage inside.   Its dimensions are not too big to handle todays traffic and parking situations, but are large enough to provide a comfortable ride.   I wish it were quieter but will try to improve this area with future tire selection.   I prefer the Frontiers more upright chair-like seating position over the Tacoma (the only other truck I considered).
