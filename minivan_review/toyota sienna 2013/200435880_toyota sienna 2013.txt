I recently purchased 2013 Sienna SE after
careful analysis with Sienna XLE and Honda Odyssey(EX-L and Touring). Below is my verdict on who wins in each category-

Exterior - Sienna SE
Tires/Wheels - Sienna SE
Tech - Odyssey
Features - Odyssey
Seating - Odyssey
Access to 3rd row - Sienna
Dashboard - Odyssey
Cargo Space - Sienna
Mileage - Odyssey
Price - Sienna
Drive - Sienna SE
Steering/Handling - Sienna SE 

Winner - Sienna SE by a margin

If looks and drive does matter to you, go with Sienna SE with Navigation pkg. If you want to opt for XLE, then Odyssey is a better choice. 
Odyssey pick up is not so good. 

Odyssey 2014 still looks bad when compared to Sienna.
