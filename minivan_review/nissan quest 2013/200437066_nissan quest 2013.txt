We had Honda Odysseys for 12 years one if them a top of the line Touring.
No real complaints but the Quest LE is better.
The vehicle is luxurious. The ride is superb for a van.
This van is overlooked by many buyers and as a result there are big discounts to be had on remaining 2013s.
Every gadget you could imagine .
Technically less cargo space than others but the seats fold flat to a
Make cargo room rather than get removed.
Leg room in the first row is wonderful.
I am 6.4 used to feeling crowded in most vehicles not this one

We purchased this van after getting frustrated from getting our 2-year-old in and out of our SUV (close proximity of parked cars and our doors). Like a lot of people, we didn't want to be a "mini-van" family. That was dumb. The smart key and power sliding doors and lift gate make it so easy to get my child and child-related stuff in/out of this van. I personally like that the rear row folds flat instead of into the cargo compartment (those are power too, but the pull strap is also really easy to use). We made a 400 mile round trip drive (bought the van and left), and there is plenty of cargo space; we were throwing a birthday party, and all the party goods and luggage fit very nicely.

Purchased may 2013. Like many features and would buy again. The biggest complaint is mileage but maybe its because it has less than 1k on odo. I drive like a dead person because I want to see a decent mileage number to get my wife off my back. She thinks I made a bad decision because I am only getting 13.1 mpg. I traded in my 2008 Yukon Hybrid getting 16.4 because it was stalling in traffic and dealer could not fix after three attempts.
