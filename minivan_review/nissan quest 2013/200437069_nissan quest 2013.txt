After 19 months of owning the 2013 Quest, its time to write down my review. 
So far, my Quest drives pretty well. No mechanical problem whatsoever. No squeaks, clanks, or any unwanted under-chassis
noise. Suspension is soft enough to silence Chicago potholes.
Electronic and power features all working great. Everything in the cabin still tight and in their right places. Captain seats are comfy and fabric is easy to clean. Storage is plenty for a family of four.
Overall, everything works accordingly, except for fuel economy. My Quest SV averages 12-13 MPG combined. It seems the CVT is not really helping the Quest achieve its MPG claims.

I thought it was only fair to wait several months to do a review on the van. In short, IÂm extremely pleased with it. I looked at all the major minivans and would say this is the best. Nissan was giving the best incentives as well.

Two tone dash and leather are well done.

With a high center of gravity there is a little roll, but the ride is on a par with a full size sedan for smoothness and quiet ride.

To get a flat cargo bed you can easily lay down the second and third row seats. You donÂt need to take anything out of the van like you do in other models to get a flat surface.


The gas mileage seems to be approximately what it is rated at 19 city and 25 on the highway.

We purchased the Nissan Quest back in February and so far we have not had any problems.
It continues to ride smoothly and comfortably.
The interior is very nice and still enjoying the luxury feel.
The performance and handling is good and it continues to be fun to drive.
I believe it is a good value for what you pay.
My only concern would be the third row seats.
It seems a little low for the average adult to sit.
I would consider another Nissan vehicle in the future.
