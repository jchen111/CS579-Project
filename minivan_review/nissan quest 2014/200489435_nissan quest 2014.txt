I bought a 2014 Quest SV two days ago.
I replaced my 2009 Honda Odyssey.
As I shopped for vans - the usual suspects were first - Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey.
I like a mid-level van with lots of features, but no leather (too hot where I live) - so as decked out with cloth as I can get.
The SV fit the bill.
The Toyota Sienna frankly felt cheap inside - no soft touch surfaces and the plastics on the dash were flimsy.
The 2014 Honda Odyssey was well put together, but felt basic unless you got the EX-L or Touring.
The Nissan stood out hands down - with lots of soft touch surfaces, wood grain dash, and leather wrapped steering wheel standard on the SV.

We have ALWAYS been pretty much Honda customers. In fact, since 1977 when we purchased our first new car
we have always for the most part purchased Honda. Well times have changed. We decided this time to take the Quest for a drive. It is simply the smoothest, best looking, best interior, at least
in our honest opinion. We were fortunate enough to catch the St. Pats day sale and purchased the SV model for approx $8k off MSRP. That has to be the best deal we have ever made, but aside from that, the Quest is so comfortable. Neither the Sienna or Odyssey felt as good as the Quest. BTW, our last two vans were the Odyssey. 
BTW...we purchased this van for retirement. We didn't need 8 seating.
