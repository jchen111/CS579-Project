I enjoy driving the Dodge Caravan so I bought one. There have been concerns about the six speed transmission. I have specifically rented a SXT model to haul film lighting.The rental was quite less than SUVs. The transmission is sensitive and needs understanding. The six speed transmission allows one to save on fuel costs whether driving through hilly country or flat lands at highway speeds. Carrying 1 ton of cargo, it drives well granted, you understand how to shift. There is a reason why the shifter is located next to the speedometer. 10, 500 ft above sea level it performed well on hairpin turns. Height, stow n go, 12V inputs, width, wheel size 5stars.

2013 Grand Caravan SXT; currently with about 10,000 miles on it.
I really wouldn't consider any minivan that didn't have some version of Stow&Go.
I have the second row seats folded down almost as much as I have them up, and I wouldn't like having to remove the seat to free up that space, since you then have to leave it at home and can't haul passengers in that area.

Other likes:
Great power, good gas mileage-I get 27 at 70-75 mph (town mileage is not great, tho).
Quiet, smooth ride.
Much less expensive to buy than Honda or Toyota.
Dislikes:
6 spd tranny is OK, but not as smooth or predictable as could be.
Driver's seat needs more rearward travel; legroom is limited.
