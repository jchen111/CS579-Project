All though the price was reasonable it really doesn't replace a van. By the time you put up the third row there is nothing left for storage. We bought this to replace our T&C because we wanted better gas mileage but could hold four kids. It can hold four kids, but thats it. No stroller, no shopping bags. It is made for either the occasional back row seating OR as a four seater with a trunk space.

When my wife and I decided to replace our 2003 Jeep Liberty, we set some stringent criteria. We wanted a car that could seat our baby, our 4-yo, and an adult or two on occasion, when relatives visit. However, it also needed to be small enough to maneuver easily in and out of parking spaces in suburban malls or NYC, get at least 20-miles per gallon mixed, and be fun to drive even on windy roads. Its outside had to look appealing, and its inside had to handle abuse from the kids well. Finally, it had to cost less than $30,000 with all extras. Frankly, we did not think such a car existed...until we found the Mazda 5. Our Mazda has turned out to be everything we hoped it would be.

a fully loaded alternative to a minivan, for half the price, but equally practical!
