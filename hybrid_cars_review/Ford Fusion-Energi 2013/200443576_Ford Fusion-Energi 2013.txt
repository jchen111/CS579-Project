IÂve now had my 2013 Ford Fusion Energi for one year and 10,000 miles.  I would like to comment on my likes and dislikes.  


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I purchased my Ford Energi as a model car with approximately 9,000 miles.
During the time I was test driving it and since I purchased the vehicle (I have now put about 5,000 on it), the battery died and needed replacing and it has been in the shop four different different times for a check engine light.


It may be a good car but I don't have much trust in its performance and reliability at this point.
My dealer has been great (responsive) but this car has spent too much time in the shop being repaired.
It only has about 14,000 miles on it now. Will I continue to see problems with this vehicle?
At what point do I suggest to the dealer that this may be a long term problem?

As a recent purchaser of this vehicle, I find the Edmunds review spot on.
I confess the price difference between the Energi and regular Fusion Hybrid gave me pause, but I went forward with the Energi version for all-electric weekend performance.
Thus far it hasn't disappointed.
Couple that with the fact that it appears as a normal sedan, and I was sold.

My commute in DC Metro is usually a long one, which will inevitably tap the battery after anywhere between 16-20 miles.
The economics of gas/electricity vs. price point of this car won't pay for itself against the Fusion Hybrid, but it is a convenience to not have my weekend in-town trips result in a fillup on Monday morning for work.
