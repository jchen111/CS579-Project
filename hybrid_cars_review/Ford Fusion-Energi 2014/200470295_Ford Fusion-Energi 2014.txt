I can't imagine someone being unhappy with this vehicle unless they got a lemon. It handles and drives amazing, the interior might as well be a lincoln in the Titanium trim. I'm a very new owner, so I can't comment on reliability yet, but it does what it says, and its not taking me 7 hours to charge. 1 hour puts 4 miles on the Bat life. Using gas less than expected. Drove home 45 mins from dealer and put on another 100 miles. Gas stuck on F. It takes off quick, not that I'd drive like that too often. I do not notice horsepower limitations on highway either. I love the keyless start, entry. No finding keys. No gas! I'm starting the think this is like a DVR or Smartphone, I'm never going back!

I have had my vehicle for 3 weeks now.
Have 850 miles on it and still have not been to the gas station.
I have a quarter tank of gas.
The interior of the vehicle is very nicely done.
The seats are very comfortable and supportive.
Fit and finish is up there with entry luxury vehicles.
The technology is quite advanced.
I have the adaptive cruise and blind spot detections system.
It also alerts you if you are in danger of an imminent crash.
The exterior styling is distinctive.
If you are considering a plug in Prius or plug in Accord, check out the Fusion.

I'm a car guy.
I've owned convertibles, sports cars, 4x4's commuter cars - you name it, I've probably owned it.
This car is ridiculous.
It's so advanced, so comfortable and so well designed it blows me away.
I could gush for hours about how completely enamored I am with it.
Ford knocked this one out of the park!
We just got back from a three-day trip in the California gold country and without being able to charge up for the entire trip, we still averaged 48 MPG with, shall we say, rather 'spirited' driving through the foothills.
The incentives and rebates take a huge bite out of the cost and we haven't visited a gas station in a month and counting.
Seriously, buy it.
