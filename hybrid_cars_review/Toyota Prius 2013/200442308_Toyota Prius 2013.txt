Purchased car last weekend - $27,500 OTD. Last minute decision decided to buy 72 mo/100K extended warranty that included routine maintenance for 48 mo/45K for $1200. 

Really enjoying the can so far - it's my wife's first "new car" - she;s always gotten my hand me downs. She drives 100 miles RT to work and she's loving it. I'll update as we own it a bit longer.

I purchased the prius persona in july and love this car, I previously had a Honda accord.
I recommend the black cherry color, as this is a limited edition color, so there aren't a lot of them out there. this car is loaded with features, and at only 26000 with o percent financing, this was just right for me. I am getting 56 mpg going to work everyday, 24 miles, 17 of them on the highway. I am currently getting about 52 on the highway and about 56 or 57 in the city, I live in Chicago, so the city driving is stop and go, which gets you better mileage, and I have learned how to drive to get maximum fuel economy without being "that guy driving like a grandma". would recommend

I did a lot of research before deciding on a Prius, and found that, though there are plenty of raving fans, there are also a lot of detractors.
I read reviews about unbearable seats, terrible road noise, lack of power, and poor driving experience.

After test drives, I decided to take a chance, and bought a new Persona model, which is basically an appearance package with a few upgrades, like the 17" wheels, navigation, and leather.

I've driven it enough now to comment:
the driver seat is as comfortable as any I've ever seen.
The ride and road noise are typical for any vehicle of similar class.
The power is great in Power Mode, the sound system is great, and the overall sense is great!
