I almost didn't buy it based on some of the professional reviews I read, but I decided to go by those written by real consumers, and I am glad I did.


The car is flawless, fun to drive, and very will built. I has enough power to get up on the freeway and keeps up with traffic while getting over 45 mpg, and I drive it very hard.


I have found the ride to be good, not harsh, and is similar to other small cars of similar weight.
I am 6'3" and have plenty of room and comfort.


It is not a Prius, and does not try to be. It is the original hybrid, predating the Prius.
The unit is one of the few fully built in Japan, and the quality demonstrates that very well.
