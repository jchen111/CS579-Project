Very happy with my CMAX purchase.  Buying the 2013 at the beginning of 2014 allowed a $5000 markdown on a new car, erasing the mark-up diff of a hybrid.  I have gotten 42 mpg city/42 mpg hwy consistently over 7000 miles.  (Sure I get higher when really trying!)  Pleased with the interior space width. Comfortable filled with 4 people.  No issues in 9 months of ownership! And paying for half the gas I used to.  woot woot!

In July my newly leased, left over 2013 C-Max had a dead battery after sitting overnight.  The clock on the dash said 8:38AM.  Road side assist came and jumped to start.  I called the Ford service center and was told "You must have left something on."  I was certain I had not. 
 
On, Sept. 14, 2014, I came out to find my car dead again.  The clock (coincidence?) read 8:38 AM; however, after the jump start the clock failed to  run.  
Thought!  For about 10 days continuing, the unlock button on my key was slow to open the passenger door and trunk lock.  Perhaps an indication of the battery voltage decreasing?

Tomorrow the service dept. will try to find the problem.  I'll let you know.

I loved the CMax on sight. I happily looked forward to the awesome 47mpg promised on the sticker. I drove off the lot a convert to Ford. I got over that
quickly. 33 days to be exact, when a tire blew out. Then a few days later, a second tire blew out. Ford said I hit a curb. I didn't. They said it was Michelin's fault. Then came the recalls, the USB connector that won't stay anchored inside the console, the audio that doesn't always work (they blame my iPhone), lame SYNC services, and the lies about the fuel economy. I am getting 41-42 MPG. Nice from the 25 my last car got, but I live in fear of tires blowing out (no spare/donut). I would trade it in if I could afford to.

Just bought the 2013 at Edmunds FMV. Very nice machine. Trip MPG is 47-48 if you stay at or bellow 65 MPH. If you drive with a bit of finesse and use the little cruise guide on the display on the left in city and cruise control on the highway you'll get very close or better to the advertised MPG. It does take a little practice to get comfy with the infotainment but practice makes perfect and only a bit more complex than my GM Saturn vue. If you do lead foot it you'll be surprised. Brilliant automotive engineering by Ford!

I am surprised by some of the negative reviews so I wanted to weigh in that I am at 11,000 miles and love my c-max.
I did get a late model 2013 and had to wait for after recalls.
Maybe they fixed the glitches before I got mine.
LOVE IT!!!

Everything is great except the quality.

We purchased a C-Max for our business and it has been a disaster.
When it works we loved it... Is it worth it to have a vehicle that may leave you stranded at any point?
"NO."
You cannot unlock doors without power.
We have had to abandon the vehicle and use an alternate to get our work done on three occasions.


I was so pleased to give Ford another chance but what a disappointment.

Do not buy this car until they figure out the bugs and fix them.
I will never buy another Ford.

I loved my c-max at first.
Didn't mind the first time it went dead for no reason. I thought it was my fault. But after the third time...Come on Ford, stop making excuses.
Now it is in the shop again and they tell me it is the transmission that has to be replaced!
Really, only 30,000 miles in 1.5 years and I am driving a rental for the 4th time.
I travel for a living.
I want out of my lemon, but can't afford to trade off because of the upside down amount.
Guess I am stuck.

Bought my wife's C-Max June 2013, at 12,000 miles now and the car has been perfect. I believe that Ford has ironed out the kinks in early models (late 2012 - early 2013) -- we have had no problems with dead battery, SYNC system, etc. Recommend this car to anyone who want the high MPG of a hybrid with decent handling, acceleration and creature comforts. We paid $26,000 out the door and are very pleased, good job Ford!

I'm over a year and 15,000 miles into ownership now. Car is holding up nicely.

Since late 2012, Ford has issued several updates and recalls for the car to increase safety, MPG, and reliability. This may damage consumer magazine reliability scores, but results in a safer, more economical, more reliable car for all current and future owners -- I admire Ford for doing it. My mileage went up 1-2 MPG after the new software, for instance, from 36-37 to 37-38.

I loved this car at first
But now it has locked me out and won't start 
I got over it the first and second time but now we are on the eighth time
Every time I have taken it to the ford dealer i bought it from(this is the third time) they give me a different reason and say it is fixed after they are done
They even said it was my remote start i had put in even thought it did it twice before I put the starter in
They told me i had to remove it cost $177.00
Oh and that remote start cost $650.00 to put in
But I live in the country we have a lot of hills 
I am trying to get rid of the car because I have a two year old and need something that is reliable
