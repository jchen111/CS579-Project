Not hard to see why they call this car "iconic" - it performs very well in every category.  It's a geek's car in every good sense; the techy dash keeps you informed of your efficiency, and encourages you to drive intelligently; the 50mpg average is easily attainable.  Plenty of room front and rear; I'm 6ft-3in, and can set driver's seat for me, and still be comfortable in the driver-side back.  Comfortable ride, good pickup on twisty hills, and good cargo capacity with seats folded (seats up, still a good grocery hauler).  Not a flashy sporty car, but does the job it's built to do, and does it in solid Toyota style.

Me:6'3"(240 lbs) "tall back"
Headroom (good): few inches to spare
legroom (good): would be nice if the steering wheel telescoped a few more inches toward me, so I could move the seat back more. (can live with it though - not unsafe to drive).
legroom width (good) - plenty of side2side room
visibility (good): Rear View is just a little restricted.
Would be nice if side view mirrors were larger/larger field of view.
display (good): placed away from driver for ease of viewing.
-smooth ride so far (new car)
-quick acceleration when needed
-back head/leg room (ok)
-It's a commuter car (mpg=priority#1), not a luxury sedan.
Toyota did an awesome job.
