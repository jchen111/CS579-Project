This is the best car I've ever owned. Front seats are very comfortable. It is whisper quiet even at high speeds, has adequate storage area, seats 4 comfortably. We decided to lease the 2014 because technology is changing and - like a laptop - it could be hard to resell a few years from now. We got the $7500 rebate, a great trade-in on the 2006 Prius and the payments are incredibly low - $183 a month. The quick charger works great and recharges the car in a few hours and the city paid for half of the cost! It's a no-brainer: it's the perfect second car for running errands around town and 90 miles will cover a lot of errands! Love it!!

If you live where it rains or snows don't buy this car. The car body designers never drove this car in rain or snow. The spray from the tires creates a truly ugly car within miles. The snow build-up in wheel wells and the 6-12 inches of crud on the running boards is beyond annoying. Try to buy a splash guard post-factory? Not available without a special order and a 4 to 5 week wait. The actual driving range in winter is lowered by several factors: 1. less charge in cold temps (10-12 miles less) 2. if you use the climate control 15 to 20 miles are subtracted from your range estimate. So if you want a car that can go 50 to 60 miles and turn your garage into an ice rink...this is the one.

I was not convinced about buying the leaf at all. It looked weird and all the popular auto mags did not seem convinced. A friend convinced us to take a second look and we bought it as a second car ... that was four months ago. 

So far...
- The lease + gas is approx the cost of my previous monthly gas bill. I am basically driving a new car for no extra cost.
- - I have taken out my gas car about once a month ! I visited my Costco gas station after four months !!!

Its comfortable, spacious and very well equipped. I would have preferred to buy the SV with the BOSE + cameras in hindsight. 

Bottom-line: if you commute < 60 miles / day, buy a leaf - you wont regret it.

 We were tired of paying $ 80 per tank to run around town getting 16 MPG running errands etc.
This Leaf is fun to drive and has lots of room I am 6.4 and do not fit with comfort in many cars but the headroom in this is great.
After 2.5 months of ownership very happy get 90 mile range on a full charge.
Able to charge for free at many Nissan dealers .
Fast charger at dealers will get you a full charge in 40 minutes.
Electric bill has gone up about $ 50 per month charging up almost every night.
I did not purchase the level 2 charger as I can charge overnight in about 12 hours with the 6.6 KW on board charger. Our utility company gives better rates for EV owners if you use off peak power

We now have a 2013 LEAF. we used to have the 2011 for 2 years and many wants have been added to the 2013 like ECO mode stays on, braking mode. Also better estimate of range. The Air Cod is also more efficient. 

We love our LEAF.
 We lease and every 2 years can't wait to see how they improve it and lower the cost. Our daily commute is 44 miles round trip. It's easy with 50 60 left each trip. I can go about 100 miles on city streets when needed.

A friend got 188.2miles o 1 charge by driving at the lowest
cruise control of 25 mpg.
Pretty cool.

Comfortable, roomy all electric car. Amazing not using any gas. Haven't used our other cars since we leased it. Overall pleasant car. Roomy, good visibility, handles pretty well, well built, generally well thought out. 
Compared to Volt, better visibility, seats 5' much better electric range, quick charge option to charge in 30 minutes. 
Good lease deals available. Factor in gas savings and the car is practically free.

My commute consists of 5 days a week 33 miles each way on mostly highway (55-60mph) with limited city traffic.
I can drive back and forth to work on 1 charge with no problems of range as I pull in my home with about 30 miles of range.
You must get a home charger as the trickle charge (regular 110 outlet takes to long to charge).
I installed for $1800 the AV Charger which is a 220 volt/30amp charger which charges the car from empt to full in 3-3.5hrs or about 26 miles per hour of charge.
The information above is based on driving in April and May in Central NJ.
I have not driven the Leaf in the colder temperatures but I will post a follow up this winter.
