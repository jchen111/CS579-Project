I got the Pricus C 3 for 1 reason, the advertised MPG.  I have an 80 mile round trip commute that consist of 85% highway driving and was tired of filling my SUV up every 3 days for $55+ each time.  I now average 64MPG each way and fill up every 6 days for $25.  I'm totally blowed away with the amount of money I'm saving.  There are loads of YouTube videos that show how to drive a Prius, I highly recommend them if you do buy a Prius.

As for the car itself I find the seats to be very comfortable, the build materials are fine after all it is an inexpensive car.  The 3 level has some cool features like push button start, doors unlock when they detect the key, and touch screen with navigation.

First a disclaimer, this is my first hybrid and my fourth Toyota. 

Secondly, this is a sub-compact, economy, hybrid. So comments about lack of room and poor acceleration are a little silly. If you want a luxury or sports car, buy a luxury or sports car!

I absolutely love this car. I considered the Prius lift back, but am so glad I got the Prius C Three. The cargo storage is limited, but with the fold down seat it's adequate for my needs. The interior is not plush, but it's very nice and comfortable. I love the look of it all!

The Prius C is extremely easy to park. The turning radius is super short. The radio and navigation system are awesome. I average 55+ MPG!
