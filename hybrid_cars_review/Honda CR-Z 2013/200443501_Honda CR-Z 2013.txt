Purchased the CRZ to replace my old CRX which had 400,000 miles on it. I drove the CVT model and it was very dull. However, the Manual transmission is tons of fun to drive. I look for reasons to drive this car because it is so much fun to drive and the gas cost practically nothing.
Price of the car was a bargain and with the 3 different driving modes I get the feeling like I purchased 3 different cars. I can drive fast and reckless in sport mode, or slow and fuel efficient in ECO. 
Overall this car is extremely fun to drive; the instrumentation on the dash board makes me feel like IÂm flying a space ship. But donÂt expect the Porsche like handling that the CRX delivered.
