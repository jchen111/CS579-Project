So far, the car has been great. It drives so smooth and the instant torque I get from a dead stop is a delight after dealing the turbo lag on my Outback XT for 8 years.  The EV range covers my work and weekend commutes so I can go months without having to buy gas. Getting the HOV lane stickers is great along with the $1,500 rebate from the state. I also got a time-of-use meter from my local utility (Pasadena) so I get cheaper electricity rates during mid and off peak times. They also gave me $300 of LED lightbulbs!  The car is sluggish in ER mode while driving in the city but, has been fine on long trips. I average 37 to 43 miles MPG depending on how fast I'm going. 
No issues ... yet.

the volt is a poor car. I have had one for 2 years and have had a radiator replaced a water pump. The radiator cost $1100.00. I took the dealer 3 days to get it back to me. It now needs a battery. The battery cost 300.00 and it has a leak in it so when it goes to the car wash it leaks on the passenger side. that will cost 400.00. In the past I have bought 9 chevrolets. THis is my last. Save yoursellf the grief and look at a Prius.

Day one, test drove the vehicle all was good paid for said vehicle, 2 miles from dealership CEL comes on, I call OnStar they report a charging cooling system not operating properly.
I take it back to the dealership immediately they can't get to it until the following day.
They put me in a rental I then head home.
Couple days later the car is ready for pick up and I was told it was an over use of brakes.
5K miles new CEL, I call OnStar they report a charging cooling system not operating properly, I take it to a different dealer.
Nine days later they replace 5123 drive motor battery coolant cooler, as per DTC P5034.

I cannot believe I have had so many issues with my Volts. I bought two Volts in 2012, and both of them were bought back by GM due to major issues (One would die with no power at all, and another had a Regen Drivetrain Bearing failures) . One of the two I accepted a 2013 Volt thinking they worked out the Bugs...they did not! I could not recommend any GM product after the way that they have treated me. The director for Chevy after sales told me they would not fix my car. I have been in and out of the dealer way too much for a then $45k car! Buyer beware, read the Volt forums and look up Bearing issues in the drivetrain. You will be happy you did before pulling the trigger on this crap!

First of all, the Volt is a blast to drive.
As my first GM vehicle in 20 years, I was impressed. I was very happy.
Then charge light warning came on and it was back to dealership, then the charge door and again the charge door. The bearing in front driver's side went, had it replaced and then replaced again.
A lot of trips to the dealership and missing work. Live in Michigan and charger was plugged into an external outlet.Well with the nasty weather we are having moisture must have got in the connection and fried my charging cord.
GM is saying it is 100% fault of plug and will not cover.
$475.00 to get new charger.There goes my gas savings and my GM loyalty
I am done after this lease.

I like big cars, fast stuff, and trucks.
So I'm jaded.
First off, all the reviews that say the Volt is ugly are lame.
It has yet to make any small children cry or make the cow's milk sour.
It looks good.


The interior is nice, and well appointed.
Navigation is in the speedo area where it belongs.
Rear seating is for kids.
A 6 foot man will hit his head and knees, but will fit.

Handling is tight.
Feels nice.
I have a Vette and a CTS-V, and race alot.
Car feels lighter than it is.

Acceleration is OK.
I'm used to big power, but it is as quick from a light as a Crown Vic.
 Not bad.

Braking is excellent considering the tire size and weight.
Use L in city driving.

This car is a great car to drive. I have owned the car for 12 months and have used about 12 gallons of gas!
I am currently getting about 550MPG. If you dive less than 35 miles per day on average then you can get significantly higher gas mileage than what is published. The car normally runs on electricity until the batteries run low and then automatically switches to a gas powered generator to power the electric motor. The battery will typically give you between 30-40 miles per charge depending on driving habits and outdoor temperature. My average commute per day is about 27 miles. My car is running on battery 95% of the time and uses gas 5% of the time. My favorite car that I have owned.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've been driving the Volt for 18 months.
I loved the car until a month ago when I went to unplug the charger from our garage outlet and the outlet was melted - very scary situation. 

I've spent a month trying to get GM and my dealer to do something (Woodward Motors in Andover, MA).
GM wants me to produce the license of the electrician who built my house in 1982 before they do anything. No joke...

Don't buy this car, it's dangerous and GM and dealers don't stand behind it.

I've been buying cars for 40years. The Volt is like no other. The smooth quiet power is nicer than any V8 I've driven.
I've had my Base Chevy Volt here in PA for 10 months. Have been to the dealer one time to rotate the tires at 5k .. have not been to a gas station yet. I've used just 5.7 gallons of gas in over 7,000 miles of hard hilly stop and go city driving. That's 1200 mpg!!
I have a wattmeter on the charger that indicates that the car is costing approx. 2cents per mile. I've only used the range extender a few times... but was sure glad I had the extender. It's nice to NOT have any range anxiety.
It's a nice feeling not going to the gas station every two weeks to charge about $60.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I decided to give the 2013 Volt a try after my '10 Prius hit 90K. My car is loaded with almost every option and I paid 34K before tax credit. I drive 36 miles r/t to work and usually make it on electric.

Pros: Tight, drives like a vault, quiet, smooth.




 Technology




 Int and ext styling.




 Fantastic economy




 Buying an american car

Cons: Price even after $9000 dealer discount




 Craftmanship--lots of problems




 Poor ergonomics 

The center stack has buttons scattered about, seat heater turns on by itself, electric charger door fell off, 110v charger stopped working, trim pieces fell off, ipod stopped working, poor craftsmanship.
