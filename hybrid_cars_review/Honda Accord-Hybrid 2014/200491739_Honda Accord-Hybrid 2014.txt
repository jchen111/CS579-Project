I got the car 2 weeks ago and drove around ( Houston to Dallas trip) too.

I was driving like a grandma for first 300 miles ( really low acceleration) and there on my friends drove it for 300 miles with full acceleration ( 10+ power bars).

At the end of 1000 miles I got 39.2 mpg ( good I would say).
Ride is comfortable for the long drives). Once I hit 60mph instant mpg drops
to 36 and if I take it beyond 75mph it improves. 

Touched 85mph with just 3 power bars and ride is still feels smooth ( low noise).

After about 2,000 miles I would like to give as accurate of a review as I can on the 2014 Accord Hybrid. First off, this is not a sports car - don't get me wrong, when you take off "econ" mode and hit the gas this car moves great, and it has VERY responsive handling and braking. But this car begs to be driven conservatively & casually (picture Low Rider playing in the background while you are out cruising). The reward is a car VERY comfortable, easy to drive, with INSANE gas mileage. The 47/50 ratings are wrong - they are LOW. We regularly drive about 50/50 mix and get 52-55 average - maybe warmer weather helps some. Can go 800 mi per tank. Same quality Accord as always with high mpg.

I've had my base Hybrid for a month and put a little over 2K miles on it. It's been amazing so far. I've averaged about 48 mpg so far in mixed driving, which probably be higher if temps didn't drop below freezing which caused me to average about 36 mpg on my current tank. Handling is good for a big sedan, and it feels like it has as much power as my former '04 Accord EX-L V6 Navi. Brakes are smooth and linear, unlike the jerky brakes found on the Prius's I've rented. Seats are supportive and comfortable, and the interior fit and finish is quite good. I find the infotainment system to be decently intuitive. The base audio system is ok, though not great.
