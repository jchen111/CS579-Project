I just passed 10k miles with my Accord Touring Hybrid, and I remain an enthusiastic owner. Lifetime average mpg is 49, About 1500 miles coming from highway driving. Everything I wrote in my original review remains true, but I have a couple additional observations. l max charge the battery at least twice a day without any problems or new noises. I recently tried driving in "B" instead of "D" and after 300 miles am averaging 53.8mpg vs. the normal 51 I get with local (non-highway) driving. Best speeds for good mpg are 40-50mph. Worst is 35mph and >55mph. Max speed for EV mode is 70 mph. Great mpg in hilly driving, less so in flat areas. AC pulls down mpg if temp is above 85 degrees, not below.

There are quite a few reviews on here, I have to say I agree with them all. While the car isn't perfect in terms of transitions, you get use to it. My mileage is the same as most..  If it's cold I get in the high 30s and if I turn off the climate system I get 45-55 depending on hills. 

My real concern is more in the form of a question for other owners.  When going down a long hill, once the battery reaches max charge, my charging system or whatever is running in regenerative mode, seem to get louder and louder.  At first I thought it was overheating the charging system, but as soon as you bring the battery down a bar the charging sounds normal again until you hit max charge again. Anyone?

This is the 4th Hybrid car that I have owned.  The other 3 were Lexus ES300H, Lexus CT200H, and a 2012 Camry Hybrid.  All previous models got the exact MPG that they stated they would give.  This Accord with 5k miles on it, isn't even close.  I'm averaging 39 mpg.  When I talked to the service department at my local dealer, they gave me the old Ford answer...you have to break it in?  Wow!  The other 3 I did not have to break in...why would you a Honda?  Also, I am getting a loud popping noise out of the drivers side front end.  At the end of the day, this car has some nice features for safety...but it is certainly not worth more that $6k more that the Camry Hybrid.

I purchased 2 Honda Accord Hybrid Touring sedans for my house hold and neither one has gotten close to 50 mpg.  I installed the HFP 19 wheels with Continental ContiSport 3's on my Touring sedan (from my old Accord coupe) so I can forgive that car of under whelming me in the MPG dept.  But with that in mind the car seems to hesitate a lot during highway speeds above 55 MPH.   Not sure what sure what the cause of this is.
The other car has achieved 42 MPG once and averages 37.  The driver of this car is VERY conservative so the problem isn't how the sedan is being driven.  I hope that this a break in period thing. Neither car drives in EV mode more than %10 of the time.

I purchased my Accord in January.
I commute to work with it daily, and we use it for road trips whenever we can.

Despite what a few individuals in the automotive press are saying, this Accord DOES achieve the EPA mileage stated of 47mpg highway / 50 city.
As an actual owner, I can truthfully state this is the case.
If anything, the EPA mpg estimates are LOW, as I've been able to get far better mileage without any special effort on my part.

Two things will affect the mileage you get with this car: cold weather, and running the A/C climate controls in manual.
Best to use Automatic.

I registered ~2800 miles on my 2014 Accord Hybrid Touring, and I gotta love it! I had to learn how to maximize mpg, which is my focus in this review. First, my hybrid starts with lower mpg on every trip and builds as I drive. Best mpg requires about 10 miles of mixed driving (or longer on the highway). Second, one is not rewarded for slow acceleration (in EV mode). This drains battery power, and reduces the number of miles driven in EV mode. Best mileage (51 mpg average this month, 48.5 overall) comes from accelerating quickly enough to engage the gas engine and easing back to EV mode once you have reached cruising speed. Slow deceleration is always rewarded, as is downhill battery charging.

I got this car 2 weeks ago it amazing to say the least . I got 52 mpg on a 64 mile trip, on small hwy , with stop an go sometimes 4 way stop signs
I posted a 2 minute video, you can watch it in my link . Search you tube ' physics honda hybrid' The system is very smart. And you can run on ev mode when the battery is full in city. This trip is on hilly roads. One trip on interstate I got 37mpg, but it was cold and I pushed the car. When you switch the Econo button off the car feels so powerful and fast. Acura dampers make the car feel luxury and sporty. The change between driving modes is seamless but I do feel when engine mode kicks inn.
No doubt this
the best hybrid in the market now.

Just picked up my Accord Hybrid Touring edition a few days ago. Quiet, smooth, reasonable power.
I have a question to you other owners. I can't get my hybrid battery gauge above 6 bars, and gas mileage above 40 MPG
Does your gauge go to the full 8 bars?
I'd like to know before I ask the dealer.
Came out of a Mercedes E350, not the same standard of luxury, but I love all the techno gadgets.

I recently owned the Lexus GS AWD 2013 model, but upon learning of the Honda Accord Hybrid touring model, options, styling and reviews, not to mention MPG, I swapped.
This new gen Honda is shockingly high end on the inside and outside.
If you ignore the badging, you likely would think you were in a something from Acura, Lexus, or possibly Audi.
The features and so rich and high end.
I was only test driving for fun because of the MPG and I was instantly sold.
The tech inside of the this touring model includes a very feature rich GPS, massive connectivity features via bluetooth with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the wife's 5s.
The Adaptive Cruise is outragous and the blind spot monitor!!!

We purchased the Accord Hybrid shortly after its recent arrival at a local dealer, attracted by its 'new' hybrid technology & claimed mileage. We had the chance last weekend to take it on an Interstate highway trip of about 450 miles, and found it to be very comfortable and achieved about 43 mpg on the trip despite driving almost the entire trip at the 75 mph posted speed limit.
One can imagine the economy potential for more restrained highway driving.
Beyond the comfort and mpg factors, we enjoy the fact that the Accord Hybrid looks like every other Accord on the road - no geeky look like the Prius or other 'green' cars.
The build-quality is solid, the design fine. Built in the USA-Ohio!
