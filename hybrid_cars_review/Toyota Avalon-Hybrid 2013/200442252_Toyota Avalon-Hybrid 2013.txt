Purchased my 2013 Limited Hybrid in December. Now have a little over 9k miles. The mpg is definitely as advertised. It gets better after the break in period. Just did a round trip from New Jersey to Boston and averaged 40.5 mpg. The
controls on the dashboard are extremely sensitive. It takes some getting used to. Over a period of time I learned to adapt.As others have stated, the ride can be a little harsh. However, this does not diminish my overall satisfaction with the vehicle. I would highly recommend it.

After owning this car for one year and 16,000 miles I I must say it is the best car I have owned. I have owned many cars.
Among them Corvette, Lexus, Mercedes, and several BMW's and although each has their own claim to fame the Avalon hybrid Limited overall is the best. Comfort, quietness, interior and exterior styling and quality, handling, power and features, and best of all mileage put this in its own league.
I consistently meet or beat EPA mileage estimates even at freeway speeds of 80 mph plus. I can easily travel for several hours without stopping and in complete comfort.
My next car in three or four years will likely either be another Avalon hybrid or the Lexus variant.

This is my first hybrid. I am loving the 40+ MPG I am getting!! This is amazing. The safety extras like cross traffic, pre collision, 10 air bags, etc. are great. I am getting spoiled on the warnings for backing up and changing lanes. This car is comfortable and roomy in the front and the back seats.
Love the technology package, and the wireless charger! Love the heated and ventilation seats. Love the leather everywhere. It's an awesome car! I like the tighter drive. I believe they are attracting young drivers too. I had some 20-30 year olds stating they loved how this car handles, and were thinking about buying one. And my parents who are older love it! Best kept secret out there! Luxury!

Other than 2 interior minor problems due to cheap materials, this car has been perfect!
I average 39+ MPG without babying it.
I leave it in "Eco" mode unless in the mountains -- then I put it into "Sport" mode and have a great time shortening the winding roads!
"Normal" & "EV" modes are worthless.
Why I left Mercedes E Class: The limited Avalon has more safety features tan Mercedes even offers yet is over $20K less out the door.
Front facing RADAR makes driving extremely comfortable.
I arrive relaxed after a few hours of California Interstate Insanity... set the RADAR cruise to 75 MPH and have satellite music playing softly.
Six thousand mile trip was flawless.

My history of five BMW's, two Lexus's, one Mercedes added a 2013 Avalon Hybrid Limited with the tech package. I have put 9,000 miles on it since June and it is probably the best car I have owned. It is very stylish inside and out, luxurious, quiet, quick and very frugal on fuel. On a recent trip to Mesa. Az, the Kanab, Ut. to Mesa leg with speeds from 75 to 90 yielded an actual mileage of 38.2 MPG.
Passing on the two lane roads was amazing. Accelerating from 70 mph and pulling back into lane over 100 mphÂwith a hybrid! This car does not lack for power! In Blizzard Pearl the car receives constant compliments and people often stop me to ask questions about it. What a car!

Expecting 40 mpg on my third day of ownershio I changed my style of driving to more suit the personality of the car. With three passengers achieved 43+mpg.
Today, travelling rojte 9 NJ achieved 52+ mpg. Frigging amazing as I was travelling with the flow of traffic and at times accelerating beyond the last'pod'.
This is far superior to diesel poqedered vehicles. My comparison is based on driving from New York to Florida in a VW diesel Passat.
So far, totally impressed.
This is the sleeper of the century!!!

I looked at probably 15-20 different vehicles..but i liked the idea of not being held hostage to the price of oil and the fact that this car is a luxury vehicle and gets 40mpg city is just amazing. I bought the full tech limited package..Pretty much same car as Lexus ES Hybrid only around 3k less. To get Toyota Quality/Reliability coupled with 40/39mpg/Luxury trim options, high end tech is just a really deep value...I can't think of a better value in the space. Lincoln MKZ Or Ford may have simliar but how long will it last? How much will maint be? After owning a german car the last 13yrs which was great but had horrible electric/hvac issues such a breath of fresh air to drive a Toyota.

My wife and searched for months for a replacement for our Volvo S80. We decided to go upmarket, so we looked at Lexus, Infiniti and BMW but didn't find a car that felt right for the price.
Then I read about the Avalon Hybrid and decided to give a try.
Wow, am I glad I did that. The simple bottom line is this: I can't find anything to complain about in this car.
Acceleration, braking and handling are all extremely competent.
The turning radius is great, visibility excellent, engineering outstanding.
Even a full-size trunk!

We have put 6000 miles on the car in mixed city-highway driving, averaging 40 mpg. A joy to drive and own.

I considered several vehicles before recently purchasing my Avalon Limited Hybrid with tech package.
I ultimately decided on the Avalon as I have had good reliability with prior Toyota's and it had a nice balance of driving fun, size, and fuel economy.
I also feel the interior was superior to the slightly more expensive Lexus similar hybrid model which was a pleasant surprise.
I have not noticed any glare problems from the dash chrome as some have complained.
I also have had no interior issues with the headliner which was also a complaint in some reviews.
I find the ride slightly more stiff than I would prefer, though still nicer than many other vehicles I have driven.

My first car was a 78 Celica and I've had Toyota's ever since, this is the best of them.
Great style, great design, excellent quality throughout, great mpg, great value if you cross shop Lexus, BMW, or Infinity.
Keep the car in eco mode and you'll get 40+ mpg.
Switch over to Sport mode if you need some kick, not a sport sedan but still entertaining. I went looking for a hybrid when my commute doubled, tried Prius, Camry, Lexus ES300H, Ford C-Max & Fusion, the Avalon has the best balance of comfort, luxury, handling and fuel efficiency.
I paid more than I was planning but worth every penny.
I expect to keep this car for 15+ years so the cost per mile is well worth it to me.
