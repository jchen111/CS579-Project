We bought the Taurus SEL AWD V6 after trading our 2010 Escape Limited. Our SEL was upfitted with the 201A package, then they added heated leather, 8 inch touchscreen with voice-activated navigation, moonroof and it was still $5,500 under a Limited. If you don't need the Sony sound and a few other costly and unnecessary options, the upfitted SEL is the better buy. 18" wheels give it a smooth but assertive ride and its a very confident car to drive. The V6 does a great job and surprises you with how well it really pulls consistently from zero to 100+...not neck snapping but very fun. AWD excellent in nasty conditions, very quiet and a great value with incentives and rebates.
