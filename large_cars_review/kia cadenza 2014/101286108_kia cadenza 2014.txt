Overall, this is a great vehicle, especially with a lot of them still on lots. It's not a rocket but it's fast enough, especially when passing. It's quiet with just a hint of wind noise. I do about 70/30 highway driving and don't go crazy on the gas and still get 27 mpg combined. Most significant disappointment is the stereo/nav system. While the stereo sounds good, it won't blow out any windows. The navigation system needs an overhaul. Directions can be pathetic at times and add unbelievable routes. Maps lose almost all detail after the 700-feet setting and I've had major highway ramps disappear at some resolutions. A great car but still just a pricier Accord or Camry.

KIA of Somersworth is a great local dealership. Brian the Sales MGR does a great job without the heavy sales pitch.
I've been looking to trade in my 2013 KIA Optima SX for the new KIA Cadenza. Took the Cadenza for a test drive , the first thing that comes to mind is " what a beautiful car" Through out my initial drive of the Cadenza you just keep saying this is incredible. The interior is nicely appointed with high grade materials. There is a lot of attention to details right down to the stitching of the leather seats. The instruments are easy to use. The Cadenza Premium with a MSRP of 35k comes with a lot of nice features from Navigation heated seats,293HP V6, 18 inch chrome rims,infinity

I just leased a new 2014 Cadenza with the Premium and Tech package. I choose the black exterior with white nappa leather.
I then -after market had my windows tinted. I put $ 4300 down and did a 36 month,12,000 annual mileage lease. My monthly payment $ 299. I have approx. 1300 miles on the car and have enjoyed every second behind the wheel. Previously,I have driven lexus,Infiniti,BMW,etc and this beats them all. The features that are on the Cadenza would cost a minimum of $ 10-15,000 more on other vehicles. This vehicle is extremely well appointed and handles beautifully. A very happp customer and driver !

I had an optima which I really liked. Great car and gas mileage with many options. I was impressed with the craftsmanship of that car. When I took it in for service and I saw the new Cadenza I had to drive it. Well nit only did I test drive it I drove it home. I have 10,000 miles on this car already and enjoy this car more everyday. I get about 21.5 on a average for gas mileage which I don't think is bad for such a large car. Around 24-25 MPG on long trips.

My last four cars were (I lease) a Lincoln Continental, Lincoln MKX, and 2 Cadillac CTSs.
I switched a KIA Cadenza. Im not quite sure why. Price was not the issue. I really liked the car. Both the reviews and my impression of the car from a visual perspective made me lean towards making a change to a KIA. Frankly, Im a bit of a snob and dropping down in class caused me some concern. But once I got over the status hump and took a chance on this car I have been very much pleased.
This car offers everything and more. It may be a little early. But too date, Ive found it to be a great car and not really a drop in class just name. I might feel a little hurt by not having the Cadillac name

Just purchased a 2014 Kia Cadenza with Luxury Package and not looking back. A great all around car with a sport/luxury persona. The handling and engine response satisfies my joy of driving. The look, comfort and size makes it a very solid The interior is smooth and practical. Its old school with a modern touch. The navigation, voice command and bluetooth is key and learning(or reading the manual) is a breeze. Trunk space is awesome. I don't miss GM. I welcome my new car plus 3 year full maintenance plan! My experience with Hyundai and KIA have been through family and friends. As years pass, quality and convenience has become their calling card. I am glad I answered.

I'm leasing a fully loaded Smokey Blue Cadenza with the Premium, Technology and the white Napa leather packages.
I have gotten lots of compliments.
The car is very good looking.
I've had the car for 2 months, 2,300 miles now and am quite impressed with it.
The fit and finish, the quiet and smoothness of the engine and the ride is comparable to the luxury nameplates that cost several thousand dollars more.
The technology features are great and for $42K sticker it has every bell and whistle you can think of.
If you are tired of paying big bucks for a prestigious hood ornament and want understated elegance and value, do yourself a favor and give this car a look!!

I just want to mention that we have now bought a booster pillow at Target for the passenger seat as shorter passengers cannot see over the dash. As much as I love the car, I've never had to do this before.

It has been about three weeks and 1000 miles since I leased this new Cadenza.
If someone would have told me 6 months ago I would be driving a Kia, I would have told them they were crazy.
But I read about it in some comparison tests and was driving past the dealer, so I randomly stopped to take a look. I was impressed with the aggressive style, and the smoky blue metallic had me hooked.
They pulled it right out of the showroom and off we went for a test drive.
As a very loyal Toyota and Lexus owner for over 20 years, and the lack of aggressiveness (especially Lexus on the ES) to make a deal pushed me over the line and away I went in the new Cadenza.

This past weekend I took my first road trip (800mi rnd trip); I was more than thrilled with how it handled. ItÂs seriously autobahn ready! The Cadenza was solid at all speeds 70, 80, 90+. No matter the speed, it continued to accelerate with very little prodding; and the steering remained precise/accurate. MPG: On the 1st leg I avgÂd 28.7mpg, on the 2nd I averaged 28mpg; I was NOT driving economically. :) In the city, I have averaged 22mpg so far.

The features and appointments crammed into this car are ridiculous! To get the same size of car, with the same features, I would have to spend at least $15K more. In short, there are no dancing rats anywhere near this car; it is a joy to drive!
