This Avalon has a terrible design flaw. The interior chrome trim around the controls, air conditioner vents, and doors cause a blinding glare when driving in the sunlight. I have had many Toyota vehicle and have always been very pleased until now. I have written and called Toyota, called and written AutoNation and offered solutions but have not been offered any solutions from these companies. Before you purchase search the internet for Avalon glare problem! I wish that I knew before I purchased.

I have had my Avalon for about three weeks. It came equipped with Michelin tires. I really like this car. I bought the Touring especially to get the Blind Spot Monitoring in the outside rear view mirrors and the Rear Cross Traffic Monitoring. I had to buy a lot of options that I will never use just to get these and to my opinion they are safety features that are well worth it and they work real well. The car rides nice, handles good with little or no road noise. Really plush and comfortable seats and interior. Great choice for me

 Have owned a 2014 Avalon Touring for about 3 Month's now.
I owned a 2012 Camry SE V6 and it was awesome.
I feel in love with the new design of the Avalon in 2013. When I was able to trade out even and not upside down on Camry I did.
Yes, I had to go to more than one dealer to make the deal but finally made it work.
My 2012 Camry was $26K with all the toys and the 2014 Avalon Touring was $33K plus tax and tag.
For a $7K difference it was an absolute steal.
The ride is much better than the Camry.
I love the interior design too.. wow, upscale all the way.
Quick of the line and a great vehicle to drive on the Turn Pike..
I am extremely pleased.
The Edmund's figures were on the money
