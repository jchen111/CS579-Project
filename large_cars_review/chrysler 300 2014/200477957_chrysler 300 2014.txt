bought my new chrysler back in march of this year and i loved it. But this past month has made me think twice about buying another one it has 6000 miles on it and it already needed battery and alternator replaced and by the end of this month they are going to replace the whole transmission and re program the whole car. Hope this is not one of chryslers lemons

BOLD styled, no one will ever confuse your 300 with the Avalon and Genesis, Azera, Buick. Many dealers will give you a great deals on the Base Model if you time your purchase right. The BASE model is well equipped;
you get a lot for the money and you feel like MILLION BUCKS. The BASE trim is a true luxury car.
