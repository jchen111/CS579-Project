Previously had a 2009 Genesis 4.6 - great car but rear wheel drive was a problem for Indiana winters.  After four years, switch to another brand auto, but neither the car or the service was what I had with Hyundai.
The Azera is the only front-wheel drive from Hyundai that is in this class.  Extremely comfortable, fun to drive, great features, and extremely good value.
This is our fourth Hyundai, and their customer service is equal to or better that what I experienced with my three BMWs, one Infiniti, and one Acura - I have absolutely no reason to go to another brand.
