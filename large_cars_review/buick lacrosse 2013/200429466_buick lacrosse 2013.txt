We have owned 5 Jaguars in the last 13 years.
Our last one was the worst car we have ever owned so we made sure we checked out the new car we were replacing the Jag with carefully. This car rides and handles just as good as the Jag XF (a tad slower when you punch it) but the interior is roomier and the electronics actually work! So far this has been a real surprise and very reliable.

I traded in a 2008 BMW 528i on this model and thus far love it.
The interior fit and finish is every bit equal to the bmw, and it is more comfortable and quiet on the highway than the bmw was even new.
I was able to get it equipped exactly the way i wanted to, with the driver confidence package, entertainment and navigation package.
It helps that I'll be able to get it service locally, rather than driving an hour to a bmw dealer.
The look of the car is awesome and i hope that i'll have luck with it.
While the rear visibility isn't great, the blind spot monitor is very good and the V6 has terrific passing power.
My friend, who is 6'2, was able to sit comfortably in the back. Awesome car
