I bought my 2013 Chevy Impala LT with 16k miles and I've had the vehicle now for 1 year and put an additional 12k miles on it.
I have to say I am very impressed with this vehicle because of the value it offers.
You get GM's flagship 3.6L V6 engine with the 6 speed automatic in a full size sedan for under 16k in the current model year.
That's almost 50% off sticker for just 16k miles.
For the money, there isn't a better deal on a vehicle out there (believe me, I've looked).
Great daily driver.
Not a sports cars, it's a full size sedan designed to be comfortable and reliable.
MPG numbers are spot on too, 17 City and 31 Highway.
Go take a look at one!

I will not address the vehicle appearance, interior appearance or "creature comforts", those are all subject to personal preferences which are as numerous as the populace.

I can address only the mileage of this vehicle.
I own this vehicle, entered service 8/12, now with 30K miles, plus/minus.


I drove 320 mostly freeway miles in the last two days at 33 plus miles per gallon.

The returning mileage in terrible friday traffic of 7 hrs vs the 3 hrs getting there was still barely over 30 mpg.

The lowest mileage recorded in ALL traffic has been 24 +

This car is a great car. This first review posted before me shouldnt be advised to read. This car is a joy ride. I have not been in a smoother ride. It is a very comfortable car. It is very spacious. Every one i've had in the car wanted to fall right asleep in the seat. It does'nt get the best gas mileage but for a sedan with some speed its perfect. Some one who is losing speed on turns should probably turn off the traction control and remember a impala is not for turning on a dime. I like this car and it runs great. I would recommend this car for a great american made sedan and will tell you if your looking at this car, get
it, it's great

After 800 miles, I can honestly say I'm ready to get rid of this car.
When the car is cold, the acceleration can only be described as herky-jerky and the car loses power when I turn right.
The gas mileage is also poor - about 17 mpg.
I haven't had the time to take it into the shop, because it would have to stay there all day long.
Terrible car.
