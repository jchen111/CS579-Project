This model is one before the new versions came out.  It seems really basic.  The engine is far but does not compare to the newer models at all.  Interior looks a little dated and the exterior looks the same.  Interior space is nice and seats are comfortable, truck has ample space.  Good full size car for travel but not for everyday usage.

I have had my car for a year, so far, no problems. Yes, Edmunds thinks the car is to plain, no flash or modern styling. But I personally don't need that. I just want a solid, large comfortable car for a reasonable price that is reliable. That's all. It gets about 20 mpg around town and 30+ mpg on the freeway. Plenty of power to pass on the freeway. The car has a speed limiter on the car, it's set at a maximum of 112 mph. So if you want to go faster, you will have to rechip the computer. I can carry six people, but it's more comfortable with a max of four. I bought the base LS model, has every option
I need. And it has more options than the base 2014 Impala for a cheaper price!
