I have a 2013 SXT Plus AWD Charger V6 with 8 speed auto transmission with the bells and whistles.
Great Ride!
Pluses:
35 mpg on the highway due to Econo Mode where 2 cylinders shut down on road trips.
Very stable in turns, it is a heavy car, just over 2 tons.
Very nice and smooth acceleration, interior very comfortable.
It has many amenities that much more expensive vehicles have.
Love the styling.
AWD works great.
Minuses, really minor.
The head room with the sun roof is barely enough for me at 6'2".
Rear headroom is low.
Trunk is roomy, but trunk entrance is not.
Need funnel to add fuel additives or else spill occurs out wheel well (surprise!).
Overall best car I ever drove!

Purchased the vehicle in March and enjoyed driving it until the transmission went at 5,000 miles.
Still waiting for new transmission and it's been about a month.
Very dissatisfied with Dodge.

We just had 16 inches of snow and the AWD SXT 8 speed handles it better than my Mazda Tribute SUV. Braking and cornering is a dream. I can't even tell when the vehicle is shifting gears... smooth as butter with great exceleration when you need it. All in a V6! 

We are averaging 24 mpg (mostly highway). Better than the soccer-mom-van we traded in for our "midlife crisis" car. JK. 

Actually, we plan on giving this vehicle to our daughter after she learns to drive. I feel happy she will be getting a "hand me down" this safe.
