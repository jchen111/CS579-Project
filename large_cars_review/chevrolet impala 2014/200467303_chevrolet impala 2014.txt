We love our new 2014 Impala LT. So far it seems to be a very good car in every aspect except one...there is a distinct grinding/rubbing noise when the brakes are applied.
The dealership has not been able to identify, solve the problem.
GM is researching the issue. The dealership has examined all parts of the brakes and cant find any problems, yet the noise is there, it is audible and it is annoying (especially now the we are tuned in to it).

I have not seen this problem identified in any of the many consumer reviews I have read?

So far I have been highly impressed with the 2014 Chevrolet Impala!
We were first introduced to it when we rented one to travel down to Harlingen, TX.
When we realized Consumer Reports named it as the number one sedan, we made the decision to purchase one ourselves.
We have not been disappointed in our decision.
