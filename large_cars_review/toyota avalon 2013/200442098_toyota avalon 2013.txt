So I have 42k on the car. It has been reliable and low maintenance. The backs of both seats have fallen off. I went to Toyota and they said it is a common defect but since I drive a lot they want $800 to fix. It is clearly a poor design but Toyota doesn't respond. I bought the 120k bumper to bumper but was told after it isn't bumper to bumper and that they "have good sales people". My car is embarrassing to sit in.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toyotas will run forever and hybrid design is solid.
The car is quiet and the seats are great.
The interior build quality is terrible however.
My headliner warped in the first 4K miles, the dash creaks and pops when you hit a dump and the door panels also creak constantly.
A happy customer tells four people about their experience and unhappy customer tells 10 people.
The crappy part is I have to sell it at a loss to buy the ford fusion.
My gut told me to go with the ford and I should have followed it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My chiropractor suggests a different car.
At 8K miles the rattles are popping up all over.
Empty car seat, controls, my flesh and my clothes shake and vibrate (sometimes violently) if the road isn't perfectly smooth.
The "fuel mgmt system" allows one to drive less than 350 mi before refueling even tho there is still >100 miles fuel on board. e.g. all four displays reporting the need for fuel must be ignored and I have to go by the odometer.
Dealer & Toyota say that can't be changed.
"Dist to empty" = 0 really means >100 miles to empty.
Brake Assist feature is truly dangerous in heavy traffic.
I happen to be strong enough to press my own brakes but Toyota knows better than I!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've owned this car for less than a week and have 2 problems with it, the back of the driver side seat panel broke and the headliner is falling down. The sad part of this story is that Toyota knows about these problems and kept letting dealers sell this defective car. This is not an isolated incident, check Toyota Nation to read other owners with this same issue. Toyota is finally issuing a bulletin to the dealer on these problems. The dealer will fix it under warranty but I don't feel the same, I expect a new car to be trouble free not have to be rebuilt.

Had planned to purchase a Lexus 300H but found local Lexus dealers not buyer friendly.
Decided to look at the Avalon as an alternative and made a purchase which I now regret.
The hybrid platform performs wonderfully; power is adequate and economy is better than expected.
So far with 5000 miles average MPG is 40.1 with 70pc highway at speeds 70+ MPH.
My main issue with the vehicle is interior build quality/fit/finish.
 I have owned many cars over the years and not since the early 70's have I had a car with so many interior rattles.
It is unpleasant to drive the vehicle on anything but newly paved roads.
Ride quality is firm, but not unpleasant and seats are adequate for long drives.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Really got sucked in by the new and beautiful exterior of the 2013 Avalon.
Only to find it so very uncomfortable compared to my 2011.

Did not sink in until after the purchase that this car is 2" shorter than it's predecessor, with most of that coming off the rear passenger leg room,
which is Critical TOYOTA!
I often have my office associates with me, and they are big guys!

Now they are cramped!
Why would you make the flagship car.... SMALLER?
If I wanted small, I would buy the Camry.

And the front seat is narrower, and less comfortable.
Front seat comfort of the Avalon has always been an issue; now it's much worse!
(for the distance driver).

2013 Avalon Limited with every option. I really enjoy my Avalon. I would put it at 4 out of five stars for about every category. Overall, this car represents value for the money. It is sporty yet refined, pretty fun to drive if you never push the limits and has enough technology built in. It has its faults like every car and Toyota. It's no sports car. And for a Toyota I am not impressed with the build quality. Surprising problems with a falling headliner and rattling door with the stereo playing. I haven't had the rear view or dash glare problems that some have complained about. I mostly think those are bogus. Toyota's Entune works sporadically with my iPhone 4 and I am disappointed with it

Had it built about 2 months ago. I got the red with tan interior. I am completely satisfied with the buy apart from one issue, as stated above. The suspension is rock hard. I'm not entirely sure i'll be able to put up with it forever. My previous car was a 2003 subaru outback. The subaru was MUCH more comfortable and also had better handling. A 41,000 dollar car like this should be MORE comfortable than a 22,000 dollar subaru that's 10 years older. The suspension really is unfortunate. I also feel somewhat cramped in this car. My outback was very open and didn't have quite as much legroom, but it had tons of headroom and hiproom. That's something this car doesn't have.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I feel in love with the color and design of the car.
But I am not happy paying the amount of money and not being happy with the ride in the city.
My biggest complaint is the JBL sound system.
I bought my car in Maryland and drove back to Georgia to snap, crackle, and pop.
The radio fades in and out at will.
Thank goodness I have a great Toyota service department near me.
I will take the car in tomorrow, get a loaner and they will find out how to fix this problem from their tech department.

I purchased the new Limited for a recent trip to the Southeast.
The car's performance was wonderful and very comfortable for the long haul.
The bonus features were the navigation system and blind spot warning system.
Stereo system was awesome.

I especially appreciated the comforts of adjustable ventilated/heated seats and lumbard/thigh support.
We loaded the car with golf clubs and three larger suitcases with room to spare. Great handling/ride/responsiveness.
Our trip was around 3300 miles and averaged 31.0 MPG - in combined driving - fully loaded.
This was somewhat surprizing, as the lowest MPG was 27, when climbing into higher elevations.
Great Toyota- great ride.
